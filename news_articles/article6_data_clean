The Telegraph,Tories turn to Boris Johnson to counter Reform,[],Ben Riley-Smith,17 June 2024 at 3:40 pm·4-min read,17,June,2024,03:40:00,4,"Boris Johnson is being drafted in by the Tories to play a more active role in the election campaign as the party seeks to counter the threat from Reform UK.Tens of thousands of letters signed by the former prime minister, who has been pictured on holiday in Italy, are due to be delivered to voters later this week, The Telegraph can reveal.It comes after the Conservatives warned that a vote for Reform risked putting Labour in power for “a generation”.The direct mail drive urging people to vote Tory is Mr Johnson’s closest involvement yet in the Conservatives’ attempts to defy the polls.The Prime Minister and Boris Johnson once had a close relationship, but it became increasingly strained after Rishi Sunak's resignation as chancellor in 2022 - Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesAmong those voters believed to have been targeted are wavering Tories who backed the party when Mr Johnson was leader but are now tempted by Reform.On Monday, the Conservatives issued their starkest warning over Nigel Farage’s party yet after the Reform manifesto launch, saying: “If you’re thinking about voting for Reform, and a generation under Labour scares you, there’s only one way to prevent it: vote Conservative.”In the last fortnight, there have been discussions about Mr Johnson appearing in person on the campaign trail to boost the party’s fortunes.He has not been in the UK, however, with Carrie Johnson, Mr Johnson’s wife, posting pictures on her Instagram on Monday night of the family on holiday in “beautiful Sardinia”.Photos show the former prime minister relaxing on a beach with his wife and children on the Italian coast.Carrie Johnson posted a holiday photo on InstagramIsaac Levido, the Tory campaign manager who also ran his 2019 election bid, is known to admire his former boss’s communication skills. Mr Levido and Mr Johnson have been in regular contact during the campaign, including about how the former prime minister could help out.But it remains unclear how much Mr Johnson is willing to do to support Mr Sunak, a man many of his allies still blame for his ousting from Downing Street.Mr Sunak’s resignation as chancellor in July 2022 triggered a ministerial stampede for the exit door, with Mr Johnson resigning 36 hours later.So far, Mr Johnson has limited his campaign role to video endorsements for individual MPs who have asked for them, and pro-Tory columns in the Daily Mail. But those articles often make no explicit mention of Mr Sunak, and the video support messages made public so far have tended to be for loyal allies.On Monday, another campaign video by Mr Johnson was released in which he urges people to vote for Alice Hopkin, the Tory candidate in Normanton and Hemsworth, to avoid handing Labour a ‘super majority’. He urges voters: “Don’t let Starmer get away with it.”Mr Sunak and Mr Johnson have not talked during the campaign, according to one Johnson ally, suggesting their relationship has not fully healed. They had shared texts about Israel-Gaza policy issues the day before the snap election was called.One ally of Mr Johnson told The Telegraph he was still weighing up whether to campaign in person. Asked why the Tory campaign wanted to deploy him, the source said: “The simple answer is he gets cut through. That is a rarity in this Conservative campaign.”Sources in both the Tory campaign and close to Mr Johnson dismissed any suggestion there was friction between the two camps. They stressed Mr Johnson had not turned down any specific offer to join a campaign event.One idea had been that that he would campaign in Red Wall seats that he won in 2019. In the past, his allies have said Mr Sunak would have to call and ask for his help.With limited time before the election, Mr Johnson’s overseas commitments complicate the situation. He travels abroad again this week and is due to return only shortly before polling day.He sees himself as an election winner and he may be reluctant to appear as part of a campaign facing defeat, especially should he ever wish to launch a political comeback. One ally predicted that he would not end up doing an in-person campaign event.The Tories are still trailing Labour by around 20 percentage points in the polls with less than three weeks before the general election on July 4. Some polling analysis suggests they could be left with under 100 MPs.Mr Sunak, under pressure after months without improvement in the polls, has faced calls from some Tories to “go for the jugular” in attacks on Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader.The campaign is now also talking up the prospect of a Labour “super-majority” to sway voters back to the Tories. But Mr Sunak has avoided personally talking about that possibility, insisting he can still win the election.A spokesman for Mr Johnson said: “Boris Johnson has always said ‘vote Conservative’ at every election, and he continues to say that this time.”"
Sky News,Sir Keir Starmer considering mandatory voter ID review,[],Sky News,Updated 18 June 2024 at 8:18 am·2-min read,18,June,2024,08:18:00,2,"Sir Keir Starmer has said he is concerned by the impact of mandatory voter ID and is thinking of reviewing it if he gets into government. Speaking to Sky News ahead of tonight's deadline to register to vote in the general election, he said the policy may have some flaws.Follow live general election updatesThe Labour leader told Sky News: ""I think we need to review and look at the ID rules. I am concerned about the impact. I won't shy away from that.""But my message today is remember your ID when you go to vote this time round because it's so important that people who want change do vote for change.""Under rules introduced by the Conservatives in 2022, people eligible to vote have to produce some form of photo ID to cast their ballots.This general election is the first time photo ID is required everywhere nationally. Previous by-elections, local elections, and police and crime commissioner elections have required ID before.The changes were brought in to stamp out what the Conservative government claimed could potentially lead to high levels of voter fraud.But the Electoral Commission said the number of offences has been minimal and instead, there was a risk the policy could put people off voting.Read more:What counts as voter ID?Manifesto checker: What are the parties pledging?The Commission found 14,000 people were turned away during May's local elections for not having a required form of ID - including Boris Johnson who introduced the requirement.Of particular concern to campaigners is the risk of disproportionality to the policy.According to the elections watchdog's research, poorer people, disabled people and ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by the rules and may not have as much access to voting as the wider population.👉 Tap here to follow Politics at Jack and Sam's wherever you get your podcasts 👈The Lib Dems have promised to scrap the policy in their manifesto and Sir Keir today has made his strongest signal yet the policy may be scrapped under a Labour government.The current government's assessment of the cost of introducing the voter ID policy put the total as high as £120m over a decade.A former cabinet minister who pushed the bill through parliament claimed the policy did not work.Jacob Rees-Mogg said the plan had backfired on the Conservatives because many older people were the ones most often caught without the correct ID."
The Independent,Nigel Farage pledges to run for PM in 2029 as Reform manifesto slated by economists,[],Archie Mitchell and David Maddox,17 June 2024 at 11:54 am·6-min read,17,June,2024,11:54:00,6,"Nigel Farage has parked his tank firmly on Rishi Sunak’s lawn with a manifesto designed to win over disgruntled Tory supporters and an extraordinary prediction he will be prime minister after the 2029 election.Launching Reform UK’s so-called “contract with the people”, the arch-Brexiteer appealed directly to right-wing voters with policies including a freeze on non-essential immigration, scrapping net zero targets and pulling Britain out of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).His controversial pledges came as one prospective candidate was forced to stand down over historical comments urging people to vote BNP, while another described Adolf Hitler as “brilliant”.Jack Aaron, who is standing against defence secretary Grant Shapps in Welwyn Hatfield, made comments online praising Hitler’s “brilliant tactics”, while Syrian president Bashar-al Assad was “gentle by nature”.While right-wingers revelled in Reform UK’s wishlist of pledges, economists and experts ripped it apart for its fantasy economics and dangerous high-carbon anti-net zero policies.Sam Fankhauser, professor of climate economics and policy at the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, University of Oxford, told The Independent: “Reform UK would like Britain to be a high-carbon island in a low-carbon world, missing out on 21st-century technology, innovation and growth. Our own research shows that the UK can meet its 2030 net zero targets with just six to eight billion pounds of additional public sector investment a year – a small price to pay for a liveable planet.”Meanwhile, the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) concluded that Reform’s sums “do not add up”.Reform UK chairman Richard Tice (left) and party leader Nigel Farage launch ‘Our Contract with You’ in Merthyr Tydfil on Monday (PA)IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson said the party’s planned spending cuts, such as its £50bn crackdown on “wasteful government spending”, would save less than stated, while the proposed tax cuts would cost tens of billions of pounds more.He added: “Even with the extremely optimistic assumptions about how much economic growth would increase, the sums in this manifesto do not add up. While Reform’s manifesto gives a clear sense of priority, a government could only implement parts of this package, or would need to find other ways to help pay for it, which would mean losers not specified.”The impact of Mr Farage on the campaign was underlined again as a Redfield and Wilton poll put Reform level with the Tories on 18 per cent, both well behind Labour on 43 per cent.But it all came as anti-Brexit campaign group Best for Britain said Labour could stop Mr Farage in his tracks with a potential victory in Clacton if the electorate votes tactically.Speaking ahead of the launch, the Reform leader said he was “launching a crusade to defend British values” and that the location was chosen “because it shows everyone exactly what happens to a country when Labour is in charge”.In a sign that Reform’s policy document was not a serious programme for government, Mr Farage opened the event in Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales, with an admission: “I’m not going to pretend we’re going to win.”Instead, he announced that the policies were issues his party planned to pursue in his self-appointed role as the “opposition to Labour” as part of a campaign to ensure he is prime minister after the 2029 election.Mr Farage lashed out at the soaring tax burden, touting £90bn per year worth of tax cuts for voters and a shake-up that would take 7 million people out of paying tax on their earnings altogether.Click here for our live coverage of the general election campaign.The manifesto launch comes just days after Reform overtook the Tories for the first time in a national poll. It is still expected to win just one seat, with Mr Farage standing in Clacton, but threatens to deprive the Tories of majorities in tens of seats across the country.In a sign of increasing panic over the rise of Reform in the polls, a Conservative Party spokesperson responded to the manifesto launch by saying a vote for Reform “risks delivering an unaccountable Labour majority”.They added: “That would hand Keir Starmer a blank cheque to raise your taxes, take no action on illegal immigration, and even rejoin the EU, with no way to stop him.”And the Tories warned that if Labour got in, it would remain in power for a generation.Nigel Farage was criticised for spending more in the Reform UK manifesto than Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-Budget (PA Archive)Reform said its manifesto pledges would cost £141bn to implement, setting out proposals to save £146bn to fund them.Tax expert Dan Neidle immediately noted that at least £38bn of Reform’s tax cuts were unfunded, about twice the unfunded cost of Liz Truss’s disastrous 2022 mini-Budget.But Mr Farage insisted the document showed “radical, fresh, outside-the-box thinking”.He said: “It’s not what you’re going to get from the current Labour and Conservative parties who are virtually indistinguishable, frankly, from each other.“Is this radical fresh thinking on economics? Yes. Is it radical fresh thinking on constitutional change? Yes. Is it a very radical change in the way our education system is currently bringing up our young children? Yes.”And, in a sign of Mr Farage’s package appealing to traditional Tory backers, the usually Conservative-supporting Taxpayers’ Alliance said the manifesto offered Brits “real relief”.Mr Farage addressed criticism of the cost of the package by saying the party would merely be campaigning for the measures over five years as the voice of opposition to an expected Labour government.The manifesto also delved into the so-called culture wars, promising a ban on “transgender ideology” in schools with “gender questioning, social transitioning and pronoun swapping” prohibited.Nigel Farage signs a copy of his party’s manifesto following its launch in Merthyr Tydfil (PA Wire)It also proposed a “patriotic curriculum”, which would include pairing the teaching of Britain’s history of slavery or European imperialism, with a non-European occurrence to “ensure balance”.Reform promised to make St George’s Day and St David’s Day public holidays, pledged a Free Speech Bill to “stop left-wing bias and politically correct ideology” and said it would scrap the TV licence, which funds the BBC. It also vowed to fast-track North Sea oil and gas licences.Mr Farage added that Reform wants to “simplify” the UK’s tax system, which it says totals more than 21,000 pages, while Hong Kong’s is 500 pages.The party is also proposing to lift the minimum profit threshold to £100,000 and reduce the main corporation tax rate from 25 per cent to 15 per cent in three years, which it says would “free” 1.2 million businesses.Elsewhere, it promises to abolish business rates for small and medium businesses by introducing an “online delivery tax” of 4 per cent for large companies.Mr Farage’s party also pledges to cut fuel duty by 20p per litre, scrap VAT on energy bills, scrap stamp duty on sales below £750,000 and ditch income tax for those earning less than £20,000.The document also states that inheritance tax would be scrapped for 98 per cent of all estates."

The Telegraph,Starmer: Blair is right that a woman has a vagina and a man has a penis,[],Dominic Penna,18 June 2024 at 6:00 am·2-min read,18,June,2024,06:00:00,2,"Sir Keir Starmer has agreed with Sir Tony Blair that a woman has a vagina and a man has a penis in a strengthening of his previous position.‌The Labour leader praised the former prime minister for stressing the importance of biological sex in a magazine interview this week.Sir Tony said he was “definitely of the school that says, biologically, a woman is with a vagina and a man is with a penis”, adding that politicians had got themselves into “a muddle” over the issue.The definition of a woman has troubled Labour under Sir Keir’s leadership with the opposition leader coming under fire over a number of his past remarks on the issue.‌But when asked whether Sir Tony was right, Sir Keir told The Telegraph: “Yes, Tony’s right about that. He put it very well. I saw it reported, I’m not quite sure where he said it. But I agree with him on that.”‌In 2021, Sir Keir claimed it was “not right” to say that only women have a cervix amid a row involving Rosie Duffield, a Labour MP who has campaigned to protect single-sex spaces and asserted the importance of biological sex.‌In April last year, the Labour leader prompted further criticism after saying that “99.9 per cent of women… haven’t got a penis”.‌Three months later, he hardened his stance on self-identification by saying that a woman is “an adult female” after a backlash against the SNP’s planned gender reforms, which ultimately led to Nicola Sturgeon’s political downfall.‌During a phone-in with LBC Radio on Tuesday, Sir Keir emphasised the importance of single-sex spaces and argued that “side rooms” should be used in hospitals to accommodate transgender patients.‌“I passionately think we should protect single spaces for women and girls – that’s something I’ve been clear about for a very long time,” he said.‌“Whether that’s in sports, whether that’s in the work I did, particularly in the support refuges for those that have been subjected to violence, physical or sexual, it’s very, very important that we preserve that.‌“Or indeed in our hospitals. It’s actually NHS policy for wards to be single-sex, and the only reason that routinely isn’t the case now is because the Government has lost control of our hospitals.”‌A Labour government wants to make it easier for people to change gender by obtaining a Gender Recognition Certificate, signed off by a single family doctor.‌Under current laws, a panel of doctors and lawyers have to approve the certificates, which the party has called “futile and dehumanising”."

I know that will make a difference.""In one of his videos last week, the former PM said he was “passionate” that voters should re-elect ally Sir Simon Clarke, who tried to oust Mr Sunak as leader earlier this year warning that the party faced an electoral “massacre” if he remained in charge.

The Telegraph,‘It’s a ticking time bomb’: Social care is the election issue nobody wants to talk about,[],Charlotte Lytton,18 June 2024 at 6:00 am·7-min read,18,June,2024,06:00:00,7,"For the past 12 years, dementia has plagued Chris Saunders’s life. His father was diagnosed with the disease in 2012, his mother four years on, and in a streak of unbearably bad luck, his father-in-law just days later. “It was just horrendous,” he says of trying to juggle looking after his loved ones with work and raising his son. “I’ll never recover.”Saunders is one of the many caught in Britain’s social care abyss.Paul Burstow, the former care minister, once described social care as “a third rail issue – you touch it politically and you get fried”.  Looking at its recent handling – and avoidance – by politicians, it’s not difficult to see why.Under England’s current system, care home residents with savings and assets worth more than £23,250 pay for all their social care costs, without a limit.Back in 2017, Theresa May’s manifesto proposed raising that threshold to £100,000. But family homes would have been included in that threshold for those in home-based care for the first time, prompting a furore in which the plan was dubbed a “dementia tax” and subsequently watered down by May.Two years later, in his inaugural prime ministerial speech, Boris Johnson promised an “oven-ready” solution to social care, saying “we’re going to fix the crisis in social care once and for all”.The former prime minister Boris Johnson during a visit to Westport Care Home in September 2021, ahead of unveiling his plan to fix the 'crisis in social care' - GettyCovid intervened. Then a plan to cap lifetime care costs at £86,000, due to be implemented in 2023, was bumped to October 2025.Now, for families who had hoped that this election would finally deliver the type of reform they have been promised for the best part of a decade, the issue appears to be a giant elephant in the room. Perhaps a direct result of previous occasions on which party leaders have been damaged by the issue, it is, it seems, largely being ducked this time around.The Tory manifesto recommits to the party’s 2025 target for a cap on costs. But it mentions dementia just once in its three pages on social care, saying that a future Conservative government would publish a separate strategy to ensure it, along with other common conditions such as cancer and heart disease, “receive the best possible care”. Labour’s manifesto, meanwhile, announced that Sir Keir Starmer would “create a National Care Service| to deal with a “sector [that] needs deep reform: there are inconsistent standards, chronic staff shortages, and people are not always treated with the care, dignity and respect they deserve”. The lightness of detail prompted the King’s Fund, a social care charity, to state that the Labour manifesto “largely dodges the issue of social care reform”.Yet dementia, which one in three of us will develop in our lifetimes, is currently blowing a £42 billion hole in the economy each year. Mark MacDonald, associate director of advocacy at Alzheimer’s Society, describes it as “the greatest health and social care challenge of our time…. yet dementia isn’t a priority amongst decision-makers”.In the absence of an existing cap on fees spent by an individual on their care (the 2011 Dilnot Commission on funding and social care suggested an upper limit of £35,000), and with the average dementia patient living for eight to 10 years, and annual care home costs between £59,000 to £73,000, selling the family home is often the only option for families pushed to the brink.“It’s a ticking time bomb,” Saunders, 49, says. “If someone was committing to it, that probably would sway my vote to that particular party, but this General Election is fast approaching, and I’m not seeing any evidence of that being on anyone’s agenda.”Saunders’s story will be familiar to anyone who has dealt with the disease up close. Having already endured the condition with one parent, Saunders, who works in the emergency services, quickly recognised what was happening to his mother, Audrey, when she forgot his birthday and began repeating questions in 2015, two years after his father’s death.Chris Saunders and his wife Nicola, both of whom had parents affected with dementia - Christopher PledgerStill, it took a year from Audrey’s first appointment to getting diagnosed with Alzheimer’s – after which the family was told to go into the next room, where someone from a charity handed them a leaflet. “And then you’re sent on your way, and that’s it really. You’ve got this diagnosis; this massive life-changing diagnosis – where do you go now? What help do we get?”While a cancer patient will receive their diagnosis along with a plan for NHS-funded next steps, there is no such roadmap for those with dementia – even though 40 per cent more of us, meaning 1.4 million people in total will be living with the condition in the UK by 2040, with an average care cost of £100,000.With local authorities instead of central government responsible for care provisions (almost two thirds of their budget is spent on adult and acute children’s social care), Saunders was left to battle labyrinthine council phone lines trying to track down the support they might be entitled to, which amounted to carers visiting Audrey a few times a day at her home.And then came the issue of a care home. When Audrey had a stroke in 2018, a meeting of healthcare workers determined that she needed to move into a home – news he and his wife, Nicola, welcomed, “because we were just broken,” he reflects.But while he sought support from Dementia UK, and hoped there would be some relief from life as “sandwich carers” for both their parents and child, finding somewhere for her to stay – and paying for it – quickly became a nightmare of its own. The decision had been reached on a Wednesday, “and the [hospital] wanted her out by the Friday, and that was left to me. No one was going to help me look. It was like, you’ve got two days, or we’ll just put her somewhere.”Saunders found a bed at a “middle-of-the-road” home nearby, at a monthly cost of £5,600. He was told that the local council would cover costs for the first 12 weeks, after which Saunders would need to repay that debt, and all those going forward – amounting to £67,000 per year, double the median salary in England. There was no option but to sell his mother’s house in West Sussex, blitzing through 30 years of memories in order to try and complete the sale within the stipulated 12-week window. It sold for £380,000; when she died in February, the entire pot had been spent.While dementia overtook his parents’ lives, Saunders’s mother-in-law was diagnosed with cancer – with her options entirely different to those given to the rest of the family. “If you need residential care because you are incapacitated through cancer… the NHS will pay for your care. But with dementia, it’s such a lottery.”The Labour Party's manifesto announced that Sir Keir Starmer would 'create a National Care Service to deal with a ""sector [that] needs deep reform' - Geoff PughThe King’s Fund senior fellow Simon Bottery says that when it comes to social care any incoming party’s strategy must be twofold: “Put[ting] enough money into the system so that we can support the current system to provide a decent standard of care to the people that need it.” And, reforming it entirely, and upping the number of those who are able to receive help. “What we have to do is to stop them ending up paying catastrophic costs.”Kieran Osborne, managing director of Squiggle Consult, which provides advice on estate planning, says that “people are definitely worried about losing the family home and the potential impact on inheritance. It’s one of the biggest concerns I hear from families.” Due to “deliberate deprivation” legislation, giving away your home or setting up a trust to pre-empt or sidestep care costs are unlawful; he advises that setting up power of attorney is the most prudent step, which usually takes around five months to register.Meanwhile, there appears to be an opportunity for any party that shows a genuine willingness to finally grasp the nettle of social care.

It’s work from home, pop into Whitehall a couple of days a week.”He added: “If you’re running a company and things are tight, you say to your managers and middle managers, ‘Right, I’m sorry, this is the way it is, you’ve got to cut £5 in £100’ – in fact in tough times it might be £10 in £100 or £20 in £100, and you have to find a way of doing that without affecting the product that we’re selling to the public.”Mr Farage added: “Some of these things we’re proposing are tough but, look, the accumulated national debt is now £2.7 trillion, it was just under £1 trillion when the Tories came to power, we simply cannot go on like this.Farage said the UK is ‘skint’ and in ‘real trouble’ (REUTERS)"

', 'What impact could tactical voting have on the 2024 General Election?']",Jabed Ahmed and Albert Toth,18 June 2024 at 7:31 am·7-min read,18,June,2024,07:31:00,7,"Britain will head to the polls on July 4 after prime minister Rishi Sunak called a snap general election at the end of May.June has seen intense vote-garnering efforts from all political parties as leaders chat, debate, and even paddle across the country to win over as many as possible. All parties have now revealed their election manifestos, laying out their vision for the country.Current polling would suggest things are not looking good for the Conservatives, with most trackers firmly putting Labour an average 20 points ahead of the governing party.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak during a visit to Cambridge Rugby Club in Cambridge (Joe Giddens/PA Wire)However, recent research by campaign group Best for Britain shows that 36 per cent of people are undecided in some constituencies. In more bad news for the government, the group has also identified 451 ‘tactical voting seats’ where voters have the best chance of ousting the Tories.Here’s everything you need to know about tactical voting and how important it could be in the upcoming general election:What is tactical voting?Tactical voting is when a voter casts their ballot for the candidate they believe is most likely to defeat another party’s candidate (usually the Conservatives), even if this candidate is not necessarily their first choice.Some see this as a necessary practice due to the UK’s ‘First Past The Post’ (FPTP) voting system. Under FPTP, it is the candidate who gets the most votes that wins.It may seem like the most democratic system to decide a winner at first glance, but many argue that FPTP does not always produce results that reflect the political leanings of the area.This is because some parties are much more politically aligned than others. For instance, in areas where the votes for Labour and the Liberal Democrats outweigh that for the Conservative candidate, but neither beat them alone, the Conservative candidate wins.Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer on the General Election campaign trail on Thursday (Gareth Fuller/PA Wire)However, the results would indicate that the majority of voters in this area support more progressive, left-wing or centre-left politicians.Groups such as the Electoral Reform Society (ERS) campaign to change this, pointing out that the MPs elected to parliament rarely reflect the popular vote.For instance, at the 2019 general election, 11.5 per cent of people voted for the Liberal Democrats, but they only secured 1.7 per cent of seats. The Conservatives’ 43.6 per cent, on the other hand, translated to 56.2 per cent of seats.The ERS promotes voting systems that are designed to tackle this issue, such as the Single Transferable Vote or Alternative Vote where voters can rank candidates by preference.However, in 2011 the UK was given a referendum on switching the way people vote to the Alternative Vote system, where the votes against it were nearly 68 per cent.Where has tactical voting been recommended?Ahead of polling day, campaign group Best for Britain has produced a list of tactical voting recommendations for voters who are keen to see the Tories ousted from government.The group recommends 451 candidates across the UK, around 70 per cent of MPs. These comprise 370 seats for Labour, 69 for the Lib Dems, seven for the SNP, three for the Greens and two for Plaid Cymru.Amongst the many seats targeted are those of Jacob Rees-Mogg (North East Somerset), Liz Truss (South West Norfolk) and Suella Braverman (Fareham and Waterlooville).If tactical voting was carried out according to their plan, Best for Britain project the Conservatives could wake up to as few as 45 seats on July 5, an astounding loss of 320. Meanwhile, Labour would take an average of 445, gaining 243.Does tactical voting work? Tactical voting could work, if it was carried out en masse. However, despite talk of tactical voting at most major elections, there is little evidence that it has made a significant impact in the past.There are many seats in the UK where a sustained tactical vote campaign would have changed the final result. For instance, in the 2023 Uxbridge by-election, the Conservatives secured 13,965 votes, while Labour secured 13,470.Meanwhile, the Greens gained 893 votes, coming in third. If all these votes were instead tactically given to Labour, it would have been a victory for the party in Boris Johnson’s former seat.It is a similar story for the seat of Somerset North East, held by Jacob Rees-Mogg since 2010. In 2019, Mr Rees-Mogg secured 28,360 votes, while Labour and the Lib Dems combined secured 26,053.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey (Joe Giddens/PA) (PA Wire)It is possible a combined effort could’ve secured the seat for either party, although neither has assented to a tactical voting pact in the past.However, the Lib Dems won the seat of Somerton and Frome for the first time since 2010 in last year’s by-election, with tactical voting thought to be a major factor. The Labour vote share had dwindled from 12.9 per cent in 2019, to just 2.6.“It is no secret that some Labour and Green party voters lent us their votes in Somerset and we are very grateful for their support,” said Lib Dem leader Ed Davey.“In many seats across the south-west, voters at the next election will be faced with a similar choice between the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives.”What impact could tactical voting have on the 2024 General Election?Polling experts have said an increase in tactical voting is “bad news for the Conservative Party”, but there may still be some three-way marginal seats between the Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems.Chris Hopkins, political research director at leading polling consultancy Savanta, told The Independent: ""Voters have got increasingly sophisticated in understanding how in a first past the post system, their vote can be as effective as possible.“In particular this is bad news for the Conservative Party, where there will be plenty of natural Labour supporters in the South West who will back the Lib Dems, as they know they are their best chance of getting rid of the Tories.""That being said, because of the forecasted size of the swing from Conservative to Labour, there are some three-way marginals where Labour and the Lib Dems may be unwilling to step aside. That could mean voters are told different things about who is 'most likely to win here', and could lead to split, enabling some Conservative MPs to hold on.""Prime Minister Rishi Sunak during a General Election campaign event at ExCeL London (Stefan Rousseau/PA) (PA Wire)Campaigners have also added tactical voting will help deliver a “progressive government”, but warned the first-past-the-post system (FPTP) must be changed to better represent voting intentions.Neal Lawson, executive director at Compass, told The Independent: “We desperately need a progressive government, and tactical voting will no doubt play a vital role in helping to deliver one - but voting tactically without conditions only entrenches the pendulum politics that grinds us all down and alienates voters from the political process.“The worry is that without a commitment to changing the system, tactical voting enshrines the abusive nature of First Past the Post and forces voters to continue voting tactically forever more.“If Labour does win the next election on the back of lent votes, they should commit to getting rid of FPTP and replacing it with a system that can better represent the progressive majority that already exists in this country.”Naomi Smith, CEO of Best for Britain and founder of tactical voting platform, GetVoting.org, said: “Our polling shows 13 million Brits are ready to vote tactically for change, and these voters will be key to a defeat that would keep the Tories out for a decade and the difference between deliverance or defeat for the likes of Rishi Sunak, Jeremy Hunt and Liz Truss.“Best for Britain will be helping voters get it right at GetVoting.org with expert constituency level insights and voting recommendations before polling day.”"
The Telegraph,"Theo Paphitis goes off-message as he invests time, but not cash, in Starmer",[],Tim Stanley,18 June 2024 at 8:19 am·3-min read,18,June,2024,08:19:00,3,"I’m not sure what I’m covering anymore. Is this an election, or an episode of The Prisoner?The scene: a Starmer-meets-real-people event at the Gabardine Bar in Basingstoke. It’s not a town Labour should be winning (majority 14,000). The Gabardine is not socialist territory (the window says “CHEESE & CHARCUTERIE”). Nor are there many real people about: just the bar staff, a couple of punters who came for a coffee and got trapped, and the press – hippos hungry for a story – who watch the window for signs of arrival.The leader appears on the high street. “He’s got Theo Paphitis with him!” An old lady stops the pair – you can’t plan for everything – and they chat briefly. I think I lip-read the words “...love you in Dragon’s Den”. Finally, they enter the charcuterie, Keir dressed head-to-toe in black, Theo in a shirt undone practically to the navel. Turn on a glitter ball and it’s a disco.Keir eats nothing, he drinks nothing. The owner complains about business being down, but from what I can see, Labour won’t help. “Country first,” says our next PM. “Clear plan for the future!” Then he addresses a semi-circle of TV cameras, shuffling from one t’other – BBC, ITV, twist, turn, evade – dodging bullets. The Telegraph asks if he agrees with Tony Blair that women have a vagina. He does, as do I – though if Tony says it, I find myself doubting it’s true.What the heck is happening? This is the apotheosis of Keir Starmer, he stands on the brink of the biggest majority in a century – and yet the public is going to vote for him having hardly met him, his campaign so tightly controlled a philosopher might say it never happened. In that black suit, he really does look like Patrick McGoohan in The Prisoner, running for election in a village populated by actors.I go rogue: let’s ask Theo a question. “Mr Paphitis,” I say, “would you invest in this man?”“Absolutely!” he laughs. Otherwise, “I wouldn’t be here”. But behind the laugh, I realise I’ve accidentally touched a nerve. Pressed on how much actual money he’s given to Labour, he replies “it might be zilch at the moment” – but he’s here with Keir and “action speaks louder than words”.Sir Keir and Mr Paphitis also visited a jewellery college in Basingstoke - Stefan Rousseau/PADoesn’t money speak louder still? “Well, does it?” he replies. “Lots of people just give money, I’ve given my time.” Hmm – that’s what I tell myself when I go to church and leave nothing on the donation plate.Was he ever a Conservative? Yes. Did he like Maggie? Indeed. So why not vote Tory? They’ve become self-obsessed and forgotten how to run the economy. Then a surprise, to him and to me: the other day “I found myself agreeing with Nigel Farage and I had to sit down and take a chill pill”. What about?! “He said Brexit didn’t fail, it is the government, the politicians who failed.” Around this point, Theo was gently led away by a staffer who felt he might enjoy talking to someone else, anyone else, perhaps the wall.As they say in showbiz: “Never work with children, animals or celebrities.”"
PA Media: UK News,Sunak: Tories can win General Election but people’s frustration ‘undeniable’,[],PA Political Staff,17 June 2024 at 11:23 am·5-min read,17,June,2024,11:23:00,5,"Rishi Sunak has insisted the Tories can still win the General Election after Cabinet minister Grant Shapps said a Conservative victory is unlikely.The Prime Minister said he understands people’s frustrations but gave a more optimistic assessment of his party’s chances than the Defence Secretary, who said that to claim the Tories are on course for a win would be to “try and pretend black is white”.As the party continues to languish behind Labour in the polls, he said Sir Keir Starmer lacked “the courage of his convictions” and suggested his rival would find the job in Downing Street “hard to do well”.Asked during a huddle with journalists on the Tory battlebus about what he thought of his political opponent, the Prime Minister said: “What I’d say is Keir Starmer is someone who clearly doesn’t have the courage of his convictions.“He also is not prioritising investment in our country’s security. I think that is deeply concerning as someone who’s sat in this job for 18 months, at a time when the world is more dangerous and uncertain than it’s been since the end of the Cold War, having just come back from the G7 and a peace summit about Ukraine in Switzerland.“It’s obvious that the world is incredibly dangerous and for someone who wants to be prime minister of our country not to prioritise investing more our country’s security I find deeply concerning.”Mr Sunak’s comments came as Nigel Farage launched Reform UK’s “contract” with voters to add to the Conservatives’ woes.Labour has an average 20-point poll lead over the past week – on 41% ahead of the Tories on 21% and Reform on 15%.Speaking during a visit to a Centrica gas rig earlier on Monday, the Prime Minister said: “There’s still two-and-a-half weeks to go in this election, I’m fighting hard for every vote because I believe we can win.“And there’s a very clear choice at this election: it’s having your taxes cut by the Conservatives or facing significant tax rises with the Labour Party.”(PA Graphics)Asked if he understands people’s frustrations with the Tory Party, with some voters deciding to turn to Reform UK, he replied: “Of course I understand people’s frustrations with that – I mean that’s undeniable, and I’ve been very clear that we have made progress, but there is more to go.“But the point now is we are on the right track and this election is about the future.”Mr Shapps earlier told Times Radio it is “possible to win the election”, but conceded it is “not the most likely outcome”, adding: “I’m a realist.”Asked if a Tory victory is unlikely, he replied: “I think that’s the realistic position, isn’t it? I mean, I live in the real world. So, you know, let’s not try and pretend black is white.”Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer and shadow chancellor Rachel Reeve on a visit to Southampton (Stefan Rousseau/PA)Meanwhile, Labour accused Jeremy Hunt of “admitting” pledges in the Conservative manifesto are “completely unfunded” after the BBC reported the Chancellor last week said that promised tax cuts would be funded by savings from a back-to-work programme announced in the autumn statement.In a sign of the campaign intensifying as it enters its fourth week, shadow paymaster general Jonathan Ashworth put a copy of the Tory document into a shredder at a hastily arranged press conference in London, claiming that is what Mr Hunt had done to the Conservatives’ economic credibility.The Tories have set out plans for billions in tax cuts, which they claim would be paid for by £12 billion of savings on welfare.Mr Sunak’s visit to a Centrica platform in the North Sea came as Mr Farage was setting out Reform’s plans – which he suggested were the first step on the path to a potential election win in 2029.Mr Farage added: “Our ambition is to establish a bridgehead in Parliament, and to become a real opposition to a Labour government.”He said the Tories would not be able to provide opposition because “they spend most of their days arguing among themselves, and they’re split down the middle when it comes to policy”.In other developments:– Reform set out a four-point plan for immigration including: leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, allowing zero illegal immigrants to settle in the UK, establishing a new “Department of Immigration” and returning migrants who come over in boats to France.– Labour claimed Chancellor Jeremy Hunt had driven a “coach and horses” through the Tory’s manifesto promises by saying that a £12 billion squeeze on welfare which the Conservatives plan to use to fund tax cuts had already been announced and factored in to the existing government finances.– Scotland’s First Minister John Swinney said the SNP will include a social tariff on energy, broadband and mobile bills in its manifesto this week.Labour intends to spend the week focusing on its plans for the economy, with shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves joining Sir Keir on the campaign trail.Sir Keir used a visit to a port in Southampton to say that a renegotiated Brexit deal could remove “an inhibitor” to economic growth.Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves and shadow secretary of state for business and trade Jonathan Reynolds met business leaders on Monday morning at the start of a campaign week focusing on the economy (Lucy North/PA)He said: “We took a decision to leave the EU, so we are not going to go back in. But we think the deal we’ve got is botched, it’s not good enough and I think many businesses would say: ‘We need something that works better for us.'”Ms Reeves used a Financial Times interview to suggest she would seek to revise parts of Boris Johnson’s 2020 Brexit deal by seeking closer alignment with EU rules in the chemicals and veterinary sectors, better touring rights for UK artists, and greater mutual recognition of qualifications for financial services workers.The Labour frontbencher also pledged to “hit the ground running to show that Britain is open for business” by holding a global investment summit in the first 100 days of entering government.She met members of her British infrastructure council on Monday morning to discuss attracting foreign investors who have been put off by political instability in the UK."

Email amy-clare.martin@independent.co.ukThe actress told The Independent: “I’m alarmed by the lack of attention given to the rising tide of knife crime during this election campaign. Since my brother Ben’s tragic murder in 2008, over 1,000 teenagers have lost their lives, and the numbers keep climbing – an 81% increase in knife crime in the last decade.“All evidence suggests this will worsen. Our Trust’s recent survey revealed a worrying trend: 1 in 4 young people believe carrying a knife offers protection.“Loopholes in legislation and lax online age verification make it shockingly easy to acquire dangerous knives. Unsanctioned violent content on social media further exposes young minds to knife crime. The age of knife carriers is dropping too.“With a heavy heart, I fear more families will suffer our loss unless this issue is tackled urgently.

Surely that says an awful lot about where we are.“There’s a litany of failures in relation to knife crime and it’s frustrating for me that it’s not part of the debate and the focus is not on the safety of children.“Knife crime hasn’t been dominant in terms of the election debate so far.

With crime it is almost as if we have become immune to it and we have run out of ideas.”He said the recent case involving two 12-year-old killers “beggars belief”.Figures show offences involving a knife or sharp instrument increased by seven per cent last year – with 49,489 recorded by police between January and December 2023.This was up from 46,153 in 2022, but three per cent lower than pre-Covid pandemic levels.Rishi Sunak has promised to recruit 8,000 extra police officers.In Labour’s manifesto, published on Thursday, Sir Keir Starmer vowed to halve knife crime in a decade.

The Telegraph,Starmer suggests savers aren’t ‘working people’,[],Nick Gutteridge,18 June 2024 at 5:43 am·3-min read,18,June,2024,05:43:00,3,"Sir Keir Starmer has said he will not increase the tax burden on 'working people' - Stefan Rousseau/PASir Keir Starmer has opened the door to tax rises for millions of Britons by defining a working person as someone who relies on public services and does not have savings.The Labour leader has repeatedly ruled out putting up taxes on “working people”, who he says have borne the brunt of the cost of living crisis.Asked what he meant by the term, he said it referred to “people who earn their living, rely on our services and don’t really have the ability to write a cheque when they get into trouble”.The definition means millions of Britons, including pensioners, savers and those who use private services such as healthcare, may not be covered by his tax rise pledge.Senior Tories claimed the remarks showed that Sir Keir was preparing to “wallop” savers and homeowners with tax rises, warning them to “be very afraid”.Labour has promised not to raise rates of income tax, national insurance or VAT for at least five years if it wins power, but has refused to rule out other tax rises.Sir Keir would not rule out an increase in council tax on Tuesday, saying that he could not “sit here two weeks before the election and write the budgets for the next five years”.But he said he had been “really clear we’re not going to be raising tax on working people” and that “none of our plans require tax rises over and above the ones we’ve set out”.Asked what he meant by working people, he sai: “The person I have in my mind when I say working people is people who earn their living, rely on our services and don’t really have the ability to write a cheque when they get into trouble.“So the sort of people I’m meeting pretty well every day now. It’s quite a big group, because these days there are many people obviously not so well-off.”He gave the example of a woman he had met in Southampton who has “got one job, she’s trying to get another job, and the bills are still bearing down on her”.Sir Iain Duncan Smith, a former Tory leader, said: “How unbelievable to say those who generate wealth, who work hard, who are successful, who add huge value to the British economy, to dismiss them completely.“They are his targets for higher taxation. If you have savings, if you own a home, if you own wealth, you are going to get walloped. That is a big admission. His levelling up isn’t levelling up, it’s levelling down. The old socialist in there who supported Jeremy Corbyn is still alive and well.”Sir Iain Duncan Smith said Sir Keir Starmer had made 'a big admission' - Carl Court/GettyThere are 11 million working-age people in Britain who have less than £1,000 in savings according to a recent Resolution Foundation report. That is typically considered to be the minimum “rainy day” contingency fund needed to cover unexpected costs that may crop up in life.But that still means two in three working households do have what could be considered sufficient savings to not qualify as “working people” under Sir Keir’s definition.On top of that, one in eight Britons now relies on private health insurance, according to a survey carried out by pollsters YouGov last year.The parents of 615,000 children who are privately educated are already facing having to fork out thousands more when VAT is applied to private school fees, while 12.5 million retirees, on the current trajectory, face being taxed on the state pension for the first time from 2027.Sir Keir’s comments also imply that people who own substantial assets, such as the 2.8 million landlords in the UK, would also not be considered working people."
