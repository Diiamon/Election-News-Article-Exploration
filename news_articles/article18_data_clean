The Telegraph,"North Sea oil and gas industry not safe with Labour, Sunak to claim",[],Daniel Sanderson,23 June 2024 at 5:00 pm·4-min read,23,June,2024,05:00:00,4,"Rishi Sunak will today accuse Labour of “virtue signalling to eco zealots” instead of protecting North Sea oil and gas jobs.The Prime Minister will visit Edinburgh on Monday to launch the Scottish Tory manifesto and will claim that Sir Keir Starmer would tax the vital UK energy sector “into oblivion” while attacking Labour’s “ideological” plans to ban new licences.In contrast, he is to pledge that a Tory government would introduce new legislation to guarantee that there would be further annual oil and gas licensing rounds and promise to maintain tax breaks for investment by energy companies.Mr Sunak will warn voters that the UK’s “North Sea industry isn’t safe with Labour” and pledge that a government he leads would “always stand full square behind Scotland’s North Sea oil and gas industry.”“We are committed to new licences, more investment in infrastructure and skills, and energy security for our country,” Mr Sunak is expected to say. We will deliver a secure future for the North Sea industry and the workers it employs.“Labour want to stop all new licences in the North Sea from day one of a Labour Government. Keir Starmer and Ed Miliband want to tax the UK’s oil and gas sector and the 100,000 Scottish jobs it supports into oblivion.“Labour don’t want to ban oil and gas, just British oil and gas. They would rather virtue signal to eco zealots than protect jobs here at home.”The Gannet - an installation owned and operated by Shell UK in the North Sea - Julian Walters/Adobe StockLabour’s manifesto states that the party would “not issue new licences to explore new fields”.Sir Keir has also vowed to double down on a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, closing “loopholes” in it, increasing it by three points to 78 per cent, and extending it until 2029.The industry has warned that Labour’s plan will deter investment and risks leading to the loss of up to 100,000 jobs, with the Tories warning the proposals would spell “disaster for Scotland”.The SNP is also refusing to commit to supporting new drilling, with John Swinney rejecting calls to abandon Nicola Sturgeon’s “presumption” against further licences and branding Mr Sunak a “climate denier”.Mr Sunak will launch the Scottish Tory manifesto alongside Douglas Ross, the outgoing Scottish Tory leader.While opinion polls suggest the Conservatives are heading for a heavy defeat UK-wide, the party is still hopeful that it can hold on to the six Scottish seats it won in 2019. Three are in the north-east of Scotland in areas heavily dependent on the North Sea.The Scottish Tory manifesto will also include proposals to push ahead with a new nuclear power station in Scotland, despite SNP opposition, increase financial support for Scottish farmers and press for permanent removal of tariffs on Scotch whisky from the US government.Mr Ross admitted on Sunday that the constituency he is standing in, Aberdeenshire North and Moray East, was on a “knife edge”.The SNP is hoping a row that saw Mr Ross replace incumbent David Duguid, who had been hospitalised due to a serious spinal condition, as the Tory candidate will help the nationalists claim the seat.However, Mr Sunak will urge Scottish voters to “send the nationalists the strongest message possible that the people of Scotland want to move on from their independence obsession”.He is set to attack the SNP’s record on tax, promising to cut levies on workers after the SNP increased them.He will say: “It tells you everything you need to know that while the SNP are turning Scotland into the high tax capital of the UK, hiking taxes at every opportunity, this Conservative Government is cutting tax for workers here in Scotland and across the United Kingdom.“We’ve already cut taxes by £900 for the average worker by reducing the National Insurance tax. And if you offer us your support in this election, we will cut this tax again.”During a visit to a Scottish wind farm on Monday, Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, will claim Labour’s energy plans would “turbocharge” the Scottish economy.The party has claimed its windfall tax will help pay for investment in green energy projects and pay for GB Energy, a publicly-owned energy company which will make targeted investments.Alison Thewliss, the SNP candidate for Glasgow North, said: “It’s good that Rishi Sunak and Douglas Ross will get time tomorrow to compare notes on which one has run the worst campaign. They are both on their last legs as leaders, their party is already finished in this campaign and the real choice for Scotland in this election is who is now best placed to put Scotland’s interests first.”"
HuffPost UK,The Tory Betting Scandal Presented Rishi Sunak With An Opportunity To Look Strong - He Blew It,[],Kevin Schofield,23 June 2024 at 10:01 am·3-min read,23,June,2024,10:01:00,3,"Rishi Sunak Leon Neal via Getty ImagesThey say that bad things come in threes. If only Rishi Sunak was that lucky.Ever since he called the election on May 22, the prime minister has been hit by a litany of misfortune - some self-inflicted - which has completely derailed the Tories’ election campaign.The latest - and possibly most damaging - one is the revelation that senior Tories close to the prime minister are accused of placing bets on the date of the election.Two of them are Conservative candidates, one of whom - former Sunak parliamentary aide Craig Williams - has admitted he did it.The Tories’ chief data officer, Nick Mason, and campaign director Tony Lee have each taken a “leave of absence” after also being accused.The other alleged punter we currently know about is one of the PM’s close protection officers, or at least he was until he was suspended from duty by the Metropolitan Police.It is the force’s different approach to disciplinary matters which have led to Sunak facing fresh accusations that he is weak, a label already attached to the prime minister by 61% of the public.Labour’s Jonathan Ashworth said: “Sunak promised integrity, professionalism and accountability, instead his weakness means he has overseen the same levels of sleaze and scandal that have come to epitomise the last 14 years of Tory government.“Rishi Sunak needs to take immediate action against all implicated.”Home secretary James Cleverly endured a tough grilling from Trevor Phillips on Sky News this morning over the PM’s apparent inaction.“Why doesn’t he, like any other employer might do in this situation, call in the alleged offenders, ask them ‘did you place a bet or did you not place a bet’ and if the answer is yes, sack them?” Phillips asked.After Cleverly claimed No.10′s hands are tied while the Gambling Commission investigates, Phillips told him: “No, no, no - he’s the prime minister. These people work for him. He can do whatever he wants.“If it were you, he’d say ‘James, tell me the truth. Did you or did you not?’. And you, being an honest man, would say yes or no.”The minister said: “I don’t necessarily know the process in detail, but the Gambling Commission is the appropriate body for this. They have said they’re investigating and they’ve also said it is inappropriate for us to comment on what is a live investigation.”But Phillips hit back: “He’s the prime minister - he doesn’t get told what to do by the Gambling Commission.”""Why doesn't he just do something about it? He is the boss.""@TrevorPTweets asks Home Secretary @JamesCleverly why the prime minister hasn't sacked those involved in the gambling scandal.#TrevorPhillipshttps://t.co/xItZsH7tea📺 Sky 501, Virgin 602, Freeview 233, YouTube pic.twitter.com/T9KXqDJX1j— Sky News (@SkyNews) June 23, 2024For his part, Sunak has said the affair has left him “very angry” and has pledged that any Tories found guilty will be booted out of the party.However, regardless of the reason for Sunak’s unwillingness to take action now, the impression it has given is of a prime minister at the mercy of events rather than taking charge of them.With less than two weeks to go until election day, the Tory betting scandal has merely confirmed their impression of a PM who can’t take the big decisions, which is one of many reasons why time is fast running out on his period in office.Related...'A Sign Of Moral Decay': Trevor Phillips Clashes With James Cleverly Over Top Tories Betting On Election DateWhy The Betting Scandal Engulfing The Tory Election Campaign Is Such A Big DealPressure Mounts On Rishi Sunak As Tory Betting Scandal Deepens"
Yahoo News UK,"Who is Richard Tice? Reform’s former leader turned Farage sidekickThe candidate for Hartlepool has seen his party's popularity swell in recent months, with one poll showing reform ahead of the Conservatives.",[],Andrew Naughtie,Updated 14 June 2024 at 6:45 am·6-min read,14,June,2024,06:45:00,6,"Now that Nigel Farage has taken over as the leader of Reform UK, Richard Tice’s public profile is fading fast - but the Reform chairman remains involved in the party's operations.So far, the party has only one MP, Conservative defector Lee Anderson. But a recent poll has shown Reform overtaking the Tories, raising the possibility Anderson could hold his seat and even end up with fellow Reformers in the next Parliament.As the candidate for Hartlepool, where he stood as the Brexit Party candidate in 2019, Tice hopes to be one of them. So who is he, and what does he stand for?Childhood and educationBorn in Surrey in 1964 to James Tice, a showjumper, and Joan Tice, a horse trainer. Educated at the private boarding school Uppingham, he studied at the University of Salford, gaining a degree in construction economics and quantity surveying – teeing him up for a career that he said would ""continue the family genes in the property industry"".Family (partner & kids)Tice has three children from a 24-year marriage that ended in divorce. He is now in a long-term relationship with the right-wing writer and journalist Isabel Oakeshott.She is perhaps best known for two notorious incidents that set her against leading Tories: a book that featured the heavily disputed allegation that David Cameron had engaged in sexual activity with a pig, and the release of embarrassing messages entrusted to her by Matt Hancock when she agreed to write a book with him.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election? Full list mappedThe key issues that will decide the electionWhen is the first UK general election TV debate?What is purdah? The strict rule that governs what politicians can and can't sayNet worthWhile not quite in the same league as Rishi Sunak, Tice is one of the wealthiest people in British politics. As he describes it on his website, he made his multi-million-pound fortune over the course of “30 years of making things happen in property investment”, starting with a graduate job at a London firm in 1987.According to Tice, the company he leads as CEO, Quidnet Capital, has “bought and managed £500 million in commercial properties across the UK on behalf of clients”.He was also a key figure in the redevelopment of London’s Nine Elms district, near Battersea Power Station, a controversial project that has transformed a stretch of the Thames’s south bank with a welter of rapidly erected high-rise blocks.GB News linksAlong with Nigel Farage, Lee Anderson and several MPs on the right flank of the Tory party, Tice is a regular on the hard-right, culture war-focused TV outlet GB News. There he hosts a programme called “Richard Tice’s Sunday Sermon”, which serves as a platform for him to deliver his political analysis without the interruptions of an interviewer.However, despite the network being a relatively safe space for him in ideological terms, Tice’s appearances aren’t always amicable. A recent interview with host Andrew Pierce, a longtime right-wing commentator, saw him challenged fiercely about Reform’s chances in a summer election should one be called – with Pierce pointing to the “weirdos” selected by the party to fight numerous seats as evidence the party is “not ready”.Richard Tice, pictured in 2018 at a 'Leave Means Leave' campaign event, is focused on the issue of immigration. (Steve Finn/WENN)Tice was also involved in an incident that saw the network deemed in breach of broadcasting regulator Ofcom’s impartiality regulations, specifically an interview in which a former Brexit Party MEP failed to “sufficiently challenge” his views on immigration.The regulator is under increasing pressure to crack down on GB News heading into the election, with critics arguing it cannot be allowed to broadcast shows that feature Tory and Reform MPs interviewing each other without alternative points of view represented.Tice on NHSThe state and future of the NHS set to be one of this election’s main battlegrounds, and Reform’s key health policy is to spend £17 billion on the NHS on top of its current budget in an effort to get waiting lists down to zero. It also proposes introducing tax relief on private healthcare – something that has been criticised by opponents as a creeping step towards the privatisation of healthcare writ large.Tice’s stated rationale is that the reason the service is struggling is because the money it needs is being spent on other things that the public do not in fact support. Top of the list is Net Zero, which the party and its predecessors have long decried as a pointless “woke” project.In April, Tice used a press conference to frame the choice starkly. “We have a choice in this country, it seems to me,” he said. “A pretty clear choice. Do we want zero waiting lists in two years, and to keep them there? That is the Reform choice. Or do we want net zero CO2 emissions in 25 years? That is the Labour choice.”Tice on immigrationImmigration is by far Reform UK’s top issue, with the party looking to build on Farage’s two decades of campaigning against it in its legal and illegal forms.As far as the election goes, Tice and the party are targeting the continuing arrival of small boats of people travelling across the English Channel, many of them seeking asylum. He has criticised the government for failing to stop “mass immigration” post-Brexit, and described Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda policy as “a disaster”, arguing on GB News that its supposed deterrent value was revealed to be zero just hours after the House of Commons finally passed the law.Reform chairman Richard Tice (L) and leader Nigel Farage speak at the party's economic policy launch at Church House in London. (Alamy Live News)“Within a matter of hours more boats, absolutely packed full, overfilled with illegal migrants, were setting off from the beaches. And we learnt on Tuesday morning that sadly five people, including a young child, drowned leaving the beaches. That's not a deterrent. That's an absolute disaster.”Instead of deporting people to Rwanda, he is arguing for a “pick up and take back” policy that would see small boat arrivals deposited back on French soil. As evidence that this is both practical and humane, he has cited similar policies deployed in the US and Australia.However, he has not addressed the fact that Australia’s policy has been criticised internationally for leaving so-called “boat people” confined to facilities on the island of Nauru, where there have been incidents of suicide and self-immolation.Tice on cost of living crisisPerhaps unsurprisingly given he is trying to peel away former Tory voters, Tice has criticised recent Tory prime ministers harshly for overseeing Britain’s intense cost of living crisis. In 2022, he accused then-prime minister Boris Johnson of “waffling” over the situation. “Clueless, out of touch, no ideas, no help,” he tweeted. “Shocking.”He has also warned that the prospect of a “disastrous” Labour government will offer no prospect of meaningful relief for struggling households.Instead, Reform proposes lifting the minimum level of income tax to £20,000 while cutting various other taxes – among them fuel duty, another gesture to the party’s rejection of environmentalism as a top priority."
The Telegraph,"Put Tory ‘star’ Boris Johnson on campaign trail, says Robert Jenrick",[],Genevieve Holl-Allen,23 June 2024 at 10:50 am·3-min read,23,June,2024,10:50:00,3,"Boris Johnson should be allowed on the campaign trail, Robert Jenrick has said, describing the former prime minister as a “star” of the Conservative movement.The former immigration minister said that Mr Johnson had paid a “heavy price for what happened in the past” and that he should be brought back into the fold.Appearing on Sky’s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips, he said: “Boris is one of the stars of the Conservative movement.“He’s a brilliant campaigner, a superb Conservative politician and I think at this moment the whole Conservative family needs to unite. We need to rally together.“I know that Boris has been campaigning and supporting and providing endorsements to Conservative candidates. I think that’s great and I want to see him welcomed and encouraged to do more in this campaign, and in fact in the future.”The former prime minister has produced a series of video endorsements for Tories standing for re-election, and has offered support from any former Tory MP standing who wants it.On the weekend Mr Jenrick wrote in the Mail on Sunday that Mr Johnson “must always have a place in the Conservative Party, including in Parliament, if he ever wishes to have one”.Robert Jenrick is seen as a possible Tory leadership hopeful if he holds onto his seat in Newark, Notts - Victoria Jones/paThe ex-minister’s intervention will trigger further speculation as to the future of the Conservative Party after July 4, if their loss is as significant as polls predict.Mr Jenrick also called on voters considering backing Reform UK on July 4 to stick with the Tories, calling the Conservative Party “the natural home for Reform voters”.He wrote: “We have to build a coalition of voters and propose policies which will fix people’s problems – be that on migration, public services reform, the cost of living or housing.”He added: “While I vehemently disagree with Nigel Farage that the West provoked Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine, I have a lot of respect for him.”Mr Jenrick is seen as a possible Tory leadership hopeful if he holds onto his seat in Newark, Nottinghamshire on July 4, along with Kemi Badenoch and Tom Tugendhat.He quit his ministerial role in December 2023 over the Rwanda Bill, saying that the legislation “does not go far enough”.He told Sky News: “It’s no secret that I’ve had disagreements with the current Government. I resigned after all from the Cabinet over immigration.“But I do believe that we face a moment of peril now because the choice at this election is between the Conservatives who do believe in lower taxes, in secure borders, in controlling and reducing migration.“And of course, I know that there is anger and frustration in the country about some of those issues, and I want the party to be stronger on those.”"
The Guardian,Pressure on Rishi Sunak as election betting scandal grows,[],Eleni Courea and Matthew Weaver,23 June 2024 at 2:33 pm·6-min read,23,June,2024,02:33:00,6,"Rishi Sunak is facing a growing clamour to come clean about the betting scandal engulfing Westminster after a fifth figure was drawn into the row.Senior Conservatives were among those calling for candidates and officials to be suspended pending the result of investigations, while the prime minister was urged to get a grip on the drip-drip of revelations.Labour wrote to the head of the Gambling Commission on Sunday evening urging the watchdog to name those it has placed under investigation “in the public interest”, warning that “ongoing speculation … is casting a shadow over the election”.The scandal has escalated since the Guardian revealed nearly two weeks ago that Craig Williams, who was Sunak’s closest parliamentary aide, is being investigated by the watchdog for betting £100 on a July election three days before Sunak surprised the country by naming the date.Related: Betting scandal as bad for Tories as Partygate, says Michael GoveAfter being approached for comment by this newspaper, Williams said he “put a flutter on the general election some weeks ago” and the following day said he had made a “huge error of judgment”.Five people linked to Sunak or the Conservatives have been identified as being part of the watchdog’s inquiries so far. They include Williams; the Tory candidate Laura Saunders and her husband, Tony Lee, who is the party’s campaign director; and Nick Mason, the party’s data officer.An unnamed Metropolitan police officer who is part of Sunak’s close protection security team has also been arrested in connection with the inquiry into bets placed on a July election.The Sunday Times reported this weekend that Mason had made several dozen bets before Sunak announced the 4 July date, each of which was worth less than £100 but which would have brought cumulative winnings of thousands of pounds. A spokesperson for Mason said it would be inappropriate to comment during an investigation but that he denied wrongdoing.The Met officer was arrested on 17 June after the force was contacted by the Gambling Commission. He is the only person to have faced disciplinary action so far, although Lee and Mason have both taken a leave of absence from their roles.Pat McFadden, Labour’s national campaign coordinator, urged the commission’s chief executive, Andrew Rhodes, to “make available the widest possible information about how wide the circle spreads”.In a letter to Rhodes, McFadden said it was “in the public interest that the Gambling Commission makes public the names of other figures you are investigating”.A gambling industry source said hundreds of bets on a July election were referred to the watchdog across the sector after the Guardian’s revelations about Williams, but “very few” of those were by people flagged as being “politically exposed”.Related: Who are the five being investigated over UK election date betting scandal?There were reports on Sunday that the watchdog is investigating other individuals linked to the Conservative party or government.Sunak is under pressure to formally suspend Lee and Mason and to withdraw support from Williams and Saunders, who would be Conservative MPs if elected.Robert Buckland, the former justice secretary, told LBC on Sunday: “Where you’ve got a police officer who’s been suspended, I think consistency should apply here.“You’ve got employees and I’m sure there’s a mechanism which could allow their suspension, you’ve got candidates on the ballot paper – so it may be a matter for the whip to look at it once they’ve been elected and whether they take the Conservative whip, that might be a way to enforce discipline once elected.”Anne Milton, a former Conservative MP and party whip, told Times Radio: “It confirms views about the fact that the Conservative party hasn’t upheld standards in public life. It’s not behaved well. There appears to be no leadership from the top.“Suspension is the right thing to do while people are investigated. It’s harsh on people, if the allegations are found not to be true, but that is what would happen in any other sphere of work.”Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the committee standards of public life, said the prime minister should be taking tougher action. He told the Guardian: “It’s right that he should because so far he has shown a lack of leadership. He keeps saying he’s very angry about it and doesn’t do anything. I would think that a minimum was to suspend them from their official roles in the Conservative party.”In the Rochdale byelection earlier this year, Labour disowned its candidate over comments he had made about Israel and Jewish people. “I would have thought that it was similarly relevant for the Conservative party to do the same,” Graham said.James Cleverly, the home secretary, told Sky on Sunday that he was “not in any way going to defend people who placed bets” but insisted it was only a “small number of individuals”.Related: UK election betting scandal: all you need to know about the world of political wagersMichael Gove, the levelling up secretary, compared the row with the Partygate scandal. “It looks like one rule for them and one rule for us … That’s the most potentially damaging thing. The perception that we operate outside the rules that we set for others. That was damaging at the time of Partygate and is damaging here,” he said in an interview.Sunak said last week he was “incredibly angry” about the allegations and that anyone who had broken the rules “should not only face the full consequences of the law but I will ensure that they are booted out of the Conservative party too”.The Liberal Democrats called on Sunak to launch a Cabinet Office inquiry into the reports. Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: “This is now an all-out scandal at the heart of Rishi Sunak’s Conservative party.”George Osborne, the former Conservative chancellor, told his Political Currency podcast earlier this month that about 40 people knew the date of the election in advance.The Conservative party would not be drawn on whether more of its officials or candidates were under investigation. A spokesperson said: “As instructed by the Gambling Commission, we are not permitted to discuss any matters related to any investigation with the subject or any other persons.”A Gambling Commission spokesperson said: “Currently the commission is investigating the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election. This is an ongoing investigation, and the commission cannot provide any further details at this time. We are not confirming or denying the identity of any individuals involved in this investigation.”"

The polls have consistently painted a very bleak picture for the prime minister, with Labour holding on to a double-digit poll lead over his Conservatives.Recent by-election results suggest that Labour is likely to win a landslide victory – but there’s still time for the PM to turn it around.Here’s everything you need to know about Sunak and what’s he’s saying about the biggest issues in British politics right now.Early lifeSunak was born in Southampton in 1980, the eldest of three children. His Indian parents both arrived from East Africa in the 1960s. A football-mad boy whose childhood idol was Matt Le Tissier, Sunak was described by the family’s neighbours as a child with “lovely manners”.In his youngest years, the PM attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. According to a recent biography, fellow pupil Ollie Case said: “He was someone that was talked about. The teachers would say: ‘He’s going to be prime minister'.""But, growing up in the 1980s and 90s, he also remembers experiencing racism. “My mother was obsessed with us not having accents,” Sunak has said.Rishi Sunak was football-mad as a boy growing up in Southampton. (ITV)Sunak's familySunak is married to Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian entrepreneur and multi-billionaire. The pair first met in 2004 at Stanford University, his future wife apparently attracted to his “honesty and integrity”.Five years later they married in a two-day Indian wedding held in Bangalore. The couple have two daughters, Krishna and Anoushka, who will turn 13 and 11 this year, both of whom are largely kept out of the public eye.Sunak attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. (Rishi Sunak, Instagram)His parentsYashvir Sunak, Rishi’s father, was born in Kenya. He arrived in the UK to study medicine and then stayed, becoming an NHS GP. His mother, Usha, was born in Tanzania and is a pharmacist.The couple met in Britain and settled in Southampton in the 1970s. Usha is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.His educationAs a teenager Sunak studied at Winchester College where he was, he says, a self-confessed “geek”. According to a recent biography, the “naughtiest” thing the prime minister did during his school days “was to smuggle a hand-held television into the school so that he did not miss any key games of Euro 96”.The childhood home of Rishi Sunak in Southampton. (Getty Images, photo taken in 2022)Perhaps unsurprisingly for someone with such an unblemished record, he went on to become the school’s head boy. Sunak worked while studying, delivering medicines for his mother’s pharmacy and as a waiter at a local Indian restaurant.After school, Sunk read philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, graduating in 2001 with a first class degree. While still at university he held an internship at the Conservative Party campaign headquarters and joined the party, but went on studying before entering politics.He earned his MBA from Stanford in 2006 as a Fulbright Scholar, meaning he was selected among the most promising candidates from the UK.How much is he worth?As prime minister, Rishi Sunak earns £80,807 on top of a salary of £84,144 for being an MP. But his current income from Westminster pales in comparison to his family’s vast wealth through marriage.The Sunday Times valued the couple’s joint fortune at £730m. Murty's father is the co-founder of Infosys, an Indian tech conglomerate, in which she holds shares estimated at around £430m. Her family is also involved in a £900m business arrangement with Amazon in India, and she is a shareholder of multiple other companies.Rishi Sunak's mother is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.Before entering politics Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and a series of hedge funds. He is also known to have invested in blind trusts, in which investments are made without holders knowing where the funds are located. These arrangements reportedly hold Sunak’s own multi-million-pound fortune.His religionSunak is not only the first prime minister of colour and of Indian heritage but he is also the first practising Hindu to hold the biggest job in UK politics.He has spoken of his pride in his Hindu faith, saying, “that’s how I was raised, and that’s how I am”. He said: “Having faith gives you resilience, gives you strength that is important and it provides an outlook on life which I find particularly valuable.”Sunak on... the NHSThe prime minister’s biggest challenge in office has been the crisis in the NHS - and to many people in the sector his government has been found wanting. “We have not made enough progress,” Sunak said when asked about his commitment to cut NHS waiting lists during an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV. Asked if that meant he had failed, the prime minister replied: “Yes, we have.""Sunak expects to see waiting lists start to reduce this spring, and blames the delays on “industrial action”, as disputes with junior doctors and consultants over pay and conditions continue. Yet Sunak himself has been blamed for holding up a deal that would prevent more walkouts.Sunak, his wife Akshata and daughters Anoushka and Krishna (second left) at Santa Monica Pier, California, on their summer holiday in 2023. (AP)Sunak on… immigrationAccording to the prime minister, illegal migration threatens to “overwhelm” Europe. In June 2023 he claimed his plan to “stop the boats” and tackle illegal immigration was working, but by August 2023 he had changed his mind: “It’s not an easy problem to fix,” he told broadcasters. “I never said we would be able to solve it overnight.”He has staked much of his reputation on the government's Rwanda Bill - his plan to deport asylum seekers to the east African country that finally became law last month, after months of legal and procedural challenges. It has paved the way for deportation flights to get off the ground within weeks.He described his policy, which he says will act as a deterrent to people traffickers, as being “the will of the people” – yet polling suggests low support for such a punitive approach.The policy, coupled with Conservative talk of limits on legal migration, shows that the government is committed to taking a hard line on the issue, despite the risk of alienating more moderate voters.The Rwanda policy is not universally popular. (YouGov)Sunak on... the cost of living crisisThe prime minister has told hard-pressed working families that they will feel some relief from the cost of living crisis as inflation continues to drop following its highs of October 2022. He described the government’s tax cuts as “meaningful” and has welcomed the dip in mortgage rates at the turn of the year.Sunak says falling inflation will have the biggest impact on family budgets “and will start to ease some of those pressures” and that he was right to focus on that figure. However, the global drop in energy prices is probably the biggest factor in easing the hit on wallets - something that the prime minister has no control over.However, the fall in inflation to 2.3% on 22 May this year – the lowest it has been in nearly three years – was likely one of the key factors in persuading Sunak to call a snap election many weeks earlier than experts had predicted.Can we expect more handouts or tax breaks to help balance family budgets? Not according to Sunak, who has warned voters that it’s time to “move on” from government support.Sunak on... pensionsThe triple-lock pensions policy is a tricky one for Sunak – especially since Labour has committed to retaining the policy. Any change to a policy that has become a hallmark of recent Conservative governments would not go down well with the 12 million pensioners it would likely impact – many of whom are lifelong Tory voters.Last November, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said pensions should start being pegged to an average of inflation and wage growth, which would help reduce state spending over time.Sunak’s response to that was ambiguous to say the least: “We are the government that has … delivered the triple lock and it is why, right now, pensions are, depending on how you look at it, £800 or £900 bigger than they otherwise would have been.” He is yet to confirm whether it will appear in the manifesto."

He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""This is one poll - we’ve actually, I think, had four other polls published in the last 24 hours - none of which have had Reform ahead, not even all of which have had Reform gaining ground, but quite a couple of them certainly suggesting it’s also got very close.""He said it may not be the case that Reform are ahead - and could be on average four or five points behind. But he said: ""This is still bad news for the Conservatives. The only way Rishi Sunak can hope to get even to base camp in narrowing the lead that Labour have started off with this campaign was to squeeze the Reform vote.""He added: ""Rather than making progress, things are actually going backwards, not least of course because of Nigel Farage’s decision to fight this campaign.""With many speculating that Reform UK with Farage at the helm could ""beat"" the Tories, Yahoo News UK takes a look.What do the latest polls say?YouGov’s voting intention tracker, updated on Tuesday, suggests the Tories and Reform UK are neck and neck.With Labour well ahead on 38%, the Tories are trailing on 18% – compared to a high of 53% under Boris Johnson in 2020 – with Reform UK just behind on 17% and the Liberal Democrats on 15%.However, there are multiple polls taking place at any one time by a number of different companies.According to the PA news agency, an average of all polls that were carried out wholly or partly during the seven days to June 13 puts Labour on 43%, 21 points ahead of the Conservatives on 22%, followed by Reform on 14%, the Lib Dems on 10% and the Greens on 6%.And while Reform’s average is up one percentage point on the figure for the previous week and the Tories are down one point, there is still an eight-point gap, on average, between the two.Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?Unless something remarkable happens, in short: 'No' - and that's because of the first past the post (FPTP) voting system in which the candidate with the largest number of votes in their constituency is elected.According to the Electoral Reform Society, which is against FPTP, this system leads to a situation where “even if millions of voters support the same party, if they are thinly spread out across the UK they may only get the largest number of votes in a couple of these contests – so only win a few MPs"".“Tens of thousands of voters supporting a different party, but who live near each other, could end up with more MPs. This means the number of MPs a party has in parliament rarely matches their popularity with the public.”Rishi Sunak on the campaign trail on Wednesday. (AFP via Getty Images)Farage knows this well. As the leader of UKIP in the 2015 election, he saw his party win 12.6% of the nationwide vote and one seat. The Liberal Democrats won 7.9% of the vote... and eight seats.Indeed, YouGov last week released a poll – put together using the multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) surveying technique, from a sample size of nearly 60,000 respondents – which suggested the Tories would win just 140 seats, having won 365 in 2019. But this is still 140 more than the zero it projected Reform UK to win, in spite of its strong polling figures.The model had Reform UK ""performing strongly in a number of seats but still a long way off winning in any"", with projected second-placed finishes in 27 constituencies.YouGov's MRP projection. (YouGov)Granted, this model was formed between 24 May and 1 June, before Farage's headline-grabbing intervention on Monday last week in which he announced he would be standing as an MP.But, even as Reform UK polls closer than ever to the Tories, it's difficult to imagine the party winning more than a handful of seats.Chris Hopkins, director at polling firm Savanta, told Yahoo News UK that in one respect, Reform UK is at an advantage compared to Ukip in 2015 because ""Ukip took votes from both Labour and the Conservatives, and we are not seeing that with Reform UK – they are all coming from the Conservatives.""That is the consequence of Rishi Sunak making immigration a centrepiece of the campaign and failing to deliver on it. Even if you have voters that are neutral on immigration, they would say the small boats policy has been a disaster.""But even so, Hopkins said, Reform UK is still ""at a huge electoral disadvantage"" in that its votes are not very concentrated, they are very evenly spread.""There are going to be some races where Reform UK is strong - the Nigel Farage factor in Clacton is really interesting - but realistically its ceiling is five seats: and that’s a high ceiling.""Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey on a campaign visit in Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire, on Wednesday. (PA)Like Reform UK, Sir Ed Davey’s Liberal Democrats are performing well in the polls.In a sign of how defensive the Tory campaign is becoming, one online party advert claims voting for Reform UK or the Lib Dems could give Labour 100 extra seats, resulting in the biggest majority in its history.It depicts a scenario where the Conservatives are beaten into third place behind the Lib Dems, with just 57 seats, despite getting 19% of the vote and without Reform winning a single seat.Read more: Pollsters got it wrong in 2015, so could Labour’s lead be overestimated? (The Guardian)However, it remains unlikely the Lib Dems will finish second. YouGov’s MRP poll projected the party performing strongly, winning 48 seats. This would be up 37 from 2019, but still nowhere near the Tories’ projected 140.However, amid all this talk about projections, it’s worth remembering they are still only polls and not a definite indicator of how people will vote on 4 July. The 1992 and 2015 elections are notable examples of how polling didn’t match the end results of Tory wins.What is proportional representation?Proportional representation, as defined by the UK parliament, is an electoral system ""in which the distribution of seats corresponds closely with the proportion of the total votes cast for each party. For example, if a party gained 40% of the total votes, a perfectly proportional system would allow them to gain 40% of the seats.""This differs from the first past the post system, as set out above, in that a relatively high vote share rarely corresponds with increased seats for the smaller parties. In 2019, for example, the Lib Dems won 11.5% of the vote but only 1.7% – 11 – of the 650 seats.Unsurprisingly, both Reform UK and the Lib Dems support proportional representation.The Lib Dems this week made it part of their manifesto, with the party saying it would introduce the single transferrable vote method, a form of proportional representation which allows electors to rank their preference of candidates on the ballot.The party previously sought to change the UK’s voting system while in the coalition government under then-leader Nick Clegg, but voters rejected the plan in a 2011 referendum.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

Yahoo News UK,"3 electoral maps that show how disastrous the election could be for the ToriesWith new modelling predicting a Labour victory even bigger than Tony Blair's 1997 landslide, the outlook for Rishi Sunak is not looking good.",['Which Tory ministers are at risk of losing their seats?'],James Cheng-Morris and  James Hockaday,Updated 5 June 2024 at 8:34 am·4-min read,5,June,2024,08:34:00,4,"The outlook was already looking bleak for the Conservative Party when Rishi Sunak called the general election following months of dismal approval ratings that showed little sign of improving.At a campaign event last week, Sunak said he didn't think defeat to Labour was a ""foregone conclusion"", suggesting his main election rival Sir Keir Starmer was taking the British electorate ""for granted"".However, a general election projection released on Monday will have added to the Tories' woes – predicting the biggest win for Labour in the party's history, surpassing even that of Tony Blair's 1997 landslide.The analysis, carried out by YouGov for Sky News, used a relatively new polling technique called Multi-level Regression and Post-stratification (MRP), which is regarded to have had a good track record and can provide detailed predictions at a constituency level basis. The scale of Sunak's problems is demonstrated by the interactive maps below, showing just how much ground the Tories are expected to lose compared to their 2019 victory.Click on the arrows in the top left to switch between the two maps. Check your own constituency to see if it is projected to change handsThe first map above shows the seats won in the 2019 general election, when Boris Johnson led the party to a stunning majority.The wall of Tory blue on the map, compared to the spots of Labour red, is a demonstration of just how far Labour, then led by Jeremy Corbyn, had fallen in public standing. The result was Labour's worst electoral performance since 1935.If you toggle to the second map, the projection by YouGov (which was based on polling carried out between 24 May - 1 June) suggests that Starmer's party is on track to win 422 seats, with the Tories down to just 140.Such a result would be the Conservative Party's worst performance at a general election since 1906. If YouGov's predictions are accurate, Labour winning a 194-seat majority would be the highest number since Conservative Stanley Baldwin won a majority of 208 in 1924.The model suggests the Conservatives could be set for near wipeout across many areas of the country, including London, the North East, the North West, and Wales.It also projects that the Scottish National Party would lose more than half their seats, with Labour returning as the largest party north of the border, and the Liberal Democrats reclaiming its place as the third party of British politics – winning 48 seats.The new figures, released yesterday, came as Reform UK co-founder Nigel Farage announced that he would be returning as the populist party's leader and would stand for election in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. Even before Farage's latest bid, pollsters told Yahoo News that Reform UK could pose a serious threat to the Tories by splitting the vote and potentially handing even more seats to Labour.The YouGov projection follows a similar poll by modelling site Electoral Calculus, which came out on 31 May. The polling also compares the 2019 result with Electoral Calculus' projection.It predicts that Labour is on course to win an even bigger majority of 319 seats - with Starmer's party picking up 485 MPs and the Tories way behind with 66. The modelling shows the Lib Dems getting very close to the Conservative Party, with 59 seats.While Electoral Calculus' polling, based on opinion polls from 8 May to 20 May, returns a different set of projections to YouGov's, both clearly indicate the scale of the problem facing Sunak.The Electoral Calculus model has predicted Sir Keir Starmer's Labour will win a massive majority.

Exactly a week later, the populist politician had objects thrown at him from a construction site in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, while riding on an open top deck of a campaign bus.While Farage was unharmed, he told ITV News after the first incident that being pelted in the face by a stranger with an unknown liquid was nonetheless ""quite frightening"".What security do MPs receive and how much does it cost?MPs from across the political spectrum have reported serious threats to their security, with the volume of such cases increasing over the past decade, according to the Institute for Government think tank.Data published by the Metropolitan Police showed the number of alleged crimes against MPs in London had risen from 151 in 2017 to 342 in 2018 – an increase of 126%, while a BBC survey in 2019 found that over 60% of MPs who responded had reported threats to police in the previous year.All MPs are advised to take routine security measures, while others may receive ""enhanced"" or ""further"" security measures in response to individual circumstances, particularly if police have recommended them.Until April 2023, both forms of measures were funded by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), which sets and regulates the payment of MPs’ pay, pensions and business costs.However, since April 2023, routine security measures are funded via accommodation and office cost expenses that MPs can claim from IPSA, while the House of Commons itself pays for further security measures.As for how much it costs, the best available data we have is from before the changes to the rules in April 2023, based on IPSA's security assistance budget.It says that in 2022/23, total spending was £3.3m, which was slightly lower than the £4.4m paid in 2020/21 and 2021/22, but was still 80 times higher than the amount spent in 2010/11.In early 2016, following threats made to MPs over Parliamentary debates on military action in Syria, the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) recommended that all MPs adopt a package of security measures.Concerns continued to rise from then, with the murder of Jo Cox in June 2016, followed by a terror attack outside the Houses of Parliament in March 2017, with funding rising significantly since then.In February 2024 the government announced a £31m package aimed at boosting MPs' security, with prime minister Rishi Sunak claiming there is a ""growing consensus that mob rule is replacing democratic rule"".The government has said that this money will be used to ensure that all elected representatives and election candidates will have a named contact in the police with whom to discuss security matters.It says the funding package will be used to enhance police capabilities, boost private sector security provisions for those facing a higher risk and to increase cyber security advice to locally elected representatives.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

The Conservatives have 275 peers, the Liberal Democrats 79, and 180 peers are non-aligned.It means that unless Sir Keir appoints about 100 peers, the Tories will outnumber Labour in the upper chamber.Such a move will significantly increase the cost of the House of Lords to the taxpayer because peers can claim a daily attendance allowance of £361.Sir Keir Starmer is set to appoint dozens of new peers within weeks of taking office in an attempt to push through his policies - ANDY BUCHANAN/AFPThe plan comes despite Sir Keir’s pledge to eventually abolish the second chamber and replace it with a more democratic body.The Labour leader’s advisers and shadow ministers have successfully argued he needs to make the appointments in the short term.Several women currently outside politics are being lined up for peerages so they can also serve as ministers in a Labour government.“Sue Gray has the pen on the list,” a senior party figure said. Morgan McSweeney, the campaign director, is also closely involved.Thangam Debbonaire, the shadow culture secretary who faces a challenge from the Greens in Bristol, could be given a place in the Lords if she loses.Retiring MPs such as Margaret Beckett, 81, Margaret Hodge, 79 and Harriet Harman, 73, have been tipped for peerages in the dissolution list.A Labour source said: “The general election is far from over, there are still two weeks to go and the focus in Labour HQ is still firmly on the election campaign, not on handing out jobs.“Labour’s manifesto clearly sets out Labour’s long-term commitment to replacing the House of Lords with an alternative second chamber, and any proposals would be consulted on.”"

He was active in youth politics from his teenage years but was also a skilled musician, taking music lessons alongside Norman Cook, who later became better known as a member of The Housemartins and the DJ Fatboy Slim.Starmer played the flute, piano, violin and recorder and was a junior exhibitioner at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.His familyStarmer is married to Victoria, a former solicitor who later retrained in occupational health and now works for the NHS. The pair met through their work in the law in the early 2000s and married in Essex in 2007.She was first seen accompanying her husband when the couple were filmed clapping for carers during the pandemic in 2020 outside their home in Camden.

(Twitter/Keir Starmer)His parentsThe Labour leader's father, Rodney Starmer, worked as a toolmaker in a factory, and his mother Josephine Starmer (née Baker), was a nurse.His father worked long, 14-hour days but spent his time outside work caring for Josephine, who was diagnosed with the autoimmune condition Still’s disease. She required two hip and knee replacements twice in her lifetime and struggled with arthritic pain.As a young man Starmer also helped care for his mother, which he has said led to him being more emotionally reserved. His sister, Katy, recalled: “He’s had to be a grown-up all his life. I’ve always been quite open about my feelings – Keir is good at most things, but not that.” Josephine Starmer died in 2015, and his father three years later.His educationStarmer passed the 11-plus examination, and attended Reigate Grammar School from age 11. While he was at the school it became an independent fee-paying institution, but as an existing student he was exempt from fees, and his tuition in the sixth form was covered by a bursary.After school he studied law at the University of Leeds, this first in his family to attend university, graduating with a first class degree in 1985. He undertook postgraduate law studied at the University of Oxford, where he served as editor of a radical magazine, Socialist Alternatives.A photograph of a younger Starmer as shown on ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories in 2021. (ITV)Why is he a sir?Stamer was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 2014 in recognition of his work in the legal profession, culminating in a five-year term as Director of Public Prosecutions.He first became a barrister in 1987 at the Middle Temple, later joining Doughty Street Chambers and was appointed a Queen’s Counsel in 2002, aged just 39. In 2008 he was appointed head of the Crown Prosecution Service and DPP.During his tenure he chose to prosecute three Labour MPs and a Conservative in the wake of the parliamentary expenses scandal, and was responsible for prosecuting former MP Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce for perverting the course of justice after Pryce claimed responsibility for her former husband’s speeding offence.Starmer on... the NHSThe Labour leader has said that, if elected, his government would “get the NHS working around the clock and pay staff properly to do it”.The remark followed a commitment to provide £1.1bn in funding for the health service to cut waiting lists by paying doctors and nurses to carry out additional out-of-hours care, which would be funded by axing tax breaks for wealthy “non-doms” who hoard money overseas. He added: “The Conservative Party that brought our NHS to its knees will put it in the ground. We have to get it back on its feet.”Starmer describes the NHS as “the crowdfunded solution for all of us”, reinforcing his commitment to healthcare being free at the point of use, but says reform is inevitable or the health service would “remain on life support”. He has pledged to integrate up-to-date technology into every part of the NHS including using artificial intelligence to diagnose disease earlier and more accurately.He supported the doctors strikes, telling ministers: “Don’t break junior doctors, talk to them.

Starmer has said a Labour government would set up a new policy unit to tackle illegal migration and has suggested that a returns agreement for asylum seekers could be negotiated with the European Union to solve the small boats crisis.He described the government’s thwarted Rwanda plan, which would see illegal migrants deported to the African nation but has to be put into practice due to legal blocks, as a “gimmick” and a “farce” and has promised to reverse it.Starmer on... the cost of living crisisStarmer has sought to keep Rishi Sunak’s handling of the cost of living crisis in the minds of voters by claiming that “his fingerprints are all over their struggling household budgets”. In a letter to his shadow cabinet, leaked to The Guardian, he wrote: “Rishi Sunak is the chief architect of choices prioritising the wealthiest and of the government’s failure to get a grip of the economy and get growth going.”He has said he would prioritise tackling inflation, blaming it for putting up prices and eroding household savings, but has pledged to “take the difficult and responsible decisions” to bring it down.Starmer pictured in 2010, when he was director of public prosecution at the CPS, making a statement about MPs who face charges over their expenses claims. (Getty)Starmer on... private schoolsLabour has dropped its early promise to scrap charitable status for private schools, but has committed to levying a 20% VAT rate on school fees removing their “unfair tax break”. The money raised, he said, will be used to address the “appalling state” of the school system for all children.“It’s not an attack on private schools. It’s just saying an exemption you have had is going to go,” he warned private schools who have been critical of the plan – reminding them they are not obliged to pass that tax on to parents in the form of increased fees.Starmer on… the House of LordsWhen he was first Labour leader, Starmer proposed a “root and branch reform of the centre of government… rooting out unearned privilege and addressing unaccountable power”.But his promise to scrap the House of Lords within the first four years of a new parliament - a controversial move that caused a split among his party’s grandees, has been abandoned.Starmer still backs plans for a second chamber “electoral legitimacy”, but as his party nears government he has stepped away from the most radical form of that pledge. He is now reportedly committed to cutting the number of hereditary peers, reducing the size of the chamber and introducing a new appointments process."
Yahoo News UK,Who is Ed Davey? Lib Dem leader attracts attention with election stuntsEverything you need to know about the former minister who has pledged to fight for the NHS.,[],Hannah Fearn,7 June 2024 at 11:47 am·7-min read,7,June,2024,11:47:00,7,"Ed Davey has been involved in a number of comedy stunts since the election was called. (Alamy) With the spotlight on prime minister Rishi Sunak and Labour leader Keir Starmer as they prepare to slug it out in a general election campaign, the focus had started slipping from Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey until a series of stunts put him back in the spotlight.The former coalition government cabinet minister - who lost his seat, punished by voters for getting into bed with the Tories, but then won it back again - is sending a clear message that he should not be overlooked.He’s had a long political career and the climax may still be ahead: if polls continue to shift away from the Conservatives at the current trajectory, there’s a slim possibility that, if the election is held in October, he could end up as Leader of the Opposition.So what do we know about the man behind the third party in British politics? Hannah Fearn finds out.His early lifeEd Davey was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on Christmas Day in 1965. He was the youngest of three boys, but lost his father at just four years old, and his mother followed over a decade later when he was in his mid-teens. She spent three years battling cancer, during which time he nursed his mother together with his grandmother and brother Henry.Once a keen Scout and Air Scout, he later remembers feeling “isolated” at school because of his caring responsibilities, which meant he couldn’t take part in after-school activities or sports. “The last 18 months she was bedridden and in a lot of pain. I’d spend hours on the bed, talking to her,” he said. Davey was with his mother when she died at Nottingham General Hospital, after being placed on an unsuited dementia ward.After both his parents had died, Davey was brought up by his maternal grandparents in the village of Eakring, though his grandfather died soon after. He spent much of his childhood and young adulthood close to his grandmother. “First of all, she was looking after me. Then we were looking after each other,” he said.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

The pair have two children, a son and daughter.Their son, born in 2007 and now a teenager, is disabled with a neurological condition. He attended special schools but is now educated at home with a tutor - a change that Davey said led to him becoming verbal for the first time. He has spoken about his anxiety about who will care for his son when he and his wife are no longer around. “It’s the thing that worries me more than anything else in my life,” he said.Gasson was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in 2012. She was well for many years following her diagnosis, but declined during lockdown and is working on recovering her physical strength.Liberal Democrats election broadcast shows Ed Davey with his son.

Davey has described how he was inspired to study by his mother, who always wanted him to try hard academically and who he wanted to impress.His educationDavey attended the private Nottingham High School, the alma mater of former chancellor Kenneth Clarke. He became head boy, with Labour MP Ed Balls - who was studying in the year below - watching on. After school, he achieved a first class degree in philosophy, politics and economics at Jesus College, Oxford where he was junior common room president. After becoming an economics research for the Liberal Democrats he returned to study, reading for a master’s degree in economics at Birkbeck College, London.Ed Davey, pictured with his family. (Liberal Democrats)Why is he a sir?For three years, the Lib Dem leader was a member of the cabinet during the period of Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, holding the post of secretary of state for energy and climate change from 2012 to 2015. He was knighted in the 2016 New Year’s Honours for “political and public services”.Davey on... the cost of living crisisDavey has repeatedly attacked the government for failing to curb rapid inflation and the devastating effect it is having on household budgets. He called the Conservative Party “so out of touch they might as well be living on another planet”, and said he warned Jeremy Hunt “people are desperate for real help… but all the chancellor could offer is empty words and unfair tax hikes”. In particular, he has urged more action on food price inflation, which analysis from his own party found had risen 37 per cent in one year for the average weekly supermarket trip. He has promised to end energy hikes and abandoned his plan to add 1p to income tax to save the NHS because ordinary voters can no longer afford it.Davey on... the NHSThe Liberal Democrats have made the NHS a cornerstone of their policy platform for the last five years. In Davey’s words: “Voting Conservative is bad for your health.” He promises to reverse cuts to GP numbers and guarantee a doctor’s appointment when you need one, improve access to NHS dentistry and save lives by tackling ambulance call out delays. Davey blames the care crisis for deepening the problems of the health service and says his party would spend £5bn a year on a “care package” to ensure patients are discharged from hospital more quickly, freeing up bed space. However, there is little detail on how this would be financed without raising taxes on the wealthiest - which Davey has promised not to do in his push to poach disillusioned Tory voters.British Leader of the Liberal Democrats party Ed Davey arrives at the BBC Broadcasting House, for his appearance on 'Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg', in London, Britain, April 28, 2024. REUTERS/Maja SmiejkowskaDavey on... immigrationThe Lib Dem leader has been a long-standing advocate for refugee rights and critic of the government’s immigration policy. He has called for Conservative plans to deport failed asylum seekers to Rwanda a “cynical distraction” from the partygate crisis and the money would be better spent on measures to tackle the cost of living crisis. He added: “They’ve provided no evidence to suggest that this new policy will stop illegal smuggling, they’re not cracking down on the organised crime gangs, which is what you need to do.” He has called for a new right to work for refugees and asylum seekers, and major reform of the Home Office which he says is no longer up to the job. After the end of the coalition government, Davey has said his party “was wrong” to go along with the introduction of a minimum income standard for immigrants. He later described the policy as “nasty and unfair”.Davey on... the Post Office scandalDespite the Horizon scandal that led to the wrongful prosecution of more than 700 subpostmasters crossing the tenure of more than a dozen business secretaries, Ed Davey has recently taken the heat for failing to investigate the issue while he was in the job.It has emerged that Davey initially rejected a request to meet justice campaigner Alan Bates, and later accepted it only on the advice that it would be good for his PR. He has recently apologised for not acting earlier, admitting that he is sorry that he “did not see through Post Office lies” about the fault in the Horizon programme."
The Telegraph,Rishi Sunak’s startup fund pulls the plug on dozens of companies,[],James Titcomb,23 June 2024 at 8:15 am·2-min read,23,June,2024,08:15:00,2,"Future Fund, championed by Rishi Sunak when he was chancellor, has long faced questions about its profitability - PA/Benjamin CremelRishi Sunak’s Covid start-up fund has pushed dozens of companies into liquidation in an attempt to recover taxpayer loans.The Future Fund has issued winding up petitions to 32 companies that it backed during the pandemic, according to court records.In many cases it has resulted in the business being ordered to cease trading by courts and the company wound up without the fund recouping its investment.The Future Fund was championed by Mr Sunak in 2020 when he was chancellor as a way to support loss-making start-ups during the pandemic, but has faced questions about whether it would make a profit.ADVERTISEMENTIt lent £1.1 billion to 1,191 companies on three-year terms, with the loans converting into shares when the businesses raised a “follow-on” investment. If the companies did not raise further investment they were required to repay the loans back double and with interest.With the loans now maturing, the fund has taken some companies to court to recover investments of up to £5 million, issuing winding-up petitions – an attempt to force a company into compulsory liquidation.Of 32 cases since the end of 2022, 23 taxpayer-backed companies have been placed into administration or liquidated.They included AiSolve, a virtual reality company that owed £11.4 million; the investment app Dabbl; and companies supported by Nova Group, a start-up investment business backed by former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy.A spokesman for the British Business Bank, which operates the fund, said it had “a duty to protect the interests of taxpayers”. The bank said it had granted extensions to the majority of companies that requested them rather than demand repayment.Sir Terry Leahy's investment group supported some of those companies that have been placed into administration or liquidated - Andrew Crowley“Of the companies with loans outstanding at their maturity date not every company has applied for an extension,” a BBB spokesman said. “Of those that have applied for a loan extension, not all applications have been successful.“We have a duty to protect the interests of taxpayers. When companies get to the maturity date and their loans remain outstanding, we will take steps to recover funds, which may include seeking to wind up companies. We will work with liquidators to assist their investigations and their efforts to recover assets for creditors.”At the end of March, the Future Fund had converted 712 loans into stakes in companies, and 211 loans were outstanding. A total 202 companies have become insolvent, while 66 have resulted in cash returns for the fund. Last year, the BBB said the fund had lost £289 million on a fair value basis."
The Guardian,Labour plans to build 1.5m homes. Will that help Britons struggling for good housing?,[],Heather Stewart,23 June 2024 at 10:00 am·8-min read,23,June,2024,10:00:00,8,"Labour appears poised to win a historic election victory on 4 July. In the series Life under Labour, we look at Keir Starmer’s five key political missions, and ask what is at stake and whether he can deliver the change the country is crying out for.* * *“We have no space for ourselves, no space to think – and particularly for my children it’s a real struggle.” Before Keir Starmer launched Labour’s manifesto in Manchester this month, Daniel, a father from east London, took to the same stage to share his experiences of bringing up two children in a one-bed flat.“To say we find it difficult is an understatement,” he said, going on to praise “Keir’s plan to build a lot more homes”.Rachel Reeves’s fierce caution on tax and spend is perhaps the best known aspect of Labour’s mission to kickstart the economy. But the prominence of Daniel’s story in Labour’s pitch underlines the importance of another key element of the party’s economic plans: unblocking the UK’s notoriously sluggish planning system.Labour has claimed it will ensure that 1.5m homes are built over the next five years. But how significant are these plans, and what difference could they make to achieving the goal of economic growth – and to improving life for Britons at the sharp end of the housing crisis?Ant Breach, a housing and planning expert at thinktank the Centre for Cities, says getting housebuilding plans right would be good for growth. “If you’re a government looking to improve economic growth, then changing the planning system is by far the easiest route you can pick.“Partly, if there’s more housebuilding, there’s more construction jobs, there’s greater ability to absorb investment – but also it’s about increasing disposable income after housing costs; it means there’s more money in people’s pockets.“If we can help people live closer to city centres in particular – a reasonable commute away, rather than all congested on the roads or on public transport – then that’s a long-term and permanent productivity boost, even beyond the short-term rush of a construction boom.”The scale of the housing crisis in the UK may be familiar, but that doesn’t make it any less staggering. In its most recent quarterly update on the sector, the Resolution Foundation thinktank pointed out that dwellings in the UK are smaller, older and cost us more of our income than in most comparable countries.The inveterately careful Starmer has reached for unusually combative language when it comes to tackling the issue, promising in last year’s party conference speech to “bulldoze through” the UK’s “restrictive planning system” and even challenging the taboo of building on the green belt.Since the mid-1950s, when the Conservative housing minister, Duncan Sandys, issued historic planning guidance aimed at limiting the sprawl of cities, the country’s green belt – or more accurately, green belts – have rarely been questioned by politicians.But Labour wants to allow local authorities to earmark more green-belt land for homes, beginning with brownfield sites and then a new category of “grey belt” – pockets of green-belt land that are not nature-rich and beautiful, but scrubby and unloved.“Hopefully, it’s the beginning of a sensible conversation about what’s the purpose of the green belt and how restrictive should it be,” says Breach.Related: England’s green belt can’t stay entirely untouched for ever, building design tsar saysThe green-belt plans are part of a battery of Labour planning policies that also include reintroducing mandatory local housing targets scrapped by the Tories, giving planning powers to combined authorities, and publishing new design codes, to try to raise the quality of what gets built.The party has promised to fund 300 new planning officers to try to beef up councils’ resources – and crucially, review the system of “hope value”, which can mean landowners are paid well above the market rate for a plot, on the basis of what it might one day be worth with planning permission.The party also says it will quickly establish an independent taskforce to lead the job of identifying the right sites for several new towns, with the ambitious aim of delivering homes on some of these sites by the end of a single five-year parliamentary term.This is one of many areas where the new government, if Labour gets into power as expected, is likely to draw on an army of broadly progressive policy experts and industry leaders who have sat out the Tory years and are ready to get stuck in.Freddie Poser, a spokesperson for the campaign group PricedOut, said: “You need to get going very quickly if you want to deliver new towns, but it is definitely possible, especially if you prioritise places where there is existing transport infrastructure which could be upgraded without having to build it from scratch.”As well as housing, Starmer has talked about his government making it easier to win planning consent for key infrastructure, and for businesses to expand: part of the prospectus for “wealth creation” he repeatedly referred to in Manchester.As with industrial strategy – another plank of the economic mission – Labour’s approach appears set to be unashamedly interventionist.Related: Change? If only. Labour’s housing plans are built on flimsy foundations, fantasies and fudgeOn housing, the political calculation is that the crisis has become so severe that the risks of infuriating local opponents of new development are outweighed by the potential gains in being seen to tackle the issue.Recent YouGov polling pointed to a sharp increase in voter concern about housing. More than a third of 18--24-year-olds, and more than a quarter of 25-49-year-olds identified it as one of the top three issues facing the country.Poser agrees with the idea that it will be a political benefit if the party gets housebuilding right – but underlines the urgency needed.“If they are successful, they will be rewarded with dividends from voters who see a party that is finally serious about building homes. But the flipside of that is, five years is obviously not a huge amount of time to get that started.”Not everyone in Labour, however, is convinced that the politics of housebuilding has swung as far against nimbyism as Starmer and his colleagues clearly hope.After the leader’s “bulldozing” conference speech, one senior party adviser privately expressed astonishment that this was the particular fight with some voters that Starmer was prepared to pick (and not, say, the argument over a wealth tax).They recalled knocking on doors in a recently built housing estate where residents were up in arms about the potential for another new development up the road. Such concerns are likely to be amplified if Labour wins a large number of seats in areas earmarked for rapid housing expansion – and hopes to hold on to them.But given the prominence of housing in the campaign, a Labour government appears unlikely to face backbench opposition of the kind that scuppered Conservative plans to overhaul the planning system three years ago.Indeed, as the shadow housing minister, Matthew Pennycook, made clear in a round of interviews on Thursday, many of the changes Labour plans to make can be implemented without new legislation.Labour insiders say that with the groundwork already prepared, this process can begin immediately after the election on 4 July, through a blitz of ministerial statements and statutory instruments.The mood among longtime housing campaigners is of guarded optimism: they appreciate the gung-ho rhetoric, but as in so many other areas of Labour’s pitch, wonder whether the party will put sufficient resources behind it.Charles Trew, the head of policy at Shelter, says it is “genuinely affordable” socially rented housing that matters, after a long period in which local authority homes have been sold off through right to buy and not replaced. “We have lost 260,000 social rented homes since 2010,” he says.Labour has not promised an increase in funding for the Affordable Homes Programme, which backs building projects, instead leaning on the idea that private-sector housebuilders can be pressed into including more affordable property in developments.As Angela Rayner, the shadow communities secretary, has put it: “Developers have been let off the hook and for too long allowed to wriggle out of their responsibilities to provide new social and affordable homes. Labour will robustly hold them to account.”Trew welcomed the fact that Rayner had promised “the biggest boost to affordable, social and council housing for a generation”, but pointed out that Labour had given no specific target for social homes. “It would be great to see a number, and the funding to deliver it.”Without a plan for a significant increase in taxpayer-funded housing, Labour will be reliant on developers, who are in turn subject to the whims of the markets – as with other areas of its programme, such as the “green prosperity plan”, which require a heavy injection of private-sector capital.Breach suggests reform more radical than anything Labour has yet proposed would be the best way to achieve its goals: a zoning system, in which areas are earmarked as ripe for development, and the presumption is then in favour of permission being granted. This was the approach mooted by Robert Jenrick when he was housing secretary but killed off by Tory MPs.“Our system is very dysfunctional, very discretionary, relative to that of other countries,” Breach says.Ryan Shorthouse, chair of the centre-right thinktank Bright Blue, who has previously lamented the Conservatives’ failure to tackle housing affordability, agreed that something akin to zoning may be necessary for Labour to meet its ambitious promises – but confessed himself “excited” about the prospect for change. “At the end of the day, a lot of it is about politics. Everything’s going to change after this election, and the whole tone of the debate will be different,” he says."
Yahoo News UK,"Three important UK election issues, explainedRishi Sunak said his leadership is needed in 'uncertain' times. Keir Starmer said the country needs to be 'rebuilt'. So what issues do voters care about most?","['The economy', 'Health', 'Immigration and asylum']",James Cheng-Morris,Updated 28 May 2024 at 11:11 am·5-min read,28,May,2024,11:11:00,5,"After months of speculation, Rishi Sunak confirmed the general election will be held on 4 July.The prime minister said Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer could not be trusted to lead the country through “uncertain” times. He made the economy and combating global security the key elements of his pitch to the nation as he announced the election date.In response, Starmer told voters: “Together we can stop the chaos, we can turn the page, we can start to rebuild Britain.”But amid this “uncertainty” and need to “rebuild”, what do the voters consider the key issues?This chart, produced using YouGov polling over the course of this parliament, offers an insight in the issues voters care most about and how that has ebbed and flowed over time.Compared to when Boris Johnson's Tories won the December 2019 poll, the economy, immigration, defence and tax have grown in importance in the eyes of the electorate. This has come amid the cost of living crisis; small boats crossing the English Channel; the onset of the Ukraine war and wider global instability; and the highest tax burden in 70 years.Housing has also become a bigger concern, with the Renters Reform Bill - in which the government pledged to scrap no-fault evictions - having been paused after Sunak called the election.Meanwhile, the last general election was fought - and won by the Tories - on a single issue: Brexit. Yet the chart shows a clear downturn in its relevance among voters, particularly after a trade deal was agreed with the EU in December 2020.This next chart, meanwhile, highlights what voters have considered the top issues over the past year. By a wide margin, the top three are the economy, health and immigration and asylum.Here, Yahoo News UK breaks down what is behind these issues and how they have ebbed and flowed in importance among voters since the last election in 2019.The economyThe unprecedented lockdown called by Boris Johnson in March 2020 meant the public’s attention shifted to the economy, as demonstrated by the huge spike in the chart above. The then-chancellor Rishi Sunak was forced to implement a £70bn furlough scheme, lasting 18 months, to protect people’s jobs.There was a second almighty economic shock - and rise in public concern - in February 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This caused a further spike in an already turbulent wholesale energy market, driving up costs for suppliers and ultimately customers.Average energy bills eventually reached £2,500 a year (and would have exceeded £4,000 had the government not intervened). This was double the £1,278 consumers were paying before the war and by the time this election takes place, people will still be paying much more than this: £1,568.Energy prices were also a key driver in inflation reaching 11.1% - a 41-year high - by October 2022, though it has since fallen to 2.3%, which is near the Bank of England’s 2.0% target.The third economic shock of this parliament - and most damaging for the Tories - was in October 2022 when Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng's disastrous “mini budget”, containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, prompted an economic crisis. It led to soaring interest rates, and to this day homeowners who are remortgaging are facing significantly higher bills.HealthHealth, like the economy, is another issue which clearly correlated with the beginning of the pandemic. The above chart shows an enormous spike in public concern when COVID cases started to multiply in March 2020, ultimately leading to the nationwide lockdown as the NHS faced collapse.Cases fell that summer, but spikes in the chart can be seen once infections rose again and fresh nationwide lockdowns were imposed in October 2020 and January 2021. By March 2022, likely as concerns over the Omicron variant faded, there was much less concern about health.In January last year, there was a brief spike as the NHS in England experienced the biggest industrial action in its history, with tens of thousands of nurses and ambulance staff walking out simultaneously.As for the state of play going into the election, NHS waiting lists remain higher than they were when Sunak vowed to cut them last year. According to the latest figures, an estimated 7.54 million treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of March, relating to 6.29 million patients.Immigration and asylumSince the last election, the immigration and asylum narrative has largely revolved around one issue: small boats crossing the English Channel.The numbers have risen in most of the intervening years: there were 1,843 crossings in 2019, 8,466 in 2020, 28,526 in 2021, 45,774 in 2022 and 29,437 last year. This year, the number has already passed the 10,000 mark.The regular sharp spikes in the above chart demonstrate how frequently crossings have been in the news, including some occasions when hundreds of migrants have made the dangerous journey in a single day.But it also reflects how the government has made this part of its own agenda. It was Boris Johnson’s government which first announced plans to deport migrants to Rwanda in April 2022. That policy was picked up by Rishi Sunak when he became prime minister in October that year, with Sunak since repeating his pledge to “stop the boats”.But after calling the election, Sunak admitted this week that flights would not take off before the country goes to the polls.Read moreFive important laws that could be dropped due to Sunak's snap election (Yahoo News UK)OPINION - Rishi Sunak has been in last-ditch campaign mode for so long — a General Election is logical (Evening Standard)Door open for Boris Johnson to campaign for Tories, Rishi Sunak signals (PA Media)"

The term is also sometimes used to refer to the election itself, as in ‘they could not win at the ballot box’.CampaignThe time before an election in which politicians persuade people to vote for them. In the case of the 2024 election in the UK, parliament was dissolved on the 30 May and the election will take place on 4 July.CanvassingGoing round a particular area trying to persuade people to vote for one party or the other.In UK elections, this is often done by volunteers knocking on people’s doors.Capital gains taxCapital gains tax is a tax on profit when people sell assets that have increased in value.In the 2024 election, the Conservatives have promised that landlords who sell to sitting tenants will be spared capital gains tax on the proceeds, while Labour has left the door open to raising capital gains.Child benefitChild benefit is a benefit paid to parents with children under 16 (or under 20 in approved education or training).The Conservatives have promised to increase the threshold at which high earners start to lose the benefit from £60,000 to £120,000.Sir Keir Starmer, like the Conservatives, has pledged not to raise VAT.

For example, both the 2010 election and 2017 elections resulted in hung parliament.In 2010, the Conservatives formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, while in 2017, the Conservatives formed a minority government with a 'confidence and supply' agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).Income tax thresholdThe thresholds between the tax-free allowance, basic rate tax and higher rates of tax.Both parties have said they will continue the freeze on income tax thresholds brought in under the Conservatives, which means people pay more tax as more and more people are pushed into higher tax brackets if wages rise.MajorityA party with a majority – more than half of the seats in the House of Commons – has won the election.The number of votes by which an individual MP wins a constituency is also referred to as their majority.ManifestoPolitical parties publish manifestos before a general election, with a set of policies that the party stands for and aims to implement if elected.Manifesto pledges are not legally binding.Marginal seatA seat in which the incumbent MP won by a small majority, meaning a swing is more likely than in a so-called ‘safe seat’ where the MP had a large majority.Net zeroThe UK Government has set a goal for Britain’s emissions to reach net zero – where emission and removal of greenhouse gases reaches equilibrium – by 2050.All major parties are expected to stick to this goal, barring Reform UK.Opinion pollAn opinion poll is a research survey (usually carried out on a representative sample of the electorate) to gauge likely results in an election.Poll‘The polls’ refers to the places where people vote in an election: exit polls and opinion polls refer to two kinds of survey used to predict election results.Postal voteAn absentee vote where the vote is sent in by post.At the 2019 general election, 17.2% of voters across the UK used a postal ballot.Proxy voteA vote where a person who can’t make it to the booth appoints someone to vote for them.In the 2019 election, 0.6% of voters appointed a proxy.PsephologyPsephology is the scientific study of elections and voting and is used to predict and analyse election results.Polling dayThe day when the country places their vote: in the UK 2024 election, this is July 4.PurdahBefore British elections, the country enters purdah, officially known as the ‘pre-election period of sensitivity’.Purdah means that politicians (both local and national) and other people such as civil servants face restrictions on what they can do and announce.Ministers who remain in office can’t announce new funding, or new policies, or anything which might sway voters or make the government more popular.The idea is that public money cannot be spent on the election.Spoiled ballotA ballot paper which has been marked wrongly (for instance with a vote for more than one candidate) will not be counted.Sometimes people spoil ballots deliberately as a protest vote to show dissatisfactionSwing‘Swing’ is the change in voter support for a political party between one election and the next.It is used to analyse the performance of parties in different areas.Tax burdenThe tax burden refers to the total amount of taxes paid by a group (in this case the UK as a whole) as a proportion of total income.The tax burden is currently at its highest in 70 years according to the OECD.The Equality ActThe 2010 Equality Act protects people against discrimination in Britain.The Conservatives want to ‘tweak’ the Act so that sex-based protections only apply on the basis of someone’s biological sex.Triple lockThe triple lock is a guarantee introduced to the state pension in 2010 so it would not lose value in real terms.The guarantee means that the state pension will rise by the highest out of average earnings, inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) or 2.5%.Triple lock plusThe ‘triple lock plus’ is a Conservative policy, which would see the tax-free pension allowance rise every year in line with the triple lock of average wages, inflation, or 2.5% – whichever is highest, to prevent pensioners being pulled into paying income tax.TurnoutTurnout refers to the percentage of people eligible to vote who turn out to vote on election day.In the 2019 election, for example, 67.3% of those eligible turned out to vote.VATValue added tax is added to goods and services sold by VAT-registered companies, and is the third-largest source of government income after income tax and national insurance.Both Labour and the Conservatives have pledged not to raise VAT.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

All the polls use the multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP) technique, which enables projections to be made at constituency level.And while all three polls indicate Sunak faces an uphill battle to avoid a major defeat, there is a significant disparity from all three as to how far ahead Keir Starmer actually is.Yahoo summaries the key points of the three pollsTories to slump to lowest number of seats since party's formationYouGov's polling for Sky News projects Labour is on course to achieve a 200-seat majority. Labour is predicted to secure 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.This projection would show the Tories plummeting from the 365 won by Boris Johnson in the 2019 election and give the party their lowest ever number of MPs. It would also give Starmer more seats than the 418 won by Tony Blair in 1997. Read a full report of this poll from Sky NewsThe YouGov poll for Sky News.Conservatives on course for worst defeat in over a centuryAccording to polling by More In Common UK for the News Agents podcast, Labour is projected to finish on 406 seats, a majority of 162.

This polling puts Labour on a massive 516 seats, with the Tories on only 53 - just in front of the Lib Dems on 50 - a forecast that would be remarkable were it to be reflected on polling night.

Given the nature of these seat totals, it is natural to be slightly sceptical.""It adds: ""Not every MRP is the same. The statistical 'building blocks' used to model voter behaviour will vary from pollster to pollster, which will in turn lead to different vote shares and seat totals. All different pollsters will get different national vote share.""The MRP methodology, as described by YouGov, ""uses data at the constituency level to predict the outcomes of seats based on the concentration of various different types of voters who live there"".Stuart Wilks-Heeg, writing in The Conversation earlier this month, points out some of the other limitations of MRP polling: ""There are ... factors MRPs cannot take into account. Some constituency results will be influenced by locally specific issues that statistical models can’t capture. For example, adjustments cannot be made for who the candidates are in each constituency and whether any have a profile that could enhance, or detract from, their party’s chance of winning. Think Nigel Farage standing for Reform UK in Clacton.""And competing MRPs produce contrasting outcomes because each model uses specific assumptions and data. Different inputs produce different outputs. This election has seen more MRPs produced than ever before, and from various organisations. In the early hours of July 5, we’ll know which one came closest to getting the result correct.""What are the latest odds?As of 19 June, Oddschecker – a website which compares odds across different bookmakers – had Labour at 1/41 to win the most seats. To put that in context, this is seen as so likely that a £10 bet would return just £10.24.The Conservatives are 40/1 to win the most seats, a scenario seen as so unlikely that a £10 punt would return £410.What went wrong for the Tories?YouGov's voting intention tracker between January 2020 and June 2024. (YouGov)So, why have the polls changed so dramatically? It's worth looking back on an extremely eventful four-and-a-half years in UK politics.According to YouGov's voting intention tracker (see chart, above), Tory support peaked at 53%, with Labour on 32%, in April 2020, months after the party's stunning success in the 2019 general election and Boris Johnson's pledge to “get Brexit done”. That month also saw Starmer take over as Labour leader from Jeremy Corbyn.This was also amid a spirit of national unity following the onset of the COVID pandemic which nearly killed Johnson himself. The then-PM had been released from hospital five days before this particular survey was taken.Boris Johnson delivers his final speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street in September 2022. (AFP via Getty Images)Over the rest of the year, there was a downturn in support amid chaos over COVID rules, with the Tories falling as low as 35% in November 2020, compared to Labour on 40%.However, the UK’s successful COVID vaccination programme provided a pathway out of lockdown and with it, improved poll ratings. Tory support peaked at 41% in June 2021, with Labour at 30%.In October that year, there was a sense Johnson was untouchable. At the Tory party conference, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg remarked how the PM was ""in total command of his party, and politically dominant in the country"".But this fell apart quickly with the Partygate scandal, which emerged in November that year. Time and again, reports emerged of government and Tory staff – including Johnson – having taken part in lockdown-era social gatherings when their own COVID rules had prohibited them.By January 2022, Tory support had plummeted to 28%, with Labour on 38%. Johnson struggled on, but never recovered and a wave of ministerial resignations forced him to resign in July that year.The UK had three separate prime ministers – Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak – between 6 September and 24 October, 2022. (Getty Images)His successor, Liz Truss, then embarked on arguably the most disastrous prime ministerial reign in history, characterised by the catastrophic ""mini-budget"", containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, which prompted an economic crisis. Like Johnson, she lost the confidence of Tory MPs – and voters – and had to resign.Her 49-day spell as PM was the shortest in history, with Tory support plummeting to 19% (with Labour on 56%) the day after she announced her resignation in October 2022.Rishi Sunak, who had lost to Truss in the previous month's Tory leadership election, took over. However, as the above YouGov chart indicates, he has failed to cut through with voters. Tory support was at 23% two days after he assumed office, with the most recent survey, carried out on Thursday, showing support is now lower than under Truss at 18%.In short, the polls and odds, not to mention other factors such as notable by-election victories for Starmer's Labour, are pointing to a Labour government next month.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

I think not,” he said.Asked whether he thought the PM should suspend those involved, he said: “I do.”And former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng told GB News: “It’s childish and incredibly stupid. How did they think they wouldn’t be caught?” He pointed the finger at Mr Sunak, saying he is in charge so is “ultimately responsible”.He went on: “Sometimes it might be unfair, maybe he didn’t know what was going on, but as the leader of an organisation, your character, your job is to impose some sort of discipline on the institution, and if things go wrong – I know it’s an old-fashioned view, and people don’t really subscribe to it any more, but ultimately I think the leader bears responsibility for what’s going on.”After a day of silence from the prime minister, Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper told The Independent: “Rishi Sunak must personally intervene to order a Cabinet Office inquiry and suspend all those under investigation by the Gambling Commission.Pat McFadden has urged the Gambling Commission to name those being investigated (PA Wire)“People are sick and tired of this sleaze. Day by day, hour by hour, the Conservative government mire themselves in more of it.”In his damning letter to the Gambling Commission, Mr McFadden said: “With postal ballots already being sent out, many millions of people will be casting their vote this week. They deserve to have all relevant facts about this scandal at their disposal when doing so.“I believe it is in the public interest that the Gambling Commission makes public the names of other figures you are investigating relating to this matter. There will be particular interest in whether any government ministers bet on the date of the election before it was called.”The Independent has revealed that an unnamed cabinet minister is believed to be among several figures being investigated, with numerous senior Tories ruling themselves out including Grant Shapps, Penny Mordaunt, James Cleverly, Mark Harper and Mr Gove.Former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has laid the blame at Rishi Sunak’s door (PA)Over the weekend, the Conservative Party’s chief data officer Nick Mason became the latest figure to be placed under investigation by the Gambling Commission.He is the fourth named figure close to the party leadership to come under investigation by the gambling watchdog for allegedly betting on the timing of the election before the date had been announced.The latest allegations were published by The Sunday Times, which claimed that dozens of bets had been placed by Mr Mason with potential winnings worth thousands of pounds.Mr Gove said: “The perception that we operate outside the rules that we set for others – that was damaging at the time of Partygate and is damaging here.“If you’re in a privileged position, [close] to the prime minister, at the heart of a political operation, and you use inside information to make additional money for yourself, that’s just not acceptable. So if these allegations are true, it’s very difficult to defend.”Home secretary Mr Cleverly said he would not defend any Tories found to have placed bets, but that it was a matter for the Gambling Commission to investigate.He said: “My understanding is that it is a small number of individuals” involved, adding: “There is an investigation by the Gambling Commission, and we have been told very, very clearly that we are not to discuss the investigations.”Several reports suggested that the commission was investigating “many more” individuals and had widened its inquiry to include potential bets by family and friends of those connected to the party.An industry source told The Independent that the Gambling Commission had asked for details of all the bets made on a July election after 1 May, and that it is now “combing through the data and picking off people from that”.The revelations are a fresh blow to Rishi Sunak’s hopes of getting the Tory election campaign on track, after three other Conservative figures were caught up in the scandal.Craig Williams, Mr Sunak’s parliamentary private secretary, who is standing in Montgomeryshire, was the first Tory candidate to be publicly linked to the betting scandal.Laura Saunders, who has worked for the Tories since 2015 and is standing in Bristol North West, and her husband Tony Lee, director of campaigning, are both being investigated.Shadow education secretary Ms Phillipson described “genuine disgust” among voters over the general election betting.She told the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: “People across the country will place bets, but I think there is genuine disgust amongst so many voters that what we’re seeing here is pretty shocking behaviour.“Rishi Sunak promised us that his government would be different; he hasn’t acted against candidates concerned, he should suspend them, and – as Michael Gove has said – this just reminds people of the worst excesses of the Conservatives over the last 14 years.”"

Some three-quarters of the Cabinet would lose their seats in that scenario – including Sunak.Were Sunak to lose his seat in Richmond (Yorks), it would make him the first prime minister in history to lose their seat in a general election, according to the Institute for Government. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is also facing a battle to hold on to his constituency, with the vote on a “knife edge”.Savanta spoke to around 18,000 people between 7 June and 18 June for their poll.

Who are they, and what are they being investigated for?Craig WilliamsThe Tory candidate for re-election in Montgomeryshire and Glyndŵr is a key member of the prime minister’s inner circle. As Sunak’s parliamentary private secretary in the last parliament, Williams helped the prime minister to manage relations with MPs.When the Guardian revealed on 12 June that Williams had placed a £100 bet on there being a July election three days before Sunak announced the date in May, Williams admitted having a “flutter” on the election and said one of his betting accounts was the subject of inquiries by the Gambling Commission.The next day he apologised for the bet, which had odds of 5-1, meaning he could have made £500, and conceded that he had made a “huge error of judgment”. He has refused to answer questions about whether he was privy to inside information before placing the bet.Police protection officerThe only person to have so far faced disciplinary action over the scandal is an unnamed Metropolitan police officer who is part of Sunak’s close protection security team. The officer was arrested on 17 June for the alleged offence of misconduct in public office, after the force was contacted by the Gambling Commission.When the matter was referred to the Met’s directorate of professional standards and the police watchdog, the officer was also removed from operational duties. Details of any bets placed by the officer have not been disclosed.Laura SaundersSaunders, who is married to the Conservative’s campaign director. Tony Lee, is standing for the party in Bristol North West. She became the second prospective parliamentary candidate to be investigated by the Gambling Commission over an alleged bet about the timing of the election, the BBC reported last week.The size and the timing of Saunders’ alleged bet or bets is not known. Saunders has confirmed that she is cooperating with the commission and accused the BBC of breaching her right to privacy. Saunders joined the Conservatives at the age of 18 and has worked for the party since 2015.Tony LeeLee, who is married to Saunders, was appointed as the Tories’ director of campaigning by Oliver Dowden when he was co-chair of the party. Dowden, who is now deputy prime minister, told the Conservatives’ spring conference in Blackpool in March 2022 that Lee was part of a “fantastic team” who had “masterminded” Andy Street’s successful election campaign to be West Midlands mayor the previous year.The Conservative party confirmed that Lee had taken leave of absence after it emerged that he also was being investigated by the Gambling Commission over an undisclosed alleged bet or bets.Nick MasonOn his X account, Mason describes himself as “data-driven insight evangelist” as well as a Tory campaigner and the party’s candidate for Jarrow in Tyneside in the 2015 election. He has been party’s chief data officer since 2022 and on Sunday was named by the Sunday Times as the fourth Conservative to be investigated by the Gambling Commission.Like Lee, he has taken “leave of absence” from the party. He is alleged to have placed several dozen bets over an unknown period before the date of the snap election was announced, according to the Sunday Times.The combined winnings would have amounted to thousands of pounds, the paper said. A spokesperson for Mason said it would be inappropriate to comment while the investigation was under way, but that he denied wrongdoing."

A spokesman for the official told the paper that he denied wrongdoing.What are the rules for MPs and others on betting with inside knowledge?Using confidential information to gain an unfair advantage when betting may constitute a criminal offence.Gamblers are not allowed to use inside information to place a bet or to instruct someone else to do so on their behalf.They are also not allowed to pass inside information on to someone else which they use for betting.Laura Saunders (Laura Saunders)Additionally, the MPs’ code of conduct bars members from “causing significant damage to the reputation and integrity of the house”.An MP placing a bet with inside knowledge is likely to cross this threshold.Who else is being investigated?Craig Williams, the PM’s parliamentary private secretary, was the first person caught up in the scandal.He admitted placing a bet on the election prior to Mr Sunak’s announcement after he was approached by a journalist.The 39-year-old Tory candidate for Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr placed a £100 bet with 5-1 odds at Ladbrokes, meaning he would have won £500, but his name was raised as potentially a “politically exposed person”, so the wager was not registered.The bookmaker is believed to be particularly cautious over “novelty” betting markets such as the general election.According to The Guardian, which first reported the story, the bet was placed via an online account that would have required Mr Williams to provide personal details, including his date of birth and debit card. The bookmaker also knows the location of the bet.Ladbrokes declined to comment on the incident but the Gambling Commission issued a statement confirming that it was investigating.Mr Williams apologised after admiting that he had placed a wager on the bet, but refused to comment further while the GC carried out its probe.“I clearly made a huge error of judgment, that’s for sure, and I apologise,” he told. “I will not be expanding on my statement because it’s an independent process.”Laura Saunders became the second person to be named in the affair.Ms Saunders, the Tory candidate for Bristol North West, is also under investigation by the Gambling Commission (GC) over claims she may have had inside knowledge about the prime minister’s decision to call a snap poll for 4 July.Ms Saunders has worked for the party since 2015 and was married to Tony Lee, who works as the Conservative Party’s director of campaigns. Mr Lee has since taken a leave of absence after it came to light he was the third person being probed by the GC.According to the BBC, which first named Ms Saunders as the candidate under investigation, she worked most recently at the party’s international division at Conservative Campaign Headquarters, which works with other centre-right parties around the world.Close protection officer arrestedA police officer in Mr Sunak’s close protection team was arrested and suspended over alleged bets about the timing of the general election.The police constable from the Met’s Royalty and Specialist Protection Command was arrested on 17 June on suspicion of misconduct in public office after the betting watchdog contacted the force last Friday.The officer was taken into custody and bailed pending further enquiries, with the case being referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, according to the Met.What have senior Tories said about the scandal?Mr Sunak said it was “very disappointing” news that Mr Williams was being investigated by the GC.“Well, it’s very disappointing news and you would have seen Craig Williams say that it was a huge error of judgement,” he told broadcasters at the G7 summit earlier in June.After further revelations, Mr Sunak said he would sack anyone found guilty of wrongdoing.“These investigations are ongoing … one of them is a criminal investigation that’s being conducted by the police,” he told the BBC Question Time Leaders Special general election debate. “What I can tell you is if anyone is found to have broken the rules, not only should they face the full consequences of the law, I will make sure that they are booted out of the Conservative Party.”Michael Gove, the outgoing cabinet minister, said it would be “reprehensible” to use inside information to bet on the general election date.“If people have used inside information to place bets, that is deeply wrong,” he told the BBC on Thursday morning after Ms Saunders’s case came to light.“What I can’t do is sort of get too much into the detail of the case while an investigation is going on.“But I can talk about the broad principle and you’re absolutely right, it’s reprehensible.”After Mr Mason was named the fourth Tory under investigation, Mr Gove likened the controversy to the Partygate scandal, saying it looked like there is “one rule for them and one rule for us”."
The Independent,Meet Rishi Sunak’s Labour Party opponent who hopes to bring the PM down,[],David Maddox,23 June 2024 at 1:14 pm·6-min read,23,June,2024,01:14:00,6,"The man who could become the face of the greatest shock in British political history has claimed that whether he wins or not, there is a “bubbling undercurrent” of change in the electorate which means once safe Tory strongholds will fall.Tom Wilson is the 29-year-old Labour candidate running against Rishi Sunak in Richmond and Northallerton who, according to polls last week, could be the first electoral “king killer” – in that he may be the first person to defeat a sitting prime minister in a general election.He became a person of interest for the entire political establishment when an MRP poll last week suggested Mr Sunak’s constituency was “too close to call”.For everyone looking for the so-called “Portillo moment” of this election – named after the shock defeat of Michael Portillo in the 1997 Tory collapse – this looked unbeatable.Tom Wilson met the prime minister briefly on Sunday, shaking hands while both out campaigning in the constituency (Tom Wilson)In his first major interview with a national newspaper, Mr Wilson told The Independent that the feedback he is getting on the doorstep in the Yorkshire constituency he grew up in suggests that the ultimate electoral shock may be possible.But the fact that the Tories are reportedly sending extra bodies to help the prime minister hold on to a seat he won with a majority north of 27,000 in 2019 is a victory in itself.“It feels like years ago [when] I first made my application,” Mr Wilson told The Independent. “It was very much about making them work for it. And actually, we’ve already achieved that. So yeah, in that sense we’ve already won.”He laughed about the prospect of activists being bussed up from CCHQ in London to save the prime minister.“There’s rumours, isn’t there? I’m yet to see a bunch of suited types lost in the dales.Tom Wilson is Labour’s candidate for Richmond and Northallerton (Tom Wilson)“They’re clearly restricting things to higher ground [with] the story about supposedly bringing resources out of seats with majorities of up to 7,000.“We have to treat that almost as a bit of a ruse. There’s no reason they necessarily are going to tell everyone that they’re doing this. We can’t be complacent.”Mr Wilson met the prime minister briefly on Sunday, shaking hands while both out campaigning in the constituency. There was another awkward moment at a show where he was running an allotment stall while Mr Sunak was doing a tour.“I guess the first time I meet him properly will be at the count,” he said.Richmond and Northallerton is a vast, sprawling rural seat, the second biggest in land area in England. But what is going on there is reflected elsewhere in that suddenly Labour – always seen as an industrial or metropolitan party – is speaking to the rural vote as well.Wilson with Labour activists at Catterick garrison (Tom Wilson)In Norfolk South West, Mr Sunak’s predecessor Liz Truss is fighting for her political life and just last week the prime minister took his battle bus to Sir Geoffrey Cox’s seat in west Devon which had a majority of more than 25,000. One of the MRP polls, in fact, had blue East Anglia painted almost entirely red last week.Sir Keir Starmer has become the first Labour leader to don his wellies and tramp into Tory farmland territory proclaiming “rural communities are in my DNA”.It is a change that Mr Wilson senses as well. He has found that there are deep concerns about services in traditional Tory heartlands like his constituency, not least the closure of a hospital which will force people to travel to Newcastle or Leeds for treatment. It perhaps sums up most of all why Labour is picking up votes in rural communities.“There is a bubbling undercurrent of quite poor people in vulnerable situations in this constituency – being rural magnifies every problem,” he said.“Because not only have you got to worry about whether the ambulance can get to you on time, it’s also that you’re so much further away from the hospital when you take a stumble or when an elderly relative lives in a tiny little village in the dales – there’s a real concern there that they’re not going to get the treatment they need.A local farmer puts Labour posters up on his barn to support Wilson against Sunak (Tom Wilson)“And because it’s rural, you can't always guarantee that you can live near your family. And so there’s, yeah, there’s this huge discontent.”Mr Wilson said the surge in support for candidates like him is often based on “hope”.“People seeming to lose hope seems to be a running theme in this election, and being able to present your ideas for a kind of credible plan to help them directly, and just giving people that time, you can start to see people maybe rediscover a bit of that hope,” he said.After 4 July, Mr Wilson very much hopes that he will be the new MP for Richmond and Northallerton but admits he sometimes wonders if he is “daydreaming”.“It’s quite incredible, isn’t it? But if you get too lost daydreaming about it, then it’ll never happen.“The fact that it seems to be in the range of possibilities is motivating. Like I say, a lot of people have thoroughly been consigned to the Tories always winning, and now think that this is an opportunity for change, not just here in the prime minister’s seat, but across the country.“No voter fits easily the kind of boxes or demographics that the national analysis of elections tends to put people into. Everyone’s their own individual, they all have their own priorities and their own issues.”The prime minister’s campaign missteps have also had an impact on his local seat, not least the anger over him returning early from the D-Day commemorations with Catterick garrison based in the seat.But for Mr Wilson, who works for the NHS, it was the way David Cameron and George Osborne’s austerity in the coalition government thwarted his dreams of becoming a musician that got him into politics.“When I was a teenager I wanted to become a musician, first and foremost, and I was learning how to play the drums and bass guitar at a music centre in Darlington. But in the Cameron era the local council suddenly had a black hole of however many tens of thousands of pounds.”He became involved in a campaign to save the centre and when that was not possible “it became a fundraising campaign with the local councillors across the board. Then it was very shortly after that that first I joined the Labour Party.”He has, though, very much got the election bug whatever the result.Mr Wilson added: “I’ve really enjoyed it, naturally, the experience of being a candidate and talking to people, where they may open up to a candidate in a way that they don’t open up to your average campaigner or your canvasser. It gives you such a window into people’s lives.”"
