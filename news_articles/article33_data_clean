The term is also sometimes used to refer to the election itself, as in ‘they could not win at the ballot box’.CampaignThe time before an election in which politicians persuade people to vote for them. In the case of the 2024 election in the UK, parliament was dissolved on the 30 May and the election will take place on 4 July.CanvassingGoing round a particular area trying to persuade people to vote for one party or the other.In UK elections, this is often done by volunteers knocking on people’s doors.Capital gains taxCapital gains tax is a tax on profit when people sell assets that have increased in value.In the 2024 election, the Conservatives have promised that landlords who sell to sitting tenants will be spared capital gains tax on the proceeds, while Labour has left the door open to raising capital gains.Child benefitChild benefit is a benefit paid to parents with children under 16 (or under 20 in approved education or training).The Conservatives have promised to increase the threshold at which high earners start to lose the benefit from £60,000 to £120,000.Sir Keir Starmer, like the Conservatives, has pledged not to raise VAT.

For example, both the 2010 election and 2017 elections resulted in hung parliament.In 2010, the Conservatives formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, while in 2017, the Conservatives formed a minority government with a 'confidence and supply' agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).Income tax thresholdThe thresholds between the tax-free allowance, basic rate tax and higher rates of tax.Both parties have said they will continue the freeze on income tax thresholds brought in under the Conservatives, which means people pay more tax as more and more people are pushed into higher tax brackets if wages rise.MajorityA party with a majority – more than half of the seats in the House of Commons – has won the election.The number of votes by which an individual MP wins a constituency is also referred to as their majority.ManifestoPolitical parties publish manifestos before a general election, with a set of policies that the party stands for and aims to implement if elected.Manifesto pledges are not legally binding.Marginal seatA seat in which the incumbent MP won by a small majority, meaning a swing is more likely than in a so-called ‘safe seat’ where the MP had a large majority.Net zeroThe UK Government has set a goal for Britain’s emissions to reach net zero – where emission and removal of greenhouse gases reaches equilibrium – by 2050.All major parties are expected to stick to this goal, barring Reform UK.Opinion pollAn opinion poll is a research survey (usually carried out on a representative sample of the electorate) to gauge likely results in an election.Poll‘The polls’ refers to the places where people vote in an election: exit polls and opinion polls refer to two kinds of survey used to predict election results.Postal voteAn absentee vote where the vote is sent in by post.At the 2019 general election, 17.2% of voters across the UK used a postal ballot.Proxy voteA vote where a person who can’t make it to the booth appoints someone to vote for them.In the 2019 election, 0.6% of voters appointed a proxy.PsephologyPsephology is the scientific study of elections and voting and is used to predict and analyse election results.Polling dayThe day when the country places their vote: in the UK 2024 election, this is July 4.PurdahBefore British elections, the country enters purdah, officially known as the ‘pre-election period of sensitivity’.Purdah means that politicians (both local and national) and other people such as civil servants face restrictions on what they can do and announce.Ministers who remain in office can’t announce new funding, or new policies, or anything which might sway voters or make the government more popular.The idea is that public money cannot be spent on the election.Spoiled ballotA ballot paper which has been marked wrongly (for instance with a vote for more than one candidate) will not be counted.Sometimes people spoil ballots deliberately as a protest vote to show dissatisfactionSwing‘Swing’ is the change in voter support for a political party between one election and the next.It is used to analyse the performance of parties in different areas.Tax burdenThe tax burden refers to the total amount of taxes paid by a group (in this case the UK as a whole) as a proportion of total income.The tax burden is currently at its highest in 70 years according to the OECD.The Equality ActThe 2010 Equality Act protects people against discrimination in Britain.The Conservatives want to ‘tweak’ the Act so that sex-based protections only apply on the basis of someone’s biological sex.Triple lockThe triple lock is a guarantee introduced to the state pension in 2010 so it would not lose value in real terms.The guarantee means that the state pension will rise by the highest out of average earnings, inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) or 2.5%.Triple lock plusThe ‘triple lock plus’ is a Conservative policy, which would see the tax-free pension allowance rise every year in line with the triple lock of average wages, inflation, or 2.5% – whichever is highest, to prevent pensioners being pulled into paying income tax.TurnoutTurnout refers to the percentage of people eligible to vote who turn out to vote on election day.In the 2019 election, for example, 67.3% of those eligible turned out to vote.VATValue added tax is added to goods and services sold by VAT-registered companies, and is the third-largest source of government income after income tax and national insurance.Both Labour and the Conservatives have pledged not to raise VAT.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

The Guardian,Thousands fear they will lose vote in UK election after postal ballot delays,[],"Lisa O'Carroll, Caroline Bannock and Rachel Obordo",1 July 2024 at 11:27 am·4-min read,1,July,2024,11:27:00,4,"Thousands of people fear they will be unable to vote in the general election with delays, human error and Brexit being blamed for missing postal ballot packs in the UK and abroad.Clarissa Killwick, a British citizen living in Italy, said she could not trust the post to deliver her vote in time.“I decided to leave nothing to chance and will be going to the UK to vote in person,” said Killwick, who runs a Brexit campaign group for UK citizens in Italy.Another said they had to courier their ballot back to the UK.Vienna-based Michael Goldrei said Hackney council in London told him his pack had been posted on 17 June but he started to panic when it had not arrived a week later. It eventually arrived on 26 June. Goldrei said he was “determined that my vote was counted” so he sent it back via DHL at a cost of €45 (£38). “But will others do that?”Peter Moore has been posting his vote from France for 14 years and blamed Brexit for this year’s delays. “Prior to Brexit, a letter between UK and France took two or three days … since Brexit, it now usually takes a week for a letter to arrive.”He is worried there will not be enough time to guarantee the delivery of his vote.Bruce Darrington, who is the chair of the British Overseas Voters Forum and lives in Bangkok, said he feared a high number of postal votes would not reach the UK in time.The group has partnered with Unlock Democracy and New Europeans UK to investigate people’s experiences this year and come up with solutions for the Electoral Commission.“At the moment, thousands of people could be putting their votes into postboxes around the world and thinking ‘job done’,” said Tom Brake, a former Liberal Democrat MP and the director of Unlock Democracy. “But in reality their vote could be arriving in the UK weeks after polls have closed and never be counted.”New Europeans UK and Unlock Democracy have urged the UK to consider setting up “overseas constituencies”, which would allow British people to place their vote in the country they live in. Seventeen countries including France, Italy, Portugal and Romania operate overseas constituencies.Delays have also been reported in Scotland and England. Postal voters constitute more than a fifth of the electorate.Most schools in Scotland broke up for the summer holidays at the end of June and many people who had hoped to vote by post are on holiday. The first minister, John Swinney, said the problem highlighted that no consideration had been made for Scottish term dates when the election was called.Edinburgh city council set up an emergency facility for lost and delayed postal votes at the weekend with a unit providing replacement documentation in the city chambers open from 9am to 5pm each day until the election. Voters are asked to bring photo ID.A spokesperson said it had issued 370 replacements over the weekend. It had originally sent out 103,581 postal packs. Fife council and Glasgow city council have opened similar facilities.Malcolm Burr, the convener of the electoral management board for Scotland, said that for postal voting to be a “viable option” returning officers “must rely on print suppliers and a predictable and reliable service from Royal Mail”.There are also problems in England. The leader of Uttlesford district council in north-west Essex said 2,644 postal ballots went out nine days late owing to “human error” during the oversight of printing.The council said anyone who had not received their ballot pack by Monday should call the council on 01799 510 510 to request a reissue of their ballot paper, which would then be hand-delivered.Those who are worried the delay may mean the ballot will not reach the electoral officers on time can submit the pack by hand at the council offices or at any polling station on election day.Southwark council in London has identified problems with postal votes in the SE22 area. A spokesperson said they had “raised this at a senior level with Royal Mail”, which was confident it would deliver all outstanding ballot packs in time.The Electoral Commission has said it will investigate the problem fully after the election."

The Telegraph,Royal Mail criticised for failing to deliver postal votes before election,['Downing Street denies that delays will affect results'],Madeleine Ross,1 July 2024 at 1:13 pm·7-min read,1,July,2024,01:13:00,7,"Royal Mail has been criticised by the postal minister for failing to deliver votes in time for the general election.Postal vote delays across the country have forced Royal Mail to scramble to ensure that ballots are counted in time for the general election.Extra staff are being drafted in to work on election night to make sure that ballots are collected from postal sorting offices and reach counts before polls close at 10pm on Thursday.The Telegraph has discovered that voters in more than 90 constituencies, including those of Cabinet ministers, have raised concerns about their ballots failing to arrive.Delayed postal votes can risk some people not being able to cast their ballot if they are not returned on time or if their papers are never received.It is understood that there are several factors behind the delays, including the short turnaround time for councils to process applications, problems with printers and issues with Royal Mail deliveries.The crisis is fuelling fears among candidates that delays may cost them election on Thursday.Voters in more than 90 constituencies have raised concerns about ballot delivery - Toby Melville/ReutersKevin Hollinrake, the postal affairs minister, criticised Royal Mail for failing to anticipate the demand, saying: “We urge Royal Mail to do all they can to make sure that postal votes get to the right people at the right time, and time is completely of the essence now.“There’s a resourcing issue. They have recruited extra people and I welcome that but they’ve got to make sure they’ve got the right number of people to deliver the mail at busy times like this.“It’s not acceptable it’s sat in sorting offices. It needs to be delivered to people’s houses. So they need to put more people on to do that.”He added: “I don’t think there’s an issue here other than Royal Mail being competent and fulfilling their obligations under the USO [Universal Service Obligation].“If people want to choose to vote by post, that’s perfectly fine. In my view, certainly from a logistical point of view, that should be something that’s available to anyone who wants to do that.”Mr Hollinrake said that he had been made aware of problems in his own constituency of Thirsk and Malton, where he is defending a majority of 25,154.Kevin Hollinrake has criticised the postal service after concerns about delays to the delivery of postal votes - Thomas Krych/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockA Royal Mail source said: “We’ll be carrying out sweeps at our mail centres and delivery offices to ensure all postal votes in the network are identified and returned to the relevant local authority before the close of poll stations.“We will also have additional people on the ground in our mail centres on Thursday evening, identifying and pulling postal votes for delivery to local authorities.”One candidate is already warning that the chaos could cost them their chance of winning.Luke Graham, the Conservative candidate in Perth and Kinross-shire, said more than 20 voters had told him they had not received their papers before embarking on their summer holidays.Mr Graham, whose prospective seat was won by the SNP by 21 votes in 2017, said: “It absolutely could be the difference between winning or losing.”The Telegraph has identified at least 91 constituencies where voters are affected, including 76 in England, 12 in Scotland and three in Wales.Kemi Badenoch, Grant Shapps and James Cleverly are among Cabinet ministers whose constituents have raised concerns about postal vote delays.Mr Cleverly, the Home Secretary, said that “some people” in his Essex constituency of Braintree had not yet received their forms.Mr Cleverly, who is defending a majority of 24,673, said it was not clear if the delays were part of a pattern but urged voters to “chase up” any missing ballots.He told The Telegraph: “What I would say to people is that, if they haven’t received their postal ballot, if they’re expecting one, to get in contact with their local authority, to really chase this up.“Everyone should have the right to vote, and people should look to exercise their democratic right.”Completed postal votes must be delivered by 10pm on Thursday, when they will be counted - Ian Forsyth/GettyDowning Street denies that delays will affect resultsDowning Street played down the issue on Monday, with the Prime Minister’s official spokesman saying they were “aware of some concerns” but denying the delays could affect results in marginal seats.An estimated 10 million people are thought to have opted to cast their ballot by post this year, accounting for between 20 and 25 per cent of the vote.Postal voting was introduced for UK elections in 2001, and has increased in popularity from 4.9 per cent to 21 per cent of votes – 6.7 million – in 2019.The deadline to apply to vote by post in Thursday’s poll was June 19. Voters could apply for their postal ballot to be resent to them no more than four days before the election if it had not arrived, and are able to personally hand in their votes at a polling station.If voters have not yet sent their postal ballot, they can take it to a polling station on July 4, although they will be asked for their date of birth, postcode and National Insurance or passport number before they will be able to vote.Those who do not receive ballots in time, or who cannot hand them into a polling station on Thursday, will not be able to cast their vote.There were warnings from senior election officials as early as last year that the electoral system would be unable to cope with increasing demand for postal voting.In a review of the May 2023 local elections, the  Association of Electoral Administrators, which represents returning officers, who are responsible for making sure elections run smoothly, warned about problems with postal votes.Many returning officers were having to deal with delivery problems, the report said, and “significant numbers” of voters had not received their ballots, which caused “upset”.Its chief executive, Peter Stanyon, said: “It’s symptomatic of the challenge of delivering postal votes in a very constrained timetable.“It is getting harder and harder and this time round we are expecting in the region of 10 million postal votes to have been issued for the general election.  That is up by more than 1.5 million on the last time around, which was a winter election.”The Electoral Commission told The Telegraph last week that problems with the postal voting system would be included in its post-election review.Postal votes are counted in the Kingswood by-election earlier this year. Voters can also hand postal votes in to their polling station - Carl Court/GettyAn Electoral Commission spokesman in Scotland confirmed that tens of thousands of postal votes had been delivered to Scottish voters over the weekend. The spokesman continued: “We know local authorities and Royal Mail are working to get the final ones out as soon as possible.”A Royal Mail spokesman said that it has a specialist elections team and that it was working closely with local authorities in order to get ballots to voters in time. They said: “We have no backlog of postal votes. Where concerns have been raised, we have investigated and confirmed ballot packs are being delivered as soon as they arrive in our network.”A Local Government Association spokesman said: “Councils and electoral staff across the country have been doing their utmost to ensure the smooth running of this election and that people can vote.“People voting by post are expected to have increased 20 per cent since the 2019 General elections, with more than 1.3 million postal vote applications made between 22 May and 19 June. This unprecedented increase adds more pressure to an already complex process and overburdened system.“We are aware of reports of incidents where delays have happened. The postal vote system could benefit from review and more could be done to support Royal Mail and printers to be ready to deliver elections.”"
The Telegraph,Starmer suggests he won’t work past 6pm on Fridays,[],Daniel Martin,1 July 2024 at 11:55 am·3-min read,1,July,2024,11:55:00,3,"Sir Keir Starmer has been accused of planning to be a “part-time prime minister” after suggesting he would want to finish work at 6pm on Fridays.The Labour leader said that on the last working day of the week he does “not do a work-related thing after 6pm pretty well come what may”, saying he wanted to protect time spent with his family.He added that he planned to maintain the habit if his party was to be elected on Thursday.Sir Keir told Virgin Radio: “We’ve had a strategy in place and we’ll try to keep to it, which is to carve out really protected time for the kids. So on a Friday – I’ve been doing this for years – I will not do a work-related thing after six o’clock, pretty well come what may.“There are a few exceptions, but that’s what we do.”He added: “In politics, some people think if you fill your diary 24/7 and don’t do anything else, that makes you a much better decision-maker. I don’t agree with that.“I don’t believe in the theory that you’re a better decision-maker if you don’t allow yourself the space to be a dad and have fun with your kids.“Actually, it helps me. It takes me away from the pressure, it relaxes me and I think actually, not only is that what I want to do as a dad, it is better.”A spokesman for the Labour leader said: “Obviously he recognises things will be different if he does end up in No 10.”Asked about the remarks, Rishi Sunak said he had never finished at 6pm and that clocking off so early would not leave enough time to do the job properly.“What I would say is – what time is it now? – I haven’t finished at 6pm ever,” the Prime Minister said on Monday afternoon.“We would only have a couple of hours left in the day at this point, which is not great.”The comments may raise fears of his party’s workers’ rights agenda, under which employees will have a legal right to flexible working.A Conservative Party attack on social media said: “Keir Starmer has said he’d clock off work at 6pm if he became prime minister.“You deserve better than a part-time prime minister. The only way to prevent this is to vote Conservative on Thursday.”Meanwhile, a Tory source told The Sun: “Whether he likes it or not, if he became PM, Sir Sleepy would be required to work after 6pm. If he thinks he can just put his slippers on and make a mug of Horlicks while he tunes into The One Show, then he is in for a shock.”Tory sources have previously called the 61-year-old Labour leader “Sleepy Keir”, suggesting that he cannot keep up with 44-year-old Mr Sunak.Sir Keir says he uses Friday evenings to spend time with his wife, Victoria, and their children - Stefan Rousseau/PA WireThe Labour leader and his wife, Victoria, have a 16-year-old son and a 13-year-old daughter, whom he says are his “pride and joy”.Last week he vowed never to use them in photo opportunities, telling ITV: “This is a very impactful time and that’s why we’re fiercely protective of them and we will continue to be.“So, don’t expect any photos of us with the children or using the children in any way to campaign.”He has also not publicly named them in an attempt to protect their privacy.Sir Keir also suggested his children appeared unimpressed with his political career, saying that after winning a politician of the year award from The Spectator, his son asked: “How did you blag that, then?”Meanwhile, when he was speaking at a fundraising dinner, Sir Keir’s daughter asked: “Why would anyone pay to hear you speak?”“They keep me very, very grounded,” he added."
Yahoo News UK,"Who is Richard Tice? Reform’s former leader turned Farage sidekickThe candidate for Hartlepool has seen his party's popularity swell in recent months, with one poll showing reform ahead of the Conservatives.",[],Andrew Naughtie,Updated 14 June 2024 at 4:45 am·6-min read,14,June,2024,04:45:00,6,"Now that Nigel Farage has taken over as the leader of Reform UK, Richard Tice’s public profile is fading fast - but the Reform chairman remains involved in the party's operations.So far, the party has only one MP, Conservative defector Lee Anderson. But a recent poll has shown Reform overtaking the Tories, raising the possibility Anderson could hold his seat and even end up with fellow Reformers in the next Parliament.As the candidate for Hartlepool, where he stood as the Brexit Party candidate in 2019, Tice hopes to be one of them. So who is he, and what does he stand for?Childhood and educationBorn in Surrey in 1964 to James Tice, a showjumper, and Joan Tice, a horse trainer. Educated at the private boarding school Uppingham, he studied at the University of Salford, gaining a degree in construction economics and quantity surveying – teeing him up for a career that he said would ""continue the family genes in the property industry"".Family (partner & kids)Tice has three children from a 24-year marriage that ended in divorce. He is now in a long-term relationship with the right-wing writer and journalist Isabel Oakeshott.She is perhaps best known for two notorious incidents that set her against leading Tories: a book that featured the heavily disputed allegation that David Cameron had engaged in sexual activity with a pig, and the release of embarrassing messages entrusted to her by Matt Hancock when she agreed to write a book with him.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election? Full list mappedThe key issues that will decide the electionWhen is the first UK general election TV debate?What is purdah? The strict rule that governs what politicians can and can't sayNet worthWhile not quite in the same league as Rishi Sunak, Tice is one of the wealthiest people in British politics. As he describes it on his website, he made his multi-million-pound fortune over the course of “30 years of making things happen in property investment”, starting with a graduate job at a London firm in 1987.According to Tice, the company he leads as CEO, Quidnet Capital, has “bought and managed £500 million in commercial properties across the UK on behalf of clients”.He was also a key figure in the redevelopment of London’s Nine Elms district, near Battersea Power Station, a controversial project that has transformed a stretch of the Thames’s south bank with a welter of rapidly erected high-rise blocks.GB News linksAlong with Nigel Farage, Lee Anderson and several MPs on the right flank of the Tory party, Tice is a regular on the hard-right, culture war-focused TV outlet GB News. There he hosts a programme called “Richard Tice’s Sunday Sermon”, which serves as a platform for him to deliver his political analysis without the interruptions of an interviewer.However, despite the network being a relatively safe space for him in ideological terms, Tice’s appearances aren’t always amicable. A recent interview with host Andrew Pierce, a longtime right-wing commentator, saw him challenged fiercely about Reform’s chances in a summer election should one be called – with Pierce pointing to the “weirdos” selected by the party to fight numerous seats as evidence the party is “not ready”.Richard Tice, pictured in 2018 at a 'Leave Means Leave' campaign event, is focused on the issue of immigration. (Steve Finn/WENN)Tice was also involved in an incident that saw the network deemed in breach of broadcasting regulator Ofcom’s impartiality regulations, specifically an interview in which a former Brexit Party MEP failed to “sufficiently challenge” his views on immigration.The regulator is under increasing pressure to crack down on GB News heading into the election, with critics arguing it cannot be allowed to broadcast shows that feature Tory and Reform MPs interviewing each other without alternative points of view represented.Tice on NHSThe state and future of the NHS set to be one of this election’s main battlegrounds, and Reform’s key health policy is to spend £17 billion on the NHS on top of its current budget in an effort to get waiting lists down to zero. It also proposes introducing tax relief on private healthcare – something that has been criticised by opponents as a creeping step towards the privatisation of healthcare writ large.Tice’s stated rationale is that the reason the service is struggling is because the money it needs is being spent on other things that the public do not in fact support. Top of the list is Net Zero, which the party and its predecessors have long decried as a pointless “woke” project.In April, Tice used a press conference to frame the choice starkly. “We have a choice in this country, it seems to me,” he said. “A pretty clear choice. Do we want zero waiting lists in two years, and to keep them there? That is the Reform choice. Or do we want net zero CO2 emissions in 25 years? That is the Labour choice.”Tice on immigrationImmigration is by far Reform UK’s top issue, with the party looking to build on Farage’s two decades of campaigning against it in its legal and illegal forms.As far as the election goes, Tice and the party are targeting the continuing arrival of small boats of people travelling across the English Channel, many of them seeking asylum. He has criticised the government for failing to stop “mass immigration” post-Brexit, and described Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda policy as “a disaster”, arguing on GB News that its supposed deterrent value was revealed to be zero just hours after the House of Commons finally passed the law.Reform chairman Richard Tice (L) and leader Nigel Farage speak at the party's economic policy launch at Church House in London. (Alamy Live News)“Within a matter of hours more boats, absolutely packed full, overfilled with illegal migrants, were setting off from the beaches. And we learnt on Tuesday morning that sadly five people, including a young child, drowned leaving the beaches. That's not a deterrent. That's an absolute disaster.”Instead of deporting people to Rwanda, he is arguing for a “pick up and take back” policy that would see small boat arrivals deposited back on French soil. As evidence that this is both practical and humane, he has cited similar policies deployed in the US and Australia.However, he has not addressed the fact that Australia’s policy has been criticised internationally for leaving so-called “boat people” confined to facilities on the island of Nauru, where there have been incidents of suicide and self-immolation.Tice on cost of living crisisPerhaps unsurprisingly given he is trying to peel away former Tory voters, Tice has criticised recent Tory prime ministers harshly for overseeing Britain’s intense cost of living crisis. In 2022, he accused then-prime minister Boris Johnson of “waffling” over the situation. “Clueless, out of touch, no ideas, no help,” he tweeted. “Shocking.”He has also warned that the prospect of a “disastrous” Labour government will offer no prospect of meaningful relief for struggling households.Instead, Reform proposes lifting the minimum level of income tax to £20,000 while cutting various other taxes – among them fuel duty, another gesture to the party’s rejection of environmentalism as a top priority."
The Telegraph,Conservative Party manifesto 2024: Rishi Sunak’s policies for the general election,"['NHS and social care', 'Tax and spending', 'Economy', 'Environment', 'Energy and net zero', 'Education and childcare', 'Defence', 'Pensions and welfare', 'Policing and crime', 'Migration', 'Levelling-up']",Nick Gutteridge,1 July 2024 at 11:03 am·16-min read,1,July,2024,11:03:00,16,"With only a few days left until polling day, Rishi Sunak is hoping his pitch to the country – the Conservative manifesto – will help the party pull off a surprise election comeback.The Prime Minister announced his election promises at Silverstone on June 11 under a banner reading “clear plan, bold action, secure future”.The document outlines a further 2 per cent tax cut to National Insurance, the construction of 1.6 million homes over the next Parliament and an increase of the child benefit threshold.Mr Sunak has faced an uphill battle since announcing the snap summer election and is looking to prevent his party from suffering a wipe-out at the hands of Labour, which leads the polls by 20 percentage points.Read the latest election pollsFollow The Telegraph’s general election live coverageBelow, The Telegraph lists the policies the Prime Minister laid out in the 76-page document and what this means for his chances of re-election.NHS and social careTax and spendingEconomyEnvironmentEnergy and ‘Net Zero’Education and childcareDefencePensions and welfarePolicing and crimeMigrationLevelling-UpNHS and social careIncrease NHS spending above inflation each yearDeliver 92,000 more nurses and 28,000 more doctors compared to 2023Deliver 40 new hospitals by 2030Drive up productivity in the NHS and move care closer to people’s homesProvide 2.5 million more NHS dental appointmentsHeadlining the manifesto’s section on health and social care is a pledge to continue to increase NHS spending above inflation in each year of the next parliament.To boost the NHS workforce, the Tories have vowed to deliver 92,000 more nurses and 28,000 more doctors in that time, compared to 2023 levels.The party is standing by Boris Johnson’s controversial pledge to deliver 40 new hospitals by 2030, while investing “proportionately more” in out-of-hospital services over time.It has also vowed to drive up productivity in the NHS and move care closer to people’s homes by utilising pharmacies, new and modernised GP surgeries and more community diagnostic centres.Meanwhile, the party promised to unlock 2.5 million more NHS dental appointments through its Dental Recovery Plan.The manifesto also states that the Tories are committed to supporting a “high-quality and sustainable social care system”, building on existing investment.At the next spending review, the party would give local authorities a “multi-year funding settlement to support social care”.Tax and spendingAbolish national insurance payments for 4m self-employedFurther 2p NI cut for salaried employeesScrap NI entirely “when financial conditions allow”Meet its fiscal rules of public sector net debt fallingReduce public sector net borrowing to below 3 per cent of GDP within five yearsAbolish Stamp Duty on homes worth up to £425,000The Tories have put lower taxes at the heart of their manifesto, with a surprise pledge to abolish National Insurance payments for almost all self-employed people.Mr Sunak said that more than nine in 10 self-employed Brits - some four million workers - would be exempted from the levy under his party’s plans.But under the Tory plans 7 per cent of the highest earning self-employed workers would continue to pay National Insurance.The party would only abolish the main rate of the levy, which is charged at 6 per cent of self-employed earnings between £12,570 and £50,270.An upper rate of 2 per cent, which is applied to profits over £50,270, will remain in place.He said the announcement was “a further downpayment” on the Conservatives’ long-term ambition to abolish the levy entirely.Employee national insurance would also be cut by a further 2p, taking the tax to 6 per cent by April 2027. The party said this would amount to a total tax cut of £1,350 for the average worker on £35,000.It also reiterated its “long-term ambition” to scrap the “double tax on work” entirely when financial conditions allow.The manifesto also includes a pledge to abolish Stamp Duty on homes worth up to £425,000 for first-time buyers and to reintroduce the Help to Buy scheme.EconomyVow not to raise corporation taxEase burden of business rates for high street, leisure and hospitality firmsKeep the VAT threshold “under review”Return the size of the Civil Service to pre-pandemic levels to cut “government bureaucracy”Funnel civil service savings into defenceThe Tories said the “only way to give people peace of mind” that the UK can weather further global shocks is to “get borrowing and debt down”.Therefore, in the next Parliament, the party pledged to continue to meet its fiscal rules of having public sector net debt falling, and for public sector net borrowing to be below 3 per cent of GDP in the fifth year of the forecast.It said the measures in the manifesto are “fully funded” and “would result in lower borrowing in 2029-30”.The Conservatives promised to “always be the party of business”, with a vow not to raise corporation tax. They would also “continue to ease the burden of business rates” for high street, leisure and hospitality firms and keep the VAT threshold “under review”.Read the full 2024 Liberal Democrat manifesto hereMeanwhile, the party pledged to cut “government bureaucracy” by returning the size of the Civil Service to pre-pandemic levels, with the savings funnelled into defence spending.EnvironmentWater bosses to lose bonuses if their firm commits serious criminal breachInvest water company fines in river restoration projectsMore affordable housing for local people in rural areasEmpower councils to manage the growth of holiday letsExpand the UK’s Blue Belt marine conservation schemeNo new restrictions on fox huntingTo combat the sewage crisis blighting Britain’s waterways, the Tories would work with the regulator, Ofwat, to hold companies to account, including banning bonuses for bosses if their firm has committed a serious criminal breach. Proceeds from water companies fines would be used to invest in river restoration projects.The party would cut red tape that “holds back the planting of trees in the planning system”, identifying suitable areas where permits can be streamlined.It would maintain its “record flooding funding” of £5.6 billion over 2021-2027 and champion rural communities by backing farmers with a new legal target for food security.And it would “always stand up for farmers when negotiating new trade deals”.Rishi Sunak greets members of a synagogue in Golders Green, London, on June 30 - James ManningThe Conservatives would boost the availability of affordable housing for local people in rural areas, while ensuring councils have the powers they need to manage “the uncontrolled growth of holiday lets”.Mr Sunak has also vowed not to introduce any new restrictions on fox hunting after Labour said it would ban all forms of hunting with hounds if he wins.He promised not to make any changes to the Hunting Act introduced by Sir Tony Blair in 2004, in a pitch to traditional Tory heartlands.Read the full 2024 Labour manifesto hereThe Tories would consult UK overseas territories on further expanding the Blue Belt programme, the UK’s flagship marine conservation scheme.And the party remains committed to banning the import of hunting trophies and tackling puppy smuggling and livestock worrying.Energy and net zeroCut consumers’ costs by taking a “more pragmatic approach” to the transitionLower green levies on household billsPut forward a vote in Parliament for any new net zero targetNo new green levies or frequent flyer chargeNorth Sea licensing rounds to continue annuallyTreble Britain’s offshore wind capacity and support solar energy “in the right places”The Tories’ central pledge on net zero is to cut the cost for consumers by taking a “more pragmatic approach” to the transition, with green levies on household bills lower in each year of the next Parliament than they were in 2023.The “next stage” of the roadmap would be put to a vote in Parliament, with any new target subject to “proper consideration of the plans and policies required”, in order to “maintain democratic consent for the big decisions that net zero will mean for our country”.The party would reform the Climate Change Committee, giving it an “explicit mandate to consider cost to households and UK energy security” in its future advice.It also ruled out creating any new green levies or a frequent flyer charge.North Sea licensing rounds would continue on an annual basis, in contrast to Labour’s policy. Meanwhile, the Tories would aim to treble Britain’s offshore wind capacity and support solar “in the right places” - crucially “not on our best agricultural land”.It also pledges to look at burying pylons underground and guaranteeing a parliamentary vote on the next stages of the “pathway” of net zero.Education and childcareBan mobile phones during the school dayEnsure parents see what their children are being taught in schoolsTransform post-16 education with new “Advanced British Standard”Create 100,000 apprenticeships by 2029New teachers in priority areas to get bonuses of up to £30k tax-free over five yearsThe Tories would ban mobile phones during the school day and ensure parents can see what their children are being taught, especially on “sensitive matters like sex education”.The party would aim to “transform” post-16 education by introducing a new Advanced British Standard, bringing together academic A-levels and technical T-levels.It has also pledged to create a further 100,000 apprenticeships by 2029, paid for by scrapping “poor quality” degrees.Both primary and secondary schools would be required to deliver two hours of PE every week. To boost recruitment, new teachers in priority areas and sought-after subjects would receive bonuses of up to £30,000 tax-free over five years from September 2024.The Prime Minister’s flagship campaign promise to bring back national service also features in the manifesto.Under the mandatory scheme, 18-year-olds would have to enrol in the military for a year or spend one weekend each month volunteering in their community.DefenceBring back national service for school leaversIncrease military budget to 2.5 per cent of GDP by end of the decade£3 billion in support every year for Ukraine until 2030Introduce a Veterans’ Bill that gives employers tax breaks for hiring themIn his first major policy announcement of the election campaign, Mr Sunak vowed to bring back national service for school leavers, which would open military placements to 30,000 youngsters with residential stays at army barracks or other military facilities.The Conservatives hope the policy will set them apart from Labour as they seek to present themselves as the only party that can be trusted with the UK’s security and defence with multiple threats facing Britain and the world.Mr Sunak warned in a speech in May that a Labour victory represented a threat to UK security.The Prime Minister announced his party would hike the military budget to 2.5 per cent of GDP by the end of the decade - a commitment Labour has failed to match.He also committed to at least £3 billion in support every year for Ukraine until 2030, with both pledges reinforced in the election manifesto.In a major speech at the Policy Exchange think tank on May 13, Mr Sunak argued that Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, would be emboldened by Labour not matching his promise to raise defence spending to 2.5 per cent by 2030.It comes with concerns having been raised about the size of the Army, Navy and Air Force and their struggle to attract enough new recruits.In a tribute to Armed Forces personnel, Mr Sunak will also introduce a Veterans’ Bill to give employers tax breaks for hiring “heroes who have put their lives on the line” and cut the price of rail travel for them.Elsewhere, the Tories pledged to declare China a risk to UK security on a par with Russia and Iran if they win the election.They have committed to adding China to the “enhanced tier” of the UK’s foreign influence registration scheme, meaning all Chinese individuals acting on behalf of the nation would face heightened scrutiny.Pensions and welfare“Quadruple lock” state pension that will never be taxedKeep winter fuel payments, free TV licences and bus passes for pensionersCrackdown on Britain’s welfare billOverhaul sick notes to get more people back into workTougher sanctions for those able to seek work but choose not toMr Sunak declared on May 27 that the state pension will never be taxed under the Conservatives as he unveiled a so-called quadruple lock.The manifesto also promises to keep all other pensioner perks including winter fuel payments, free TV licences and bus passes in place.It adds: “We are carefully considering the Ombudsman report into WASPI women and will work with Parliament to provide an appropriate and swift response.”At the same time it takes a completely different approach when it comes to benefits, with a crackdown on Britain’s ballooning welfare bill set out.The manifesto includes an overhaul of sick notes to get more people back into work and tougher sanctions for those who are able to seek work but choose not to.Policing and crimeTougher sentencing for knife crimeBuild four new jails by 2030, providing 20,000 extra prison placesRecruit an extra 8,000 police officersNew mandatory 25-year sentences for domestic abuse murdersNew police powers to ban protests that pose a risk of serious disorderBan protests outside schoolsThe election campaign will see Mr Sunak and Sir Keir battle it out for who can sound the toughest when it comes to cracking down on crime.Labour has banged the drum on lower-level offences like burglary and antisocial behaviour, painting a picture of a lawless Britain where neighbourhoods live in fear.The Prime Minister has come under pressure to match that rhetoric with harsher sentences for petty criminals and more community payback schemes.His manifesto includes a crackdown on knife crime with tougher sentencing, allowing the Tories to target Sadiq Khan’s record in London.The Tories also pledge to build four new jails by 2030, providing 20,000 extra prison places so that more criminals can be locked up for longer.The dossier also includes a commitment to recruit an extra 8,000 police officers dedicated specifically to tackling neighbourhood crime in a £650 million plan that would take the total number of officers in the UK to its highest level ever at 180,000.And it states that the Tories will “toughen up community sentencing by increasing the use of community payback and electronic tagging, so criminals pay their debt to society and communities witness justice being served”.Elsewhere it contains new mandatory 25-year sentences for domestic abuse murders and commits to a wider review of homicide sentencing which could lead to the creation of US-style first and second-degree murder, increasing the minimum sentence for murders in the home from 15 to 25 years.Find out how Reform UK’s full manifesto comparesThe manifesto also says police will get new powers to ban protests or marches that pose a risk of serious disorder. Chief constables would be able to block marches due to the “cumulative” disruption and “persistent” threats to public order. Police could also be able to recover the costs of policing protests from groups that organised them.Protests outside schools would also be banned to “stop mobs from intimidating teachers and children”. Teachers would be given legal protection from blasphemy accusations following cases such as the Batley school cartoon row where a teacher was forced into hiding.Police and prosecutors would be placed under a new legal duty to publish regular guidance on the statements, chants or symbols, such as the swastika or the term “jihad”, that in the context of political protest may constitute an offence.MigrationBring in a “binding, legal” annual cap on immigrationAnnual vote in Parliament on the visa cap figureLegal migrants must undergo a health check before getting a visaRaise skilled workers’ salary requirements in line with inflation each yearRemove illegal migrants to Rwanda, with monthly flights, starting in July, until the boats are stoppedSign further returns deals similar to the agreement with AlbaniaMr Sunak has been under huge pressure from his own MPs to go into the next election on a cast-iron promise to dramatically cut net migration.The manifesto includes a commitment to bring in a “binding, legal” annual cap on immigration visas but does not say at what number it would be set.Instead Parliament would get an annual vote on the visa cap figure, which would be recommended by the Government’s migration advisers.Legal migrants would be required to undergo a health check before getting a visa as part of a plan to reduce the cost to the NHS of those arriving with conditions.The manifesto also includes a commitment to raise the salary requirements for skilled workers in line with inflation every year “to make sure they don’t undercut UK workers”.On stopping the small boats, it says: “We will run a relentless, continual process of permanently removing illegal migrants to Rwanda with a regular rhythm of flights every month, starting this July, until the boats are stopped.”The manifesto also commits the Government to “sign further returns deals like the one we have already agreed with Albania”.It also says the party will work with other countries to “rewrite” asylum treaties to make them fit for the “challenges” of illegal migration.But it stops short of pledging a referendum on leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, as demanded by some Tory MPs.Instead it only opens the door to the possibility of leaving the convention by vowing to put the security of UK borders ahead of membership of a foreign court.Levelling-upGive 30 towns across UK £20 million eachCreate more freeports and continue backing investment zonesRevitalise high streets by changing planning lawsMake chewing gum manufacturers pay for street cleaningMr Sunak has pledged to give 30 towns across the UK £20 million each in an expansion of the party’s levelling-up policy.The Prime Minister claimed the methodology used to select the towns – including Tamworth, Bognor Regis, Flint, Perth and Newry – had been used “multiple times before” based on “levelling-up needs, looking at economic opportunity, skills, health and life expectancy”.He claimed towns were “neglected” under a previous Labour government and added: “I’m not going to make any apology for supporting towns.“Crucially, it will be local people in all those areas that are in charge of how to spend that money, to make sure it’s spent and invested on their priorities - an example of us levelling up everywhere, backing local people and their priorities, and giving them the long-term funding and assurance to do so,” he said.The manifesto also includes pledges to create more freeports, where businesses get tax breaks for investing, and to continue backing investment zones.Elsewhere it features a commitment to revitalise high streets by changing planning laws and making chewing gum manufacturers pay for street cleaning.“We will change planning laws to support places to bring back local market days and regenerate defunct shopping centres,” it says."

Some three-quarters of the Cabinet would lose their seats in that scenario – including Sunak.Were Sunak to lose his seat in Richmond (Yorks), it would make him the first prime minister in history to lose their seat in a general election, according to the Institute for Government. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is also facing a battle to hold on to his constituency, with the vote on a “knife edge”.Savanta spoke to around 18,000 people between 7 June and 18 June for their poll. If reflected in the election, Labour would be on course to win 516 seats, with a commanding Commons majority of 382. The Liberal Democrats would have nearly as many seats (50) as the Tories.Jeremy Hunt: My constituency is on a knife edgeHunt could be among the Conservative casualties on the night of the 4 July poll, despite his newly-created seat in Godalming and Ash currently holding a Conservative majority of more than 10,000. He is facing a battle to win the seat in Surrey, with the Liberal Democrats keen on taking a high-profile scalp.Several other Tory ‘big beasts’ also face a tight vote to hold onto their seat, according to a major poll by Ipsos.Grant ShappsDefence secretary Grant Shapps may lose his seat in the election.

(PA)Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons, is another Tory MP whose name has been mentioned in a future leadership contest – in the event of the Tories losing the election. However, she may not even be an MP after 4 July as her Portsmouth North seat is at risk.Seen as “leaning Labour”, polling suggests Labour are on 42%, compared to the Tories on 34%. She won 61.4% of the vote in the 2019 election.Liz TrussFormer prime minister Liz Truss may not be an MP after the election. (PA)Former prime minister Liz Truss is at risk in her South West Norfolk seat. The seat is seen as a “toss up”, with Truss currently in the lead at 31%. Labour are a sitting at 27% but Reform UK are polling 30%.Allowing for margins of error and another two weeks of campaigning, the seat will be hotly contested between all three parties on 4 July.Jacob Rees-MoggJacob Rees-Mogg is on track to lose his seat at the general election. (PA)While no longer a government minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg losing his North East Somerset and Hanham seat would perhaps be one of the night’s bigger surprises. Rees-Mogg has been an outspoken critic of some of Sunak’s policies and is a regular presenter on GB News.However, the Ipsos poll has the seat, which has been newly-created for the 2024 election, is currently showing a “likely Labour” win, with the party on 47%, compared to 30% for the Conservatives.Johnny MercerPolling suggests Johnny Mercer will lose his seat to Labour at the election.

Yahoo News UK,"3 electoral maps that show how disastrous the election could be for the ToriesWith new modelling predicting a Labour victory even bigger than Tony Blair's 1997 landslide, the outlook for Rishi Sunak is not looking good.",['Which Tory ministers are at risk of losing their seats?'],James Cheng-Morris and  James Hockaday,Updated 5 June 2024 at 6:34 am·4-min read,5,June,2024,06:34:00,4,"The outlook was already looking bleak for the Conservative Party when Rishi Sunak called the general election following months of dismal approval ratings that showed little sign of improving.At a campaign event last week, Sunak said he didn't think defeat to Labour was a ""foregone conclusion"", suggesting his main election rival Sir Keir Starmer was taking the British electorate ""for granted"".However, a general election projection released on Monday will have added to the Tories' woes – predicting the biggest win for Labour in the party's history, surpassing even that of Tony Blair's 1997 landslide.The analysis, carried out by YouGov for Sky News, used a relatively new polling technique called Multi-level Regression and Post-stratification (MRP), which is regarded to have had a good track record and can provide detailed predictions at a constituency level basis. The scale of Sunak's problems is demonstrated by the interactive maps below, showing just how much ground the Tories are expected to lose compared to their 2019 victory.Click on the arrows in the top left to switch between the two maps. Check your own constituency to see if it is projected to change handsThe first map above shows the seats won in the 2019 general election, when Boris Johnson led the party to a stunning majority.The wall of Tory blue on the map, compared to the spots of Labour red, is a demonstration of just how far Labour, then led by Jeremy Corbyn, had fallen in public standing. The result was Labour's worst electoral performance since 1935.If you toggle to the second map, the projection by YouGov (which was based on polling carried out between 24 May - 1 June) suggests that Starmer's party is on track to win 422 seats, with the Tories down to just 140.Such a result would be the Conservative Party's worst performance at a general election since 1906. If YouGov's predictions are accurate, Labour winning a 194-seat majority would be the highest number since Conservative Stanley Baldwin won a majority of 208 in 1924.The model suggests the Conservatives could be set for near wipeout across many areas of the country, including London, the North East, the North West, and Wales.It also projects that the Scottish National Party would lose more than half their seats, with Labour returning as the largest party north of the border, and the Liberal Democrats reclaiming its place as the third party of British politics – winning 48 seats.The new figures, released yesterday, came as Reform UK co-founder Nigel Farage announced that he would be returning as the populist party's leader and would stand for election in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. Even before Farage's latest bid, pollsters told Yahoo News that Reform UK could pose a serious threat to the Tories by splitting the vote and potentially handing even more seats to Labour.The YouGov projection follows a similar poll by modelling site Electoral Calculus, which came out on 31 May. The polling also compares the 2019 result with Electoral Calculus' projection.It predicts that Labour is on course to win an even bigger majority of 319 seats - with Starmer's party picking up 485 MPs and the Tories way behind with 66. The modelling shows the Lib Dems getting very close to the Conservative Party, with 59 seats.While Electoral Calculus' polling, based on opinion polls from 8 May to 20 May, returns a different set of projections to YouGov's, both clearly indicate the scale of the problem facing Sunak.The Electoral Calculus model has predicted Sir Keir Starmer's Labour will win a massive majority.

The Lib Dem leader whose life has been marked by adversity,"['His early life', 'His family', 'His parents', 'His education', 'Why is he a Sir?']",Hannah Fearn,Updated 1 July 2024 at 0:04 pm·3-min read,1,July,2024,00:04:00,3,"The youngest of three boys, Sir Ed Davey had a childhood marked by adversity. His mother died when he was a teenager and his father died when he was just four.As an adult, Davey now cares for his son, who is disabled with a neurological condition.So what do we know about the man who leads the third party in British politics?His early lifeEd Davey was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on Christmas Day in 1965. He was the youngest of three boys, but lost his father at just four years old and then his mother when he was in his mid-teens. She had spent three years battling cancer, during which time he nursed his mother together with his grandmother and brother Henry.Once a keen Scout and Air Scout, he later remembers feeling “isolated” at school because of his caring responsibilities, which meant he couldn’t take part in after-school activities or sports. “The last 18 months she was bedridden and in a lot of pain. I’d spend hours on the bed, talking to her,” he said. Davey was with his mother when she died at Nottingham General Hospital, after being placed on an unsuited dementia ward.After both his parents had died, Davey was brought up by his maternal grandparents in the village of Eakring, though his grandfather died soon after. He spent much of his childhood and young adulthood close to his grandmother. “First of all, she was looking after me. Then we were looking after each other,” he said.His familyDavey married Emily Gasson, a former Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate who unsuccessfully stood in four elections and is now a councillor, in 2005 and the pair have two children, a son and daughter.Their son, John, born in 2007 and now a teenager, is disabled with a neurological condition. He has attended special schools but is now educated at home with a tutor – a change that Davey said led to him becoming verbal for the first time. He has spoken about his anxiety about who will care for his son when he and his wife are no longer around. “It’s the thing that worries me more than anything else in my life,” Davey said.Gasson was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in 2012. She was well for many years following her diagnosis, but declined during lockdown and is working on recovering her physical strength.His parentsEd Davey, pictured with his family. (Liberal Democrats)His father, John, was a solicitor and his mother, Nina, a teacher. Davey has described how he was inspired to study by his mother, who always wanted him to try hard academically and who he wanted to impress.His educationDavey attended the private Nottingham High School, the alma mater of former chancellor Kenneth Clarke. He became head boy, with Labour MP Ed Balls – who was studying in the year below – watching on.After school, he achieved a first class degree in philosophy, politics and economics at Jesus College, Oxford where he was junior common room president. After becoming an economics researcher for the Liberal Democrats he returned to study, reading for a master’s degree in economics at Birkbeck College, London.Ed Davey as Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change alongside the then leader of the Lib Dems, Nick Clegg, and Jo Swinson, pictured during the coalition government in 2015. (Getty)Why is he a Sir?For three years, the Lib Dem leader was a member of the cabinet in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition government, holding the post of secretary of state for energy and climate change from 2012 to 2015. He was knighted in the 2016 New Year’s Honours for “political and public services”."
Yahoo News UK,"Will Nigel Farage's Reform UK 'beat' the Tories in the election?With some polling figures putting the Tories and Reform UK nearly neck and neck, could Farage's party really end up with nearly as many MPs as Sunak's?","['What do the latest polls say?', 'Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?', 'Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?', 'What is proportional representation?']",James Cheng-Morris and  Ellen Manning,Updated 14 June 2024 at 4:33 am·7-min read,14,June,2024,04:33:00,7,"Leading pollster John Curtice has poured cold water on suggestions that Reform UK is now beating the Conservative Party in the general election polls.As representatives from seven parties took prepared to take part in a TV debate on Thursday, a YouGov survey for The Times newspaper said Reform’s support had increased by two points to 19%, putting them ahead of the Tories for the first time.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage took the the opportunity to hail the poll results in the debate, declaring: “We are now the opposition to Labour.”But Curtice urged caution, insisting that single polls should not be relied on. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""This is one poll - we’ve actually, I think, had four other polls published in the last 24 hours - none of which have had Reform ahead, not even all of which have had Reform gaining ground, but quite a couple of them certainly suggesting it’s also got very close.""He said it may not be the case that Reform are ahead - and could be on average four or five points behind. But he said: ""This is still bad news for the Conservatives. The only way Rishi Sunak can hope to get even to base camp in narrowing the lead that Labour have started off with this campaign was to squeeze the Reform vote.""He added: ""Rather than making progress, things are actually going backwards, not least of course because of Nigel Farage’s decision to fight this campaign.""With many speculating that Reform UK with Farage at the helm could ""beat"" the Tories, Yahoo News UK takes a look.What do the latest polls say?YouGov’s voting intention tracker, updated on Tuesday, suggests the Tories and Reform UK are neck and neck.With Labour well ahead on 38%, the Tories are trailing on 18% – compared to a high of 53% under Boris Johnson in 2020 – with Reform UK just behind on 17% and the Liberal Democrats on 15%.However, there are multiple polls taking place at any one time by a number of different companies.According to the PA news agency, an average of all polls that were carried out wholly or partly during the seven days to June 13 puts Labour on 43%, 21 points ahead of the Conservatives on 22%, followed by Reform on 14%, the Lib Dems on 10% and the Greens on 6%.And while Reform’s average is up one percentage point on the figure for the previous week and the Tories are down one point, there is still an eight-point gap, on average, between the two.Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?Unless something remarkable happens, in short: 'No' - and that's because of the first past the post (FPTP) voting system in which the candidate with the largest number of votes in their constituency is elected.According to the Electoral Reform Society, which is against FPTP, this system leads to a situation where “even if millions of voters support the same party, if they are thinly spread out across the UK they may only get the largest number of votes in a couple of these contests – so only win a few MPs"".“Tens of thousands of voters supporting a different party, but who live near each other, could end up with more MPs. This means the number of MPs a party has in parliament rarely matches their popularity with the public.”Rishi Sunak on the campaign trail on Wednesday. (AFP via Getty Images)Farage knows this well. As the leader of UKIP in the 2015 election, he saw his party win 12.6% of the nationwide vote and one seat. The Liberal Democrats won 7.9% of the vote... and eight seats.Indeed, YouGov last week released a poll – put together using the multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) surveying technique, from a sample size of nearly 60,000 respondents – which suggested the Tories would win just 140 seats, having won 365 in 2019. But this is still 140 more than the zero it projected Reform UK to win, in spite of its strong polling figures.The model had Reform UK ""performing strongly in a number of seats but still a long way off winning in any"", with projected second-placed finishes in 27 constituencies.YouGov's MRP projection. (YouGov)Granted, this model was formed between 24 May and 1 June, before Farage's headline-grabbing intervention on Monday last week in which he announced he would be standing as an MP.But, even as Reform UK polls closer than ever to the Tories, it's difficult to imagine the party winning more than a handful of seats.Chris Hopkins, director at polling firm Savanta, told Yahoo News UK that in one respect, Reform UK is at an advantage compared to Ukip in 2015 because ""Ukip took votes from both Labour and the Conservatives, and we are not seeing that with Reform UK – they are all coming from the Conservatives.""That is the consequence of Rishi Sunak making immigration a centrepiece of the campaign and failing to deliver on it. Even if you have voters that are neutral on immigration, they would say the small boats policy has been a disaster.""But even so, Hopkins said, Reform UK is still ""at a huge electoral disadvantage"" in that its votes are not very concentrated, they are very evenly spread.""There are going to be some races where Reform UK is strong - the Nigel Farage factor in Clacton is really interesting - but realistically its ceiling is five seats: and that’s a high ceiling.""Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey on a campaign visit in Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire, on Wednesday. (PA)Like Reform UK, Sir Ed Davey’s Liberal Democrats are performing well in the polls.In a sign of how defensive the Tory campaign is becoming, one online party advert claims voting for Reform UK or the Lib Dems could give Labour 100 extra seats, resulting in the biggest majority in its history.It depicts a scenario where the Conservatives are beaten into third place behind the Lib Dems, with just 57 seats, despite getting 19% of the vote and without Reform winning a single seat.Read more: Pollsters got it wrong in 2015, so could Labour’s lead be overestimated? (The Guardian)However, it remains unlikely the Lib Dems will finish second. YouGov’s MRP poll projected the party performing strongly, winning 48 seats. This would be up 37 from 2019, but still nowhere near the Tories’ projected 140.However, amid all this talk about projections, it’s worth remembering they are still only polls and not a definite indicator of how people will vote on 4 July. The 1992 and 2015 elections are notable examples of how polling didn’t match the end results of Tory wins.What is proportional representation?Proportional representation, as defined by the UK parliament, is an electoral system ""in which the distribution of seats corresponds closely with the proportion of the total votes cast for each party. For example, if a party gained 40% of the total votes, a perfectly proportional system would allow them to gain 40% of the seats.""This differs from the first past the post system, as set out above, in that a relatively high vote share rarely corresponds with increased seats for the smaller parties. In 2019, for example, the Lib Dems won 11.5% of the vote but only 1.7% – 11 – of the 650 seats.Unsurprisingly, both Reform UK and the Lib Dems support proportional representation.The Lib Dems this week made it part of their manifesto, with the party saying it would introduce the single transferrable vote method, a form of proportional representation which allows electors to rank their preference of candidates on the ballot.The party previously sought to change the UK’s voting system while in the coalition government under then-leader Nick Clegg, but voters rejected the plan in a 2011 referendum.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

The Telegraph,Marine Le Pen: How the National Rally leader redefined the party ahead of the French election,"['‘Unabashed racist’', 'De-demonising the party', 'Supporters upbeat']",Henry Samuel,1 July 2024 at 1:09 pm·11-min read,1,July,2024,01:09:00,11,"It was a defining moment in Marine Le Pen’s painstaking bid to “de-demonise” her party.As the National Rally leader was about to deliver a speech at her party’s traditional May 1 march in 2015, her estranged father took to the stage.She had already banned Jean-Marie Le Pen, the ageing Holocaust denier, from speaking after a fresh salvo of anti-Semitic comments, including that he had never considered France’s wartime collaborationist leader Philippe Petain a traitor and labelling then prime minister Manuel Valls an immigrant due to his Spanish roots.But he defied her and, dressed in red in defiance, stood before the crowd, waving his fists in the air and exclaiming: “I’ve been disowned.”Enough was enough, and he was subsequently booted out of the party altogether.Marine’s cut-throat family purge appears to have spectacularly paid off as her party has reached “the gates of power” after clinching a historic score in Sunday’s first round of snap parliamentary elections.While the RN may yet fall short of an absolute majority in next Sunday’s run-off, the fact that 10.6 million French, or 33 per cent of voters, cast a ballot in her favour is a massive vindication of Ms Le Pen’s attempts to erase its pariah status.“In the space of a few years we’ve gone from being the most hated party in France to the most loved party,” she recently told the Telegraph.The RN won 31 per cent of the vote in the June 9 European elections, far ahead of Emmanuel Macron’s camp on 14.6 per cent, with several polls suggesting her bid to prove she had broken with her party’s xenophobic, anti-Semitic past was gradually bearing fruit.Last year, for the first time since 1984, more French people (45 per cent) than the reverse (41 per cent) said they no longer viewed the RN as a “threat to democracy”, according to a Verian-Epoka survey.“Now, that’s not something you can do by snapping your fingers. I’m not the only one responsible, but come on, maybe I’ll give myself a little credit for this development”, said Ms Le Pen, who has an eye on the presidency in 2027.“I think we’ve done our homework. Does that mean that the political and media system is not yet reticent? Of course it is, but it’s been humming along for 30 years and someone coming along and changing things creates resistance. That’s not a problem, we’re used to it.”During the campaign, political rivals seized on the party’s toxic history to try to mobilise voters against it in the run-up to France’s snap election.Left-wing and centrist politicians reminded voters that when Ms Le Pen’s father co-founded the party – originally named Front National – in 1972, its ranks included former members of a Waffen SS military unit under Nazi command during the Second World War.However, president Macron has previously cautioned against this approach.When Élisabeth Borne, his former prime minister and the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, told a radio station in 2023 that Ms Le Pen’s party were heirs of Pétain, he warned that “history and morality” were no longer effective in countering its apparently inexorable rise.“You will never make millions of people who have voted for the ‘far-Right’ believe they are fascists,” Mr Macron reportedly told ministers, suggesting that gunning for its policies, not its past was the best way to bring it down.That past is undoubtedly racist and anti-Semitic. Mr Le Pen, a former paratrooper who had served in Algeria, once founded a company that sold recordings of Nazi speeches and German military songs.In 1987, he famously dubbed the Holocaust a “mere detail” of the Second World War and was subsequently convicted of hate speech and contesting crimes against humanity.‘Unabashed racist’An unabashed racist, in 1996, he said he believed in the “inequality of the races” and that ebola was a blessing for Africa as it would result in fewer migrants coming to Europe.When, in 2002, he shocked France by making the second round of the presidential election, it sparked mass street demonstrations. His rival, Jacques Chirac, won with more than 82 per cent of the vote.When Ms Le Pen, Jean-Marie Le Pen’s youngest daughter, took over the anti-immigration party in 2011, she ousted many of its most extreme elements and toned down its language, framing it as a governing rather than protest party.She then ousted her father from the party, saying his outbursts were “political suicide”.In 2018, she changed the party’s name to National Rally and took a case to France’s highest administrative court, the Council of State, arguing that it should no longer be labelled “far-Right” by the interior ministry. The case was dismissed and France officially classifies the party as far-Right.However, heated debate erupted during this campaign over whether the term was still appropriate.David Pujadas, a well-known anchorman on rolling news channel LCI, said he thought it wasn’t.“Studying the far Right in Europe, I saw what Geert Wilders was proposing in the Netherlands, what the AfD was proposing in Germany... And I saw the gulf that separated these parties from the RN,” he told Le Quotidien. “So here, it’s the far Right and elsewhere it’s the far far Right? That’s why I changed.”In that case, ex-Trotskyist Jean-Luc Mélenchon and his France Unbowed party should be dubbed “far Left”, said RMC colleague Apolline de Malherbe, even if the Council of State does not use that term for that party.Perhaps Ms Le Pen’s main weapon in her detoxification drive is Jordan Bardella, the 28-year-old party leader who hopes to become France’s next prime minister after the run-off on Sunday.With his Colgate smile, ideal son-in-law good looks and taste for TikTok and selfies, Mr Bardella has brought in a new generation of supporters with a consensual image.However, both he and Ms Le Pen have kept the party’s essential doctrine, namely “national preference”, and which she has rechristened “national priority”. In other words, French citizens should be given priority over non-nationals for jobs, social welfare assistance and housing.Rights groups and constitutionalists say the doctrine is discriminatory and anti-constitutional.A key plank of its manifesto is to end birthright citizenship, namely the right for children born to foreign parents on French soil, who are raised and schooled in France, to later claim French nationality.But experts point out that eliminating birthright citizenship could encounter constitutional hurdles.His party also shocked many during the campaign by expressing its intention to ban dual nationals from taking up sensitive posts, which would have barred a former education minister and various diplomats from keeping their jobs. France has three million dual nationals and the mooted measure caused uproar.The party has also kept its long-running hard line on law and order, arguing that crime is linked to immigration. Ms Le Pen wants to introduce a presumption of “legitimate defence” for police officers firing weapons.De-demonising the partyMr Bardella has pledged to fight a “cultural battle” against Islamism, to demand a €2 billion (£1.7 billion) rebate from the European Union, drastically reduce legal and illegal immigration and deport foreign criminals if he leads the government.Speaking to the Telegraph recently, he said: “We’ve been de-demonising the party for 10 years. Now I want to institutionalise it.”That he said had been done by the 88 MPs from his party forming the largest single-party opposition force in the previous parliament. In what has been dubbed “the tie strategy”, they were ordered to look the part and avoid any controversial rhetoric to show they were ready to take the levers of power.“We’ve changed dimension. We are the most serious group in the National Assembly,” he claimed. Meanwhile, the national cursor had moved to the Right on most of the issues it had been defending for years.By contrast with the RN, the Left has wreaked chaos in parliament, flouting basic rules by, for example, brandishing Palestinian flags in the National Assembly and blocking debates.But economically, the RN is, if anything, far-Left, proposing to cut the retirement age to 60 for some, slash VAT on energy prices and block the price of essential goods, even if it toned down some of these during the campaign to avoid scaring the markets.National Rally expert Jean-Yves Camus said that it resembled other European “illiberal” parties found in Hungary with Victor Orban or in Poland’s Law and Justice party that “undermine the system of checks and balances that is characteristic of democracy”. It is also historically pro-Putin, seen as a strong hand who defends traditional values and Christian roots, but has rowed back since the Ukraine war.He said perhaps the main reasons the RN had become more palatable was the state of the other parties, which were either in ruins or had radicalised, making the Le Pen camp appear more mainstream.“First, we have a president who wanted to play poker and lost, never had a real political party to act as a conveyor belt for his ideas and is now paying for the fact that he wanted to establish a quasi-vertical link with the French people and failed,” he told the Telegraph.“Second, France is probably the only major country in Europe without a conservative Right.”The once-mighty Gaullist Republicans, which won 10 per cent of the vote, are deeply divided after a spectacular split over whether ot not to back Ms Le Pen.Ms Le Pen has benefited from the xenophobic, anti-Islamic outbursts of Eric Zemmour, a polemist whose rhetoric makes her look like a shrinking violet, and has distanced herself from Germany’s far-Right AfD.Last month, she said her party would no longer sit in the EU parliament with the AfD after the head of its European election list said that someone who had been a member of the SS was “not automatically a criminal”.By contrast, she has sought to build bridges with Giorgia Melona, the Italian prime minister, who on Monday said that attempts to “demonise” far-Right voters were losing impact.“I notice something that in different forms is also happening in Italy: the constant attempt to demonise and corner the people who don’t vote for the Left,” said the most Right-wing Italian leader since the Second World War.“It’s a trick that serves to escape debating on the merits of different political proposals. But it’s a trick that fewer and fewer people fall for. We’ve seen it in Italy, and we’re seeing it more and more in Europe and throughout the West”.But above all, said Mr Camus, Ms Le Pen’s ranks had swollen due to the mass rejection of the fiery Jean-Luc Mélenchon, an admirer of Hugo Chavez and Mao Zedong, whose Unbowed France, LFI, is part of the New Popular Front, which came second on Sunday.“No doubt on Sunday, moderate voters, even social democrat voters, will find it very difficult to put a Popular Front ballot paper in the box due to his outbursts.”This explains why Mr Bardella is so keen to debate with Mr Mélenchon rather than a more moderate member of the Left-wing alliance.Beyond his tepid support for Ukraine and refusal to call Hamas a terrorist organisation after the Oct 7 attack on Israel, Mr Mélenchon has been accused of downplaying anti-Semitic incidents and pandering to the radical Muslim vote.“It reminds me a lot of George Galloway in the UK whose Respect Party tried to bring about this sort of fusion between political Islam and the far Left. It worked quite well but is a turn-off for most,” he said.As parties jockey to forge alliances and strategies to keep the RN out, Sunday will be the ultimate crash test of whether the de-demonisation drive is complete.Supporters upbeatMeanwhile, its supporters have the wind in their sails and are prepared to forget Mr Bardella’s decision to dilute some of his policies.Shortly after the results were announced at Ms Le Pen’s northern fiefdom of Hénin-Beaumont, one said: “He’s reasonable, in fact he does what other parties fail to do, which is not to offer promises he cannot keep. We won’t be able to do everything straight away.”Then the subject moved onto immigration and the tone became more radical.One supporter called Vanessa said: “We need to bin immigration. We don’t have the same culture, we don’t have the same values. They want to try and change us. Never. I’d rather die. With the Popular Front, we’ll end up under under Sharia law. No way.”Edouard was even more direct. “I’ve had enough of the Left that doles out lessons to everyone. If they love migrants that much, they can have them in their block of flats. They have houses, a job and cars. Why are they in my social housing and whites sleep on the sidewalk?”Minutes earlier, Ms Le Pen had taken to the stage to call on the French to vote National Rally to “finally get back unity and fraternity”."

The polls have consistently painted a very bleak picture for the prime minister, with Labour holding on to a double-digit poll lead over his Conservatives.Recent by-election results suggest that Labour is likely to win a landslide victory – but there’s still time for the PM to turn it around.Here’s everything you need to know about Sunak and what’s he’s saying about the biggest issues in British politics right now.Early lifeSunak was born in Southampton in 1980, the eldest of three children. His Indian parents both arrived from East Africa in the 1960s. A football-mad boy whose childhood idol was Matt Le Tissier, Sunak was described by the family’s neighbours as a child with “lovely manners”.In his youngest years, the PM attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. According to a recent biography, fellow pupil Ollie Case said: “He was someone that was talked about. The teachers would say: ‘He’s going to be prime minister'.""But, growing up in the 1980s and 90s, he also remembers experiencing racism. “My mother was obsessed with us not having accents,” Sunak has said.Rishi Sunak was football-mad as a boy growing up in Southampton. (ITV)Sunak's familySunak is married to Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian entrepreneur and multi-billionaire. The pair first met in 2004 at Stanford University, his future wife apparently attracted to his “honesty and integrity”.Five years later they married in a two-day Indian wedding held in Bangalore. The couple have two daughters, Krishna and Anoushka, who will turn 13 and 11 this year, both of whom are largely kept out of the public eye.Sunak attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. (Rishi Sunak, Instagram)His parentsYashvir Sunak, Rishi’s father, was born in Kenya. He arrived in the UK to study medicine and then stayed, becoming an NHS GP. His mother, Usha, was born in Tanzania and is a pharmacist.The couple met in Britain and settled in Southampton in the 1970s. Usha is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.His educationAs a teenager Sunak studied at Winchester College where he was, he says, a self-confessed “geek”. According to a recent biography, the “naughtiest” thing the prime minister did during his school days “was to smuggle a hand-held television into the school so that he did not miss any key games of Euro 96”.The childhood home of Rishi Sunak in Southampton. (Getty Images, photo taken in 2022)Perhaps unsurprisingly for someone with such an unblemished record, he went on to become the school’s head boy. Sunak worked while studying, delivering medicines for his mother’s pharmacy and as a waiter at a local Indian restaurant.After school, Sunk read philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, graduating in 2001 with a first class degree. While still at university he held an internship at the Conservative Party campaign headquarters and joined the party, but went on studying before entering politics.He earned his MBA from Stanford in 2006 as a Fulbright Scholar, meaning he was selected among the most promising candidates from the UK.How much is he worth?As prime minister, Rishi Sunak earns £80,807 on top of a salary of £84,144 for being an MP. But his current income from Westminster pales in comparison to his family’s vast wealth through marriage.The Sunday Times valued the couple’s joint fortune at £730m. Murty's father is the co-founder of Infosys, an Indian tech conglomerate, in which she holds shares estimated at around £430m. Her family is also involved in a £900m business arrangement with Amazon in India, and she is a shareholder of multiple other companies.Rishi Sunak's mother is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.Before entering politics Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and a series of hedge funds. He is also known to have invested in blind trusts, in which investments are made without holders knowing where the funds are located. These arrangements reportedly hold Sunak’s own multi-million-pound fortune.His religionSunak is not only the first prime minister of colour and of Indian heritage but he is also the first practising Hindu to hold the biggest job in UK politics.He has spoken of his pride in his Hindu faith, saying, “that’s how I was raised, and that’s how I am”. He said: “Having faith gives you resilience, gives you strength that is important and it provides an outlook on life which I find particularly valuable.”Sunak on... the NHSThe prime minister’s biggest challenge in office has been the crisis in the NHS - and to many people in the sector his government has been found wanting. “We have not made enough progress,” Sunak said when asked about his commitment to cut NHS waiting lists during an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV. Asked if that meant he had failed, the prime minister replied: “Yes, we have.""Sunak expects to see waiting lists start to reduce this spring, and blames the delays on “industrial action”, as disputes with junior doctors and consultants over pay and conditions continue. Yet Sunak himself has been blamed for holding up a deal that would prevent more walkouts.Sunak, his wife Akshata and daughters Anoushka and Krishna (second left) at Santa Monica Pier, California, on their summer holiday in 2023. (AP)Sunak on… immigrationAccording to the prime minister, illegal migration threatens to “overwhelm” Europe. In June 2023 he claimed his plan to “stop the boats” and tackle illegal immigration was working, but by August 2023 he had changed his mind: “It’s not an easy problem to fix,” he told broadcasters. “I never said we would be able to solve it overnight.”He has staked much of his reputation on the government's Rwanda Bill - his plan to deport asylum seekers to the east African country that finally became law last month, after months of legal and procedural challenges. It has paved the way for deportation flights to get off the ground within weeks.He described his policy, which he says will act as a deterrent to people traffickers, as being “the will of the people” – yet polling suggests low support for such a punitive approach.The policy, coupled with Conservative talk of limits on legal migration, shows that the government is committed to taking a hard line on the issue, despite the risk of alienating more moderate voters.The Rwanda policy is not universally popular. (YouGov)Sunak on... the cost of living crisisThe prime minister has told hard-pressed working families that they will feel some relief from the cost of living crisis as inflation continues to drop following its highs of October 2022. He described the government’s tax cuts as “meaningful” and has welcomed the dip in mortgage rates at the turn of the year.Sunak says falling inflation will have the biggest impact on family budgets “and will start to ease some of those pressures” and that he was right to focus on that figure. However, the global drop in energy prices is probably the biggest factor in easing the hit on wallets - something that the prime minister has no control over.However, the fall in inflation to 2.3% on 22 May this year – the lowest it has been in nearly three years – was likely one of the key factors in persuading Sunak to call a snap election many weeks earlier than experts had predicted.Can we expect more handouts or tax breaks to help balance family budgets? Not according to Sunak, who has warned voters that it’s time to “move on” from government support.Sunak on... pensionsThe triple-lock pensions policy is a tricky one for Sunak – especially since Labour has committed to retaining the policy. Any change to a policy that has become a hallmark of recent Conservative governments would not go down well with the 12 million pensioners it would likely impact – many of whom are lifelong Tory voters.Last November, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said pensions should start being pegged to an average of inflation and wage growth, which would help reduce state spending over time.Sunak’s response to that was ambiguous to say the least: “We are the government that has … delivered the triple lock and it is why, right now, pensions are, depending on how you look at it, £800 or £900 bigger than they otherwise would have been.” He is yet to confirm whether it will appear in the manifesto."

Explaining why this is such a big deal in the world of political modelling, JLP says: ""The main advantage of this kind of stacking is that we can use different models to probe different parts of the data giving a more holistic set of predictions that consider many different facets of the data.""This includes models that are superior at unpicking the constituency level predictors whilst other models can investigate the individual level effects in much more detail.""Some models, like multilevel regression, can analyse both the individual level and constituency level data simultaneously. The combination of these models then produces estimates that more accurately represent the nuances in the underlying data.""Other noteworthy prediction in JLP's model, described as a ""super poll"" by the Times' chief political commentator Tim Shipman, is Reform UK winning two seats, with Nigel Farage predicted to win Clacton and Lee Anderson, who defected from the Tories in March, keeping hold of Ashfield.The Liberal Democrats are also tracked to regain their place as the third party of British politics, going from just 11 seats in the Commons to 55, while the Scottish National Party (SNP) are set to lose 33 seats, leaving only 15.The level of detail in JLP's model means the company has been able to put together a list of major Conservative MPs expected to lose their seats, including Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Grant Shapps, Mel Stride and Esther McVey.You can search for your constituency to find the projected winner and their margin of victory here. Reform UK snapping at Tories' heels as Labour takes dipYouGov's voting intention tracker currently predicts Labour to win 37% of the vote.Although it is still by far the highest scoring political party, it is a significant drop from the 47% recorded on 28 May – six days after Sunak called a surprise snap general election.There is only a 2% margin between Reform UK and the Tories, according to YouGov, with the Conservative's projected to win 20% of the vote, compared to 18% for Nigel Farage's party.Labour vote share drops to 'lowest in over two years'In another sign that Labour's success has plateaued, a recent poll for the Telegraph suggests there is only a 17% gap between the Tories and Starmer's party.This would leave Labour with its lowest predicted vote share since January 2022, when Boris Johnson was still prime minister, according to pollsters Savanta.However, this is unlikely to worry Starmer, as the poll still puts Labour on track to win 38% of the vote and a majority of more than 260 seats.🚨NEW Westminster Voting Intention for Sunday @Telegraph📈Lowest Labour vote share since January 2022🌹Lab 38 (-4)🌳Con 21 (=)➡️Reform 14 (=)🔶LD 11 (+1)🌍Green 6 (+1)🎗️SNP 2 (-1)⬜️Other 7 (+1)2,092 UK adults26-28 June (chg from 21-24 June) pic.twitter.com/cdyp3lJygQ— Savanta UK (@Savanta_UK) June 29, 2024Chris Hopkins, the director of political research at Savanta, told the Telegraph: “This is our lowest Labour vote share since Rishi Sunak became prime minister, and the Conservatives for their part do appear to have slowed or stopped their downward spiral.""He added that a rise in vote share for the Green Party and independent candidates will not have a significant impact on election day but could ""point towards trouble for the Labour Party in government and over the coming years"".What are the latest odds?As of 1 July, Oddschecker – a website which compares odds across different bookmakers – had Labour at 1/41 to win the most seats. To put that in context, this is seen as so likely that a £10 bet would return just £10.24.Bookies are putting the Conservatives at 125/1 to win the most seats, or to win a majority, with both scenarios so unlikely that a £10 punt would return £1,260.Reform UK has better chances, according to Oddschecker, with 80/1 odds of winning the most seats in the general election and 100/1 odds of having an overall majority.What went wrong for the Tories?So, why have the polls changed so dramatically? It's worth looking back on an extremely eventful four-and-a-half years in UK politics.According to YouGov's voting intention tracker (see chart above), Tory support peaked at 53%, with Labour on 32%, in April 2020, months after the party's stunning success in the 2019 general election and Boris Johnson's pledge to “get Brexit done”. That month also saw Starmer take over as Labour leader from Jeremy Corbyn.This was also amid a spirit of national unity following the onset of the COVID pandemic which nearly killed Johnson himself. The then-PM had been released from hospital five days before this particular survey was taken.Boris Johnson delivers his final speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street in September 2022. (AFP via Getty Images)Over the rest of the year, there was a downturn in support amid chaos over COVID rules, with the Tories falling as low as 35% in November 2020, compared to Labour on 40%.However, the UK’s successful COVID vaccination programme provided a pathway out of lockdown and with it, improved poll ratings. Tory support peaked at 41% in June 2021, with Labour at 30%.In October that year, there was a sense Johnson was untouchable. At the Tory party conference, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg remarked how the PM was ""in total command of his party, and politically dominant in the country"".But this fell apart quickly with the Partygate scandal, which emerged in November that year. Time and again, reports emerged of government and Tory staff – including Johnson – having taken part in lockdown-era social gatherings when their own COVID rules had prohibited them.By January 2022, Tory support had plummeted to 28%, with Labour on 38%. Johnson struggled on, but never recovered and a wave of ministerial resignations forced him to resign in July that year.The UK had three separate prime ministers – Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak – between 6 September and 24 October, 2022. (Getty Images)His successor, Liz Truss, then embarked on arguably the most disastrous prime ministerial reign in history, characterised by the catastrophic ""mini-budget"", containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, which prompted an economic crisis. Like Johnson, she lost the confidence of Tory MPs – and voters – and had to resign.Her 49-day spell as PM was the shortest in history, with Tory support plummeting to 19% (with Labour on 56%) the day after she announced her resignation in October 2022.Rishi Sunak, who had lost to Truss in the previous month's Tory leadership election, took over. However, as the above YouGov chart indicates, he has failed to cut through with voters. Tory support was at 23% two days after he assumed office, with the most recent survey, carried out on Thursday, showing support is now lower than under Truss at 18%.In short, the polls and odds, not to mention other factors such as notable by-election victories for Starmer's Labour, are pointing to a Labour government next week.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

The Independent,Election watchdog needs tough new powers to tackle alleged racism after Reform ‘p***’ row,[],Nadine White,1 July 2024 at 11:00 am·5-min read,1,July,2024,11:00:00,5,"Campaigners have called for the Electoral Commission to be given powers to investigate discriminatory language used in campaigns after multiple Reform UK candidates were engulfed in racism rows.During the six week campaign Reform has been forced to ditch at least 11 parliamentary candidates over accusations they made racist comments on social media, including one prospective MP who said African people had among the “lowest IQs in the world.Last week canvasser Andrew Parker, referred to prime minister Rishi Sunak as a “f***ing p***” in undercover footage from a Channel 4 investigation. Essex Police said it is “urgently assessing” Mr Parker’s remarks to establish if there are any criminal offences. And Reform UK candidates were found to be members of a public Facebook group that regularly posts racist messages such as a post stating there should be “no race mixing” and that “the only thing black a white woman should have is black leather”.Andrew Parker was recorded using offensive slur against the prime minister (Channel 4)But despite widespread outrage, the commission says it can only investigate and sanction parties for breaches of the political finance and imprint laws.Labour’s Bell Ribeiro-Addy, former MP for Streatham and who is running for Clapham and Brixton Hill, is among those calling for the watchdog’s remit to be broadened.“Overseeing our democratic functions should include a responsibility to protect all citizens from racism and bigotry,” she told The Independent. “Discrimination is against our laws and any political party using racist, homophobic, disabilist or misogynist language should face consequences. During an election the most obvious body to police the type of hateful language we have seen used by the Reform UK campaign is the electoral commission.”The calls come as Europe experiences a surge in far right parties, including Marine Le Pen’s National Rally which is leading in the first round of a snap election called by Emmanuel Macron.Femi Oluwole was removed from Reform UK’s rally in Birmingham on Sunday (Femi Oluwole)Campaign group Grassroots Black Left said it is seeing: “an alarming current surge in support for the nationalist far right in Europe, including France, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy. All of them have achieved success by disguising their previously overt racism, Islamophobia, antisemitism, xenophobia and other forms of disgusting bigotry to fool voters. The Electoral Commission needs to have the powers to intervene as a supposed regulator.”Black columnist Femi Oluwole was removed from a Reform rally by security guards over the weekend. He told The Independent that the last few years have revealed the UK’s political system “doesn’t have anything close to the safeguards it needs”.“Blatant hate speech and death threats have been used by senior politicians without lasting consequence,” he said. “All of this must change. The electoral commission should ban anyone who is found to have acted unlawfully in office from standing again - and we need stricter laws on hate speech from politicians.“I don’t believe in arresting every citizen who says something racist. But if a politician goes on national TV and dishonesty brands almost half of British Muslims as terrorist supporters, that is implied incitement.”Mr Oluwole cited a Sky News interview last month, where Mr Farage, the former Ukip leader said: “We have a growing number of young people in this country who do not subscribe to British values, (who) in fact loathe much of what we stand for.”When asked if he was talking about Muslims, Farage replied: “We are. … And I’m afraid I found some of the recent surveys saying that 46 per cent of British Muslims support Hamas – support a terrorist organisation that is proscribed in this country.”The survey asked British Muslims who they have more empathy for out of Hamas and Israel.Labour’s Bell Ribeiro-Addy says the Electoral Commission needs to police offensive campaigning (PA)During a TV interview in 2017, Mr Farage said “frankly, if you open your door to uncontrolled immigration from Middle Eastern countries, you are inviting in terrorism.”Concerns have been raised that such divisive rhetoric is being normalised. From Enoch Powell’s racist ‘Rivers of Blood’ speech in 1968 to former prime minister Boris Johnson, who called burka-wearing Muslim women “letterboxes”, Black Lives Matter UK pointed to a history of political figures “leveraging racism for their gain”.“The rise of Reform UK has been deeply troubling, and it is not surprising that members of Reform UK have been caught making racist remarks while campaigning,” a BLM UK spokesperson told The Independent. While pointing out that addressing racist campaigning was not within its remit, the Electoral Commission urged those involved in political campaigns to be “respectful”.Enoch Powell is notorious for his hateful ""Rivers of Blood"" speech“Campaigning is a vital part of our democratic process and usually carried out respectfully. However, our research has shown that harassment and abuse of candidates has become too common,” a spokesperson said. “Campaigning can and should take place without the use of inflammatory language or anyone experiencing abuse.“We urge campaigners to talk to their staff and volunteers about the importance of safe and respectful campaigning.”Reform UK was approached for comment.Nigel Farage claimed Reform’s ‘bad apples’ have been rooted out (Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved)Addressing a rally in Birmingham on Sunday, party leader Nigel Farage insisted that “the bad apples are gone” after withdrawing support for three candidates.“Look, Reform is a new organisation,” he told the audience. “It’s a start-up and there were requests put out for candidates to stand.“Have we had a few bad apples? We have, although to my knowledge nobody involved in an organised betting ring is standing for us, which is something.”Mr Farage has suggested that Mr Parker, who is an actor, was used as a “plant” by Channel 4 in their undercover investigation into his campaign – a claim the broadcaster strenuously denies."
The Guardian,Starmer says far-right win in France would not stop Labour trying to forge better EU deal,[],Aletha Adu Political correspondent,1 July 2024 at 0:47 pm·3-min read,1,July,2024,00:47:00,3,"Keir Starmer has said that a government in France led by Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) party would not hamper a Labour government’s intention to negotiate a better EU deal.The RN made historic gains in the first round of France’s snap elections on Sunday with 33% of the vote, bringing the possibility the party could emerge as the largest in the final round of voting next Sunday.The Labour leader was asked if he was concerned that a victory for Le Pen would hamper his ability to gain closer economic ties with the EU if he becomes prime minister.“I genuinely don’t want to get ahead of myself. Firstly, we haven’t seen the final outcome in France, we’ve also got a big outcome of our own on Thursday, so we need those two pieces to fall into place and to be clear, I don’t think it affects the overall intention that we have, which is to negotiate a better deal with the EU,” he said.“I think the deal we’ve got is botched, I think that anyone who does business with the EU feels that it’s botched and that we could do better than that, across not just trade but research and development, and also on the security front.”While Starmer has ruled out radically reforming Britain’s ties with the EU, he has said a Labour government would “reset” its relationship with the EU, with members of his top team including David Lammy, Jonathan Reynolds and the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, saying it would be in the country’s “national interest”.He stressed he was willing to “work with any government in Europe and across the world”.He added: “For me, that’s what serious government is about. So yes, we will work with whoever.“I do think it is important that we make the progressive case to meet the challenges that we face across Europe and across the world. And that’s why Thursday and the general election here is so important, because I think that only progressive answers will actually make a material difference to the challenges that we’re facing.”Le Pen has a preference for bilateral deals over EU-wide ones. Starmer said: “I’ve always supported bilaterals as well as EU-wide agreements. They’re not mutually exclusive.“And some of the agreements we’ve got with France are bilateral in any event. I think they need to be stronger and better and deeper, particularly in relation to smashing the gangs that are running the vile trade of putting people into boats.”Starmer was speaking to reporters in the constituency of Buckingham and Bletchley on the second stop of his tour through formerly safe rural Conservative heartlands, having first visited Hitchen before heading to Banbury in Oxfordshire where the Tory cabinet minister Victoria Prentis hopes to hold her seat.He said the rise of nationalism meant that Labour had to “address the everyday concerns of so many people in this country who feel disaffected by politics”.Starmer did dodge questions over whether he would meet the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, if he were to become prime minister, dismissing it as “simply not an issue” at the moment.Rishi Sunak criticised Starmer for failing to match the Conservative’s pledge to increase defence spending, a pledge made only after former ministers spoke out about the need for it.“It sends a bad signal to our adversaries, like Putin, that we’re not serious about investing in our security, that we don’t have the staying power to stand up to him,” Sunak told Times Radio.Reform UK announced a £1m advertising splurge in the final days of the campaign, claiming it had been “flooded” with £400,000 of donations in 24 hours, and that the party’s membership had doubled from 30,000 to 60,000 in the last month."

It could have been the moment to say ‘I love you and I respect you’.“I had a fight with myself about saying it, but I didn’t and I walked away.“It is the one thing I do regret.”"

Many also assume his title is hereditary.Here's what you need to know about the personal life of the man who wants to be the UK’s next prime minister.His early lifeStarmer was born in Southwark, south London, in 1962, as the second of four children. His parents were Labour Party members and named him after Keir Hardie, the party’s first leader in parliament.The family moved out of the capital and he grew up in Hurst Green, a village just outside the small Surrey town of Oxted. He was active in youth politics from his teenage years but was also a skilled musician, taking music lessons alongside Norman Cook, who later became better known as a member of The Housemartins and the DJ Fatboy Slim.Starmer played the flute, piano, violin and recorder and was a junior exhibitioner at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.His familyStarmer with his wife, Lady Victoria Starmer, at the Labour Party Conference in October 2023. (Alamy)Starmer is married to Victoria, a former solicitor who later retrained in occupational health and now works for the NHS. The pair met through their work in the law in the early 2000s and married in Essex in 2007.She was first seen accompanying her husband when the couple were filmed clapping for carers during the pandemic in 2020 outside their home in Camden. They have two children, a son and daughter, but both are kept out of the public eye.Victoria's father was Jewish and originally came from Poland, while her mother converted when they got married. Starmer has said in a previous interview that ""my wife in particular wants our children to know the faith of her family"" and that they ""observe some of the practices, for example Friday night prayers"".His parentsKeir Starmer with parents, Rodney and Josephine, at his graduation. (Twitter/Keir Starmer)The Labour leader's father, Rodney Starmer, worked as a toolmaker in a factory, and his mother Josephine Starmer (née Baker), was a nurse.His father worked long, 14-hour days but spent his time outside work caring for Josephine, who was diagnosed with the autoimmune condition Still’s disease. She required two hip and knee replacements twice in her lifetime and struggled with arthritic pain.As a young man Starmer also helped care for his mother, which he has said led to him being more emotionally reserved. His sister, Katy, recalled: “He’s had to be a grown-up all his life. I’ve always been quite open about my feelings – Keir is good at most things, but not that.” Josephine Starmer died in 2015, and his father three years later.His educationA photograph of a younger Starmer as shown on ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories in 2021. (ITV)Starmer passed the 11-plus examination, and attended Reigate Grammar School from age 11. While he was at the school it became an independent fee-paying institution, but as an existing student he was exempt from fees, and his tuition in the sixth form was covered by a bursary.After school he studied law at the University of Leeds, this first in his family to attend university, graduating with a first class degree in 1985. He undertook postgraduate law studied at the University of Oxford, where he served as editor of a radical magazine, Socialist Alternatives.Why is he a sir?Keir Starmer pictured in 2010, when he was director of public prosecutions, making a statement about MPs who face charges over their expenses claims.

In 2008 he was appointed head of the Crown Prosecution Service and DPP.During his tenure he chose to prosecute three Labour MPs and a Conservative in the wake of the parliamentary expenses scandal, and was responsible for prosecuting former MP Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce for perverting the course of justice after Pryce claimed responsibility for her former husband’s speeding offence."
Yahoo News UK,"Three important UK election issues, explainedRishi Sunak said his leadership is needed in 'uncertain' times. Keir Starmer said the country needs to be 'rebuilt'. So what issues do voters care about most?","['The economy', 'Health', 'Immigration and asylum']",James Cheng-Morris,Updated 28 May 2024 at 9:11 am·5-min read,28,May,2024,09:11:00,5,"After months of speculation, Rishi Sunak confirmed the general election will be held on 4 July.The prime minister said Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer could not be trusted to lead the country through “uncertain” times. He made the economy and combating global security the key elements of his pitch to the nation as he announced the election date.In response, Starmer told voters: “Together we can stop the chaos, we can turn the page, we can start to rebuild Britain.”But amid this “uncertainty” and need to “rebuild”, what do the voters consider the key issues?This chart, produced using YouGov polling over the course of this parliament, offers an insight in the issues voters care most about and how that has ebbed and flowed over time.Compared to when Boris Johnson's Tories won the December 2019 poll, the economy, immigration, defence and tax have grown in importance in the eyes of the electorate. This has come amid the cost of living crisis; small boats crossing the English Channel; the onset of the Ukraine war and wider global instability; and the highest tax burden in 70 years.Housing has also become a bigger concern, with the Renters Reform Bill - in which the government pledged to scrap no-fault evictions - having been paused after Sunak called the election.Meanwhile, the last general election was fought - and won by the Tories - on a single issue: Brexit. Yet the chart shows a clear downturn in its relevance among voters, particularly after a trade deal was agreed with the EU in December 2020.This next chart, meanwhile, highlights what voters have considered the top issues over the past year. By a wide margin, the top three are the economy, health and immigration and asylum.Here, Yahoo News UK breaks down what is behind these issues and how they have ebbed and flowed in importance among voters since the last election in 2019.The economyThe unprecedented lockdown called by Boris Johnson in March 2020 meant the public’s attention shifted to the economy, as demonstrated by the huge spike in the chart above. The then-chancellor Rishi Sunak was forced to implement a £70bn furlough scheme, lasting 18 months, to protect people’s jobs.There was a second almighty economic shock - and rise in public concern - in February 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This caused a further spike in an already turbulent wholesale energy market, driving up costs for suppliers and ultimately customers.Average energy bills eventually reached £2,500 a year (and would have exceeded £4,000 had the government not intervened). This was double the £1,278 consumers were paying before the war and by the time this election takes place, people will still be paying much more than this: £1,568.Energy prices were also a key driver in inflation reaching 11.1% - a 41-year high - by October 2022, though it has since fallen to 2.3%, which is near the Bank of England’s 2.0% target.The third economic shock of this parliament - and most damaging for the Tories - was in October 2022 when Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng's disastrous “mini budget”, containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, prompted an economic crisis. It led to soaring interest rates, and to this day homeowners who are remortgaging are facing significantly higher bills.HealthHealth, like the economy, is another issue which clearly correlated with the beginning of the pandemic. The above chart shows an enormous spike in public concern when COVID cases started to multiply in March 2020, ultimately leading to the nationwide lockdown as the NHS faced collapse.Cases fell that summer, but spikes in the chart can be seen once infections rose again and fresh nationwide lockdowns were imposed in October 2020 and January 2021. By March 2022, likely as concerns over the Omicron variant faded, there was much less concern about health.In January last year, there was a brief spike as the NHS in England experienced the biggest industrial action in its history, with tens of thousands of nurses and ambulance staff walking out simultaneously.As for the state of play going into the election, NHS waiting lists remain higher than they were when Sunak vowed to cut them last year. According to the latest figures, an estimated 7.54 million treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of March, relating to 6.29 million patients.Immigration and asylumSince the last election, the immigration and asylum narrative has largely revolved around one issue: small boats crossing the English Channel.The numbers have risen in most of the intervening years: there were 1,843 crossings in 2019, 8,466 in 2020, 28,526 in 2021, 45,774 in 2022 and 29,437 last year. This year, the number has already passed the 10,000 mark.The regular sharp spikes in the above chart demonstrate how frequently crossings have been in the news, including some occasions when hundreds of migrants have made the dangerous journey in a single day.But it also reflects how the government has made this part of its own agenda. It was Boris Johnson’s government which first announced plans to deport migrants to Rwanda in April 2022. That policy was picked up by Rishi Sunak when he became prime minister in October that year, with Sunak since repeating his pledge to “stop the boats”.But after calling the election, Sunak admitted this week that flights would not take off before the country goes to the polls.Read moreFive important laws that could be dropped due to Sunak's snap election (Yahoo News UK)OPINION - Rishi Sunak has been in last-ditch campaign mode for so long — a General Election is logical (Evening Standard)Door open for Boris Johnson to campaign for Tories, Rishi Sunak signals (PA Media)"

Oo arr, it be possible alright: Chippy, as they call it, is in fact a former mill town and has been attached to the redrawn Banbury constituency, turning Victoria Prentis’s 17,000 majority into a marginal. The Labour revolution knows no limits.

No pigs, no muck; the only hint of the arable was a reporter relieving himself in a bush. I’d swear the soil had been swept and the logs washed, with bundles of neat faggots placed artistically around hay bails trimmed by Vidal Sassoon. It reminded one colleague of the musical Oklahoma, another of the set of a porn movie he’d seen featuring barnyard action so raw it got banned in the Netherlands. Either way, that journalist’s mind was the filthiest thing there.The Keir Starmer Tour enters its sixth and final week and he’s probably never met a voter.

Keir patted the dear man on the shoulder. Chin up. This time next week, he could be foreign secretary.“It’s time for change!” shouted Rachel in her Supreme Dalek voice, stopping short at “resistance is futile” (the media training is paying off). Keir promised us a “summer of change”, adding that Labour has “a smile in our face and a spring in our step”.

Keir repeated his talking points to a broadcaster; Rachel charmed the activists (“You will obey!”); Darren Thingumy looked like a nice young man you’d happily bring home to meet mother.Then they hopped back on the bus, presumably to repeat this bizarre exercise at various Tory locations, including a riding stables, a marrow contest and Lord Cameron’s back garden.

The one person who will never take that action is Rishi Sunak, a man too weak to enforce basic standards within his own party.”Mr Ashworth claimed there are “166 hardcore Trussites” standing for the Conservatives on Thursday, adding: “Most of them share the core ‘Pop-Con’ belief which is that Trussonomics was sabotaged by the so-called big state establishment in the autumn of 2022 and has never been given a proper chance to succeed.”Shadow paymaster general Jonathan Ashworth gives a speech during a press event at in central London (Lucy North/PA Wire)Exclusive: Next prime minister urged to dump Sunak’s post-Brexit wine tax15:53 , Salma OuaguiraSir Keir Starmer is being urged to dump Rishi Sunak’s ‘sneaky’ post-Brexit wine tax if he wins the keys to Downing Street this week, Kate Devlin reports.Britain’s wine drinkers face a little-known ‘sauvignon surcharge’ from February, as part of changes brought in after the UK left the European Union.As the prime minister uses the election campaign to repeatedly accuse Labour of planning secret tax rises if they get into power, experts and industry leaders today call for his booze levy to be dropped. ‘Sauvignon surcharge’: Next prime minister urged to dump Sunak post-Brexit wine taxCorbyn tells Keir to be more like Blair15:41 , Salma OuaguiraJeremy Corbyn has told Sir Keir Starmer to be more like Tony Blair and appoint “socialist figures” in his Cabinet if he gets into Downing Street.Speaking to i, the former Labour leader labelled Sir Keir’s leadership “authoritarian” and a “straitjacket of conformity”.He said his shadow cabinet contrasts with Sir Tony’s close allies including Left-wingers Frank Dobson and Robin Cook.The independent candidate said: “I don’t see any appetite for political diversity by the Labour leadership at all.”He added: “You’ve got to keep the trust of people. If they crush dissent in the Labour Party, which they’ve been very good at doing then they actually give themselves a fool’s paradise of agreement and they have driven the other people out, who are actually very constructive.”The criticism comes after the once-party colleagues fell out after Mr Corbyn was kicked out of the party.Sir Keir previously claimed he was “certain” his predecessor was going to lose the 2019 election.Britain Landmark Elections 1997 (AP1997)Tory MP who used Nigel Farage on campaign leaflet falls out spectacularly with Reform15:32 , Salma OuaguiraA Brexiteer Tory MP who used a picture of Nigel Farage on her campaign leaflet has fallen out spectacularly with his party Reform UK, David Maddox reports.Andrea Jenkyns claimed she was wooed by a pro-Brexit businessman acting on behalf of Reform who she says offered her jobs to defect.The MP has described a number of meetings with Arron Banks - including going to Nigel Farage’s birthday party as his plus 1 - as Reform under Richard Tice’s leadership tried to pressure her to switch parties ahead of the election.But the meetings prompted fevered speculation before the election that Ms Jenkyns might defect to Reform and led to revelations of her efforts to strike a deal between them and the Tories.Ms Jenkyn’s allegations have been denied by Reform and Mr Banks, but the row has echoes of claims made by Lee Anderson, denied by Tice and Reform, that he was offered £80,000 a year to defect before he was suspended by the Tories.

So yes, we will work with whoever.“I do think it is important that we make the progressive case to meet the challenges that we face across Europe and across the world.”The comments come after Sir Keir claimed the only capable of beating the far right in Europe is the Left.Ms Le Pen’s National Rally party won the first round of France’s parliamentary election on Sunday.Tories accused of ‘hollowing out’ defence as historic regiments culled15:14 , Salma OuaguiraTories accused of ‘hollowing out’ Britain’s defence as historic regiments culledRory Stewart warns Tories ‘not to try Le Pen' at home15:08 , Salma OuaguiraRory Stewart has warned the Conservatives not to replicate Marine Le Pen’s “populism”.The former One Nation MP and cabinet minister said the Tories cannot resurface from the defeating opinion polls by “appealing to the populist right”.Instead, he urged the party to “retake the centre”.Declaring that he would not vote for Labour, he told Times Radio: “The fantasy seems to be that if they bring in nice, good-willed people from difficult backgrounds, everything’s going to be fine.“I don’t feel that they have yet taken on board just how difficult government is. So I’m very, very worried that this is going to be a very stale, inactive government that’s going to be using class warfare as a cover for inaction.”Starmer dismisses questions about working with Putin if elected15:00 , Salma OuaguiraSir Keir Starmer has dismissed questions on whether he would meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin if he were to become prime minister.Speaking during a campaign visit to Buckingham and Bletchley, the Labour leader told reporters: “Look at the moment that is simply not an issue. He is the aggressor in Ukraine, and the most important thing is to be absolutely clear that our support for Ukraine is on a united front in this country.“And the current Government and us as the Opposition have spoken with one voice since the outbreak of this conflict. That was a deliberate decision that I took.“I’ve been to see President Zelensky in Kyiv myself personally to say, should there be a change of government, there won’t be any change in our support for Ukraine.”He continued: “Without getting ahead of ourselves, obviously, an important event next week is the Nato summit in Washington, where one of the big issues will be the continued support for Ukraine.” (Stefan Rousseau/PA Wire)Farage: Marine Le Pen’s win in France would be a ‘disaster’14:52 , Salma OuaguiraWith Marine Le Pen’s party at the gates of power in the polls, UK politicians have reacted to the possibility of having a right-wing French government as the new neighbours.Sir Keir Starmer said this morning that only the Left can beat rising far right parties across Europe, and Rishi Sunak dodged questions about a potential victory.But Nigel Farage hasn’t hold back.

Thursday.The party said it was “flooded” with £400,000 of donations in 24 hours, and that in the month of the General Election campaign the party’s membership had doubled from 30,000 to 60,000.Reform claims the donations came from “grass-roots” support spurred on by the party’s event held in Birmingham at the weekend, despite last week’s allegations of racism as a result of comments emerging from the Clacton division of the campaign.The £1 million advertising campaign across national newspapers and websites will seek to drive home the message that only Reform UK will be able to mount an effective opposition to a Labour government.Party leader Nigel Farage said he was “blown away by the generosity of so many ordinary people who are sick of what is happening to this country”.Over the past week Mr Farage has faced accusations from across the political divide of failing to tackle allegations of racism within Reform which have engulfed the party.Exclusive: Windrush pensioner facing

They were racist and appalling.“And the person who made them has apologised to Reform for the impact it’s had on them.“And as I said, you’ve got now multiple Reform candidates and campaigners openly espousing racist and misogynistic views, seemingly without challenge, tells you something about the culture within the Reform Party.”Sunak says he is proud of disastrous election campaign - and claims he will win13:10 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak says he is proud of disastrous election campaign - and claims he will winJoin our virtual event examining the election results13:00 , Salma OuaguiraOur expert panel will be analysing the major triumphs, biggest setbacks and key outcomes for each of the UK’s major political parties.Hosted by our chief political commentator John Rentoul, this event will also offer a deep dive into the immediate and long-term challenges facing the newly elected government, including immigration, the cost of living, the NHS, education, Brexit and more.Our panel includes The Independent’s own Andrew Grice, a political columnist and former political editor from 1998 to 2015.

But fast forward to 2024 and not only is Mr Corbyn not Labour leader, he is no longer a member of the party he championed for 40 years, and is instead running as an independent.Unfortunately for the man who has served Islington North since 1983, not all of his supporters appear to know that, and that could at least partly explain why the veteran campaigner appears to have a real fight on his hands despite winning a majority of 26,000 in 2019.You can read The Independent’s full story hereThen Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn (right) alongside shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer during a press conference in central London in 2019 Jonathan Brady/PA) (PA Archive)12:24 , Salma OuaguiraSwinney: ‘Nothing that can be done’ about delayed postal votes in Scotland12:16 , Salma OuaguiraScotland’s first minister John Swinney has said there is “nothing that can be done” about delays in postal votes across Scotland.The SNP leader said there had been various reports of people not receiving their vote ahead of polling day.And the Electoral Management Board for Scotland said there had been “many difficulties experienced with the delivery of postal votes” across the country.But Mr Swinney said: “Unfortunately, there is nothing that can be done. There are no other proxy arrangements that can be put in place, but I think it’s illustrative of the fact that there was no thought given to summer school holidays.”Sunak urges voters to stop a Labour ‘supermajority'12:07 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak has warned voters against a “Labour supermajority” on Thursday.Speaking from Staffordshire, the prime minister said:“But when you go to the polls on Thursday you have to remember this is not a by-election. This is a choice about who governs our country for years and I would urge you not to sleepwalk into that, think about what that will mean for you and your family and the impact that’ll have.“In particular, if these polls are right, and Labour are in power with a supermajority, you have to think about what that will mean – a Labour government unchecked, no-one to hold them accountable, no-one to stand up to them in Parliament and all of the impact it would have on all of your lives.”Watch: Cheaper to put asylum seekers up in Ritz than Rwanda plan, Labour says11:52 , Salma OuaguiraCheaper to put asylum seekers up in Ritz than Rwanda plan, Labour saysPM urges voters don’t give Labour ‘a blank cheque’11:36 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak has warned voters backing Labour would mean handing Sir Keir Starmer a “blank cheque”.He said: “I tell you this: once you have handed Keir Starmer and Labour a blank cheque, you won’t be able to get it back.”The prime minister added Labour will scrap the Tory plan to fly asylum seekers to Rwanda, adding the opposition has “no answers on securing borders and immigration”."
PA Media: UK News,‘One person disenfranchised is one too many’ – Sarwar on postal vote delays,[],"Neil Pooran, PA Scotland Political Correspondent",1 July 2024 at 6:15 am·2-min read,1,July,2024,06:15:00,2,"Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says if even one person is disenfranchised due to postal voting delays it is “one too many”.He became the latest political leader to voice concerns about problems caused by voters not receiving their postal ballots when they expected.As the Scottish school holidays have now begun, a number of councils have set up emergency stations where people can be re-issued with their postal ballots.Over the weekend, SNP leader John Swinney and Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey also said they are worried about voters missing out due to not receiving postal ballots before they fly off on holiday.Mr Sarwar was asked about the issue as he spoke to journalists on a visit to the fabrication halls at Harland and Wolff’s yard in Methil, Fife.He said: “I’m deeply concerned across the board, because one person disenfranchised is one person too many, regardless of their politics, regardless of who they vote for, because that’s the fundamentals of our democracy.“And I’m aware of several cases already of people who have left to go on holiday and didn’t receive their postal votes on time. That is not acceptable.”The Scottish Labour leader said it is important to “minimise any damage done”, and called on the Electoral Commission, election management boards and the Royal Mail to urgently address the issue.He also said councils should take a “consistent” approach to setting up the emergency postal vote stations to avoid any confusion.This election is our chance to deliver jobs, investment and growth to Scotland.Delighted to visit Harland & Wolff in Methil today with @Baker4Lab and @IanMurrayMP. pic.twitter.com/2lVM1u23ME— Anas Sarwar (@AnasSarwar) July 1, 2024At the weekend, Mr Swinney said there appeared to have been little consideration given to the issue of Scotland’s summer school holidays.If voters are overseas on polling day before they have cast their postal ballot, they will not be able to vote, he said.Speaking to Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips on Sky News, Mr Swinney said: “Unfortunately, there is nothing that can be done.“They have to be here to be able to exercise their postal vote, if it’s been delivered to the house, or if there is an alternative arrangement in place.“There are no other proxy arrangements that can be put in place, but I think it’s illustrative of the fact there was no thought given to summer school holidays.”"
