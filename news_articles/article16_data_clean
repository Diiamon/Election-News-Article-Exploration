Evening Standard,Election date betting row: Keir Starmer accuses Rishi Sunak of 'total lack of leadership',[],Jitendra Joshi,21 June 2024 at 10:14 am·4-min read,21,June,2024,10:14:00,4,"Rishi Sunak was accused on Friday of a “total lack of leadership” as the Prime Minister struggled to move on from a growing scandal about bets on the election timing allegedly placed by Tory insiders.Sir Keir Starmer said: “If they were my candidates, they’d be gone by now, out of the door.”The Liberal Democrats meanwhile demanded the release of any WhatsApp messages related to the alleged bets sent or received by members of the PM’s “inner circle”.Addressing a BBC Question Time audience on Thursday night, the Prime Minister refused to suspend two Conservative candidates who are under investigation by the Gambling Commission.Laura Saunders and Craig Williams currently remain Tory candidates for the July 4 election with the blessing of Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ).Ms Saunders’ husband Tony Lee is also reportedly under investigation by the Gambling Commission, and the party said he had taken a leave of absence from his job as CCHQ’s director of campaigns.A fourth individual - a police officer in the PM’s personal security detail - has been arrested and suspended from operational duties.Mr Sunak on Friday repeated that he would not “compromise the integrity” of probes into the betting allegations when pressed repeatedly on why he was not suspending the two candidates.“There are multiple investigations that are very serious in nature that are currently ongoing with the police involved, because there’s potentially criminal allegations involved in all of this,” he said, while restating his sense of anger.Asked what he was angry about, Mr Sunak said “the thought that someone might have done the things that are alleged”, denying his anger was about the scandal overshadowing his beleaguered campaign.The PM was trying to launch the Conservatives’ manifesto in Wales, but he was besieged by questions over the betting affair instead.Mr Williams, an outgoing MP, was a parliamentary aide to Mr Sunak and is standing again for Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr.According to the latest MRP projection from YouGov, the constituency is the only one in Wales that the Tories will hold onto.On a campaign visit to Scotland, the Labour leader said: “The Prime Minister is showing a total lack of leadership.Sir Keir added: “Let’s look at what actually happened. In relation to a General Election, the instincts of these Tories when a General Election is called is not how do we make this work for the country? But how do I make some money? And that tells you a broader picture about politics.“Of course he should suspend these candidates... He needs to take tough action. He’s not even saying today whether there are more involved.”Mr Sunak’s Cabinet ally Welsh Secretary David TC Davies said that he did not know if any other names were to come out.Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme if he was worried about the party’s reputation in light of various ethics questions including the Partygate scandal, Mr Davies replied: “Well, of course I am.”He added on Sky News: “It’s totally unacceptable if people have broken the rules in any way, there is an investigation going on by the Gambling Commission and I welcome that, and anyone who is found to have broken the rules will be kicked out of the Conservative Party.”But Lib Dem Treasury spokeswoman Sarah Olney insisted: “WhatsApp messages of the Prime Minister’s inner circle must be handed over to the Cabinet Office, or else it raises suspicion of yet more Conservative cover-ups.“We can’t have another Partygate moment where Whatsapp messages suddenly disappear when the heat is on,” she told the Standard. “The public deserves the truth. Full transparency is needed to end the endless chaos and scandal at the heart of the Conservative Party.”Conservative Home founder Tim Montgomerie told Times Radio that “half a dozen more people in Tory HQ are apparently under investigation”, but that was denied by a party source.Mr Montgomerie added that Tory members and activists were “shell-shocked” over the betting news, which has intensified the pressure on Mr Sunak amid a slew of devastating opinion polls and the news from former Tory net zero czar Chris Skidmore that he intends to vote Labour for the first time.Mr Davies said he was “not in the least bit bothered about” Mr Skidmore’s announcement, claiming that his former colleague was “distracted” having taken on well-paid work in the renewable energy industry."

The Independent,How Sir Keir Starmer set a trap for Boris Johnson over Partygate scandal,[],Archie Mitchell,22 June 2024 at 8:46 am·3-min read,22,June,2024,08:46:00,3,"Sir Keir Starmer has set out for the first time how he laid a trap for Boris Johnson over Partygate, luring the former prime minister into the lies that saw him forced out of parliament.The Labour leader, and Britain’s former chief prosecutor, said he knew Mr Johnson’s instinct under pressure was to lie and detailed how he “forensically” led the then prime minister into misleading the House of Commons.Mr Johnson sensationally quit as an MP last summer before facing the verdict of parliament’s privileges committee, which was to rule he lied about the scandal of lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street.Sir Keir Starmer has set out how he forensically trapped Boris Johnson in a web of lies over Partygate (Getty)Branding him the first former PM to have lied to the Commons, the privileges committee found Mr Johnson committed “repeated contempt” of parliament by deliberately misleading MPs over lockdown-busting parties before being complicit in a campaign of abuse and intimidation.Sanctions against Mr Johnson included banning him from having a pass to access P arliament, which is usually available to former MPs. He would also have faced a 90-day suspension if he had not already quit.In an interview with The Guardian, Sir Keir lashed out at Mr Johnson as “a guy who is detached from the truth”.“Whether he’s lying or not, it doesn’t matter to him,” Sir Keir said.And he laid out the specific and intentional way he set a trap for Mr Johnson over the Partygate saga.He told the paper: “When I first asked him, ‘Did you apply all the rules?’ I hadn’t seen the video of Allegra [Stratton, Johnson’s director of strategic communications]. But he was told about her laughing in response to being asked, ‘What do we say about the parties?’“So I said [to my team], ‘I think there’s something here. Let’s get him on record. Because his instinct will be to lie.’ It was a thread that we pulled over months. I was less bothered by what he was saying to me than trying to be forensic and getting him on the record.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he knew Boris Johnson’s instinct under pressure was to lie (PA)“It paid dividends in the end. He had to leave parliament – because he’d lied.”A report into Downing Street parties by former top civil servant Sue Gray laid bare a culture of repeated violations of the Covid restrictions by senior officials in No 10.It contained multiple photographs of ex-PM Mr Johnson and one of his successor Rishi Sunak attending a birthday gathering with his old boss.Mr Sunak and Mr Johnson both received Metropolitan Police fines for the event, which took place on 19 June, 2020.Britain’s top polling guru Professor Sir John Curtice has said one of the main reasons for the Tories’ electoral woes, with Mr Sunak’s party on course for a 1997-style wipeout, is because of the legacy left by Partygate."
Yahoo News UK,Who is Ed Davey? Lib Dem leader attracts attention with election stuntsEverything you need to know about the former minister who has pledged to fight for the NHS.,[],Hannah Fearn,7 June 2024 at 10:47 am·7-min read,7,June,2024,10:47:00,7,"Ed Davey has been involved in a number of comedy stunts since the election was called. (Alamy) With the spotlight on prime minister Rishi Sunak and Labour leader Keir Starmer as they prepare to slug it out in a general election campaign, the focus had started slipping from Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey until a series of stunts put him back in the spotlight.The former coalition government cabinet minister - who lost his seat, punished by voters for getting into bed with the Tories, but then won it back again - is sending a clear message that he should not be overlooked.He’s had a long political career and the climax may still be ahead: if polls continue to shift away from the Conservatives at the current trajectory, there’s a slim possibility that, if the election is held in October, he could end up as Leader of the Opposition.So what do we know about the man behind the third party in British politics? Hannah Fearn finds out.His early lifeEd Davey was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on Christmas Day in 1965. He was the youngest of three boys, but lost his father at just four years old, and his mother followed over a decade later when he was in his mid-teens. She spent three years battling cancer, during which time he nursed his mother together with his grandmother and brother Henry.Once a keen Scout and Air Scout, he later remembers feeling “isolated” at school because of his caring responsibilities, which meant he couldn’t take part in after-school activities or sports. “The last 18 months she was bedridden and in a lot of pain. I’d spend hours on the bed, talking to her,” he said. Davey was with his mother when she died at Nottingham General Hospital, after being placed on an unsuited dementia ward.After both his parents had died, Davey was brought up by his maternal grandparents in the village of Eakring, though his grandfather died soon after. He spent much of his childhood and young adulthood close to his grandmother. “First of all, she was looking after me. Then we were looking after each other,” he said.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

Gasson stood in four elections but failed to win a seat and is now a councillor. The pair have two children, a son and daughter.Their son, born in 2007 and now a teenager, is disabled with a neurological condition. He attended special schools but is now educated at home with a tutor - a change that Davey said led to him becoming verbal for the first time. He has spoken about his anxiety about who will care for his son when he and his wife are no longer around. “It’s the thing that worries me more than anything else in my life,” he said.Gasson was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in 2012. She was well for many years following her diagnosis, but declined during lockdown and is working on recovering her physical strength.Liberal Democrats election broadcast shows Ed Davey with his son. (Liberal Democrats)His parentsHis father, John, was a solicitor and his mother, Nina, a teacher. Davey has described how he was inspired to study by his mother, who always wanted him to try hard academically and who he wanted to impress.His educationDavey attended the private Nottingham High School, the alma mater of former chancellor Kenneth Clarke. He became head boy, with Labour MP Ed Balls - who was studying in the year below - watching on. After school, he achieved a first class degree in philosophy, politics and economics at Jesus College, Oxford where he was junior common room president. After becoming an economics research for the Liberal Democrats he returned to study, reading for a master’s degree in economics at Birkbeck College, London.Ed Davey, pictured with his family. (Liberal Democrats)Why is he a sir?For three years, the Lib Dem leader was a member of the cabinet during the period of Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, holding the post of secretary of state for energy and climate change from 2012 to 2015. He was knighted in the 2016 New Year’s Honours for “political and public services”.Davey on... the cost of living crisisDavey has repeatedly attacked the government for failing to curb rapid inflation and the devastating effect it is having on household budgets. He called the Conservative Party “so out of touch they might as well be living on another planet”, and said he warned Jeremy Hunt “people are desperate for real help… but all the chancellor could offer is empty words and unfair tax hikes”. In particular, he has urged more action on food price inflation, which analysis from his own party found had risen 37 per cent in one year for the average weekly supermarket trip. He has promised to end energy hikes and abandoned his plan to add 1p to income tax to save the NHS because ordinary voters can no longer afford it.Davey on... the NHSThe Liberal Democrats have made the NHS a cornerstone of their policy platform for the last five years. In Davey’s words: “Voting Conservative is bad for your health.” He promises to reverse cuts to GP numbers and guarantee a doctor’s appointment when you need one, improve access to NHS dentistry and save lives by tackling ambulance call out delays. Davey blames the care crisis for deepening the problems of the health service and says his party would spend £5bn a year on a “care package” to ensure patients are discharged from hospital more quickly, freeing up bed space. However, there is little detail on how this would be financed without raising taxes on the wealthiest - which Davey has promised not to do in his push to poach disillusioned Tory voters.British Leader of the Liberal Democrats party Ed Davey arrives at the BBC Broadcasting House, for his appearance on 'Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg', in London, Britain, April 28, 2024. REUTERS/Maja SmiejkowskaDavey on... immigrationThe Lib Dem leader has been a long-standing advocate for refugee rights and critic of the government’s immigration policy. He has called for Conservative plans to deport failed asylum seekers to Rwanda a “cynical distraction” from the partygate crisis and the money would be better spent on measures to tackle the cost of living crisis. He added: “They’ve provided no evidence to suggest that this new policy will stop illegal smuggling, they’re not cracking down on the organised crime gangs, which is what you need to do.” He has called for a new right to work for refugees and asylum seekers, and major reform of the Home Office which he says is no longer up to the job. After the end of the coalition government, Davey has said his party “was wrong” to go along with the introduction of a minimum income standard for immigrants. He later described the policy as “nasty and unfair”.Davey on... the Post Office scandalDespite the Horizon scandal that led to the wrongful prosecution of more than 700 subpostmasters crossing the tenure of more than a dozen business secretaries, Ed Davey has recently taken the heat for failing to investigate the issue while he was in the job.It has emerged that Davey initially rejected a request to meet justice campaigner Alan Bates, and later accepted it only on the advice that it would be good for his PR. He has recently apologised for not acting earlier, admitting that he is sorry that he “did not see through Post Office lies” about the fault in the Horizon programme."
Yahoo News UK,Who will win the next general election? Latest polls and oddsThree new polls have each projected a seismic victory for Labour - with one even suggesting Rishi Sunak could lose his seat.,"[""Tories to slump to lowest number of seats since party's formation"", 'Conservatives on course for worst defeat in over a century', 'Sunak to lose seat in Tory wipeout, major poll predicts', 'What are the latest odds?', 'What went wrong for the Tories?']",James Cheng-Morris and  James Hockaday,Updated 19 June 2024 at 0:08 pm·8-min read,19,June,2024,00:08:00,8,"Three polls released in the space of an hour have indicated that Rishi Sunak is on course for a crushing defeat in the upcoming general election - with one report suggesting he could become the first sitting prime minister to lose his seat.The polls published on Wednesday evening were commissioned by the Telegraph, Sky and the News Agents podcast. All the polls use the multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP) technique, which enables projections to be made at constituency level.And while all three polls indicate Sunak faces an uphill battle to avoid a major defeat, there is a significant disparity from all three as to how far ahead Keir Starmer actually is.Yahoo summaries the key points of the three pollsTories to slump to lowest number of seats since party's formationYouGov's polling for Sky News projects Labour is on course to achieve a 200-seat majority. Labour is predicted to secure 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.This projection would show the Tories plummeting from the 365 won by Boris Johnson in the 2019 election and give the party their lowest ever number of MPs. It would also give Starmer more seats than the 418 won by Tony Blair in 1997. Read a full report of this poll from Sky NewsThe YouGov poll for Sky News.Conservatives on course for worst defeat in over a centuryAccording to polling by More In Common UK for the News Agents podcast, Labour is projected to finish on 406 seats, a majority of 162.

This polling puts Labour on a massive 516 seats, with the Tories on only 53 - just in front of the Lib Dems on 50 - a forecast that would be remarkable were it to be reflected on polling night.

Given the nature of these seat totals, it is natural to be slightly sceptical.""It adds: ""Not every MRP is the same. The statistical 'building blocks' used to model voter behaviour will vary from pollster to pollster, which will in turn lead to different vote shares and seat totals. All different pollsters will get different national vote share.""The MRP methodology, as described by YouGov, ""uses data at the constituency level to predict the outcomes of seats based on the concentration of various different types of voters who live there"".Stuart Wilks-Heeg, writing in The Conversation earlier this month, points out some of the other limitations of MRP polling: ""There are ... factors MRPs cannot take into account. Some constituency results will be influenced by locally specific issues that statistical models can’t capture. For example, adjustments cannot be made for who the candidates are in each constituency and whether any have a profile that could enhance, or detract from, their party’s chance of winning. Think Nigel Farage standing for Reform UK in Clacton.""And competing MRPs produce contrasting outcomes because each model uses specific assumptions and data. Different inputs produce different outputs. This election has seen more MRPs produced than ever before, and from various organisations. In the early hours of July 5, we’ll know which one came closest to getting the result correct.""What are the latest odds?As of 19 June, Oddschecker – a website which compares odds across different bookmakers – had Labour at 1/41 to win the most seats. To put that in context, this is seen as so likely that a £10 bet would return just £10.24.The Conservatives are 40/1 to win the most seats, a scenario seen as so unlikely that a £10 punt would return £410.What went wrong for the Tories?YouGov's voting intention tracker between January 2020 and June 2024. (YouGov)So, why have the polls changed so dramatically? It's worth looking back on an extremely eventful four-and-a-half years in UK politics.According to YouGov's voting intention tracker (see chart, above), Tory support peaked at 53%, with Labour on 32%, in April 2020, months after the party's stunning success in the 2019 general election and Boris Johnson's pledge to “get Brexit done”. That month also saw Starmer take over as Labour leader from Jeremy Corbyn.This was also amid a spirit of national unity following the onset of the COVID pandemic which nearly killed Johnson himself. The then-PM had been released from hospital five days before this particular survey was taken.Boris Johnson delivers his final speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street in September 2022. (AFP via Getty Images)Over the rest of the year, there was a downturn in support amid chaos over COVID rules, with the Tories falling as low as 35% in November 2020, compared to Labour on 40%.However, the UK’s successful COVID vaccination programme provided a pathway out of lockdown and with it, improved poll ratings. Tory support peaked at 41% in June 2021, with Labour at 30%.In October that year, there was a sense Johnson was untouchable. At the Tory party conference, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg remarked how the PM was ""in total command of his party, and politically dominant in the country"".But this fell apart quickly with the Partygate scandal, which emerged in November that year. Time and again, reports emerged of government and Tory staff – including Johnson – having taken part in lockdown-era social gatherings when their own COVID rules had prohibited them.By January 2022, Tory support had plummeted to 28%, with Labour on 38%. Johnson struggled on, but never recovered and a wave of ministerial resignations forced him to resign in July that year.The UK had three separate prime ministers – Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak – between 6 September and 24 October, 2022. (Getty Images)His successor, Liz Truss, then embarked on arguably the most disastrous prime ministerial reign in history, characterised by the catastrophic ""mini-budget"", containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, which prompted an economic crisis. Like Johnson, she lost the confidence of Tory MPs – and voters – and had to resign.Her 49-day spell as PM was the shortest in history, with Tory support plummeting to 19% (with Labour on 56%) the day after she announced her resignation in October 2022.Rishi Sunak, who had lost to Truss in the previous month's Tory leadership election, took over. However, as the above YouGov chart indicates, he has failed to cut through with voters. Tory support was at 23% two days after he assumed office, with the most recent survey, carried out on Thursday, showing support is now lower than under Truss at 18%.In short, the polls and odds, not to mention other factors such as notable by-election victories for Starmer's Labour, are pointing to a Labour government next month.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

Yahoo News UK,"Chart shows just how historic Rishi Sunak’s election defeat could beWith the Tories so far behind in the polls, these historical graphs emphasise how bad a defeat the party is facing.",[],James Cheng-Morris,Updated 21 June 2024 at 2:39 pm·4-min read,21,June,2024,02:39:00,4,"One of the UK's foremost elections expert has spelt out what the general election polls have been telling him.“In terms of vote share, the Conservatives are, at the moment, heading for their worst performance since the First World War… by a country mile,"" Prof Sir John Curtice told the BBC on Thursday morning.For Rishi Sunak, it was another stark reminder of the electoral disaster he is battling to avoid on 4 July, with a major YouGov study the day before having said the Conservatives are projected to slump to their “lowest seat tally in the party’s almost 200-year history”.YouGov said its study - based on the multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) technique and the responses of 36,000 people - projects Labour to win 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.It noted such a scenario would hand Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer a 200-seat majority in the Commons.Sir Keir Starmer on the campaign trail in Scotland on Friday. (PA)High-profile Conservative casualties forecast in the projection include chancellor Jeremy Hunt, who would lose his Godalming and Ash seat to the Liberal Democrats, and defence secretary Grant Shapps, who would lose Welwyn Hatfield to Labour.The situation has become so dire that senior party figures are now openly warning of a Starmer “supermajority” for Labour, suggesting the party is now focused on damage limitation rather than winning the vote on 4 July.Essentially, Sunak - who pledged on Thursday's Question Time election special that he would keep going - is facing a historically bad result.The below chart shows the party's vote share in general elections since 1906...... and YouGov's MRP suggested the Tories would win just 22% of the vote. This would be the worst vote share out of all these 31 elections - not even close to the previous low of 31% in 1997.The following two charts, meanwhile, show the percentage of seats won by the Tories and the number of seats won by the party.It's worth reflecting on some of the most significantly bad Tory results in recent history.First, there is 1906, when the Tories won 156 seats (23% of those available). That election, like this year's, came after a long period - 11 years - of Conservative rule. Sunak's Tories have been in power for 14 years.It was a landslide result for the Liberals, with the Journal of Liberal History suggesting ""the result reflected an overwhelming rejection of Conservative policies... the [Liberal] slogan of free trade was a policy that resonated with a broad audience, reluctant to see food prices rise as a result of the Conservative inclination towards tariff reform"".Another notable defeat in the above charts was 1945, when Winston Churchill's government was booted out off the back of the Second World War.Winston Churchill leaving Downing Street in July 1945 after the Conservative defeat. (Getty Images)The Tories won 210 seats (33% of those available) in their worst result since 1906. Given Churchill's lauded wartime leadership, this may come as a surprise.But for James Taylor of the Imperial War Museum, his wartime leadership was the point: ""I think the key reason for Churchill's defeat is that he's seen above all as war leader. Churchill's overriding priority was victory over Nazi Germany and then Japan.""But British voters wanted real social change as well, they wanted a leader who would win the peace and they did not see Churchill as that leader.""Finally, the election from recent times that Sunak's campaign could potentially most closely resemble is that of 1997, when Labour won a landslide 179-seat majority.Again, 1997 was another campaign which had followed a long period - 18 years - of the Tories in office. With no answer to Tony Blair's New Labour platform, William Hague's party won only 165 seats (25% of those available). Still, this would be far more than the Tories are currently projected to win.In addition, this chart also demonstrates just how pronounced the swing was between Labour and the Tories in 1945 and 1997.However, amid all this talk about projections, it’s worth remembering they are still only polls and not a definite indicator of how people will vote on 4 July.The 1992 and 2015 elections are notable examples of how polling didn’t match the end results of Tory wins.Ahead of the 2015 result, many polls predicted a hung parliament. In the end, David Cameron's Tories won 331 seats - a 12 seat majority. Could the polls be wrong again?Read more: Pollsters got it wrong in 2015, so could Labour’s lead be overestimated?

The term is also sometimes used to refer to the election itself, as in ‘they could not win at the ballot box’.CampaignThe time before an election in which politicians persuade people to vote for them. In the case of the 2024 election in the UK, parliament was dissolved on the 30 May and the election will take place on 4 July.CanvassingGoing round a particular area trying to persuade people to vote for one party or the other.In UK elections, this is often done by volunteers knocking on people’s doors.Capital gains taxCapital gains tax is a tax on profit when people sell assets that have increased in value.In the 2024 election, the Conservatives have promised that landlords who sell to sitting tenants will be spared capital gains tax on the proceeds, while Labour has left the door open to raising capital gains.Child benefitChild benefit is a benefit paid to parents with children under 16 (or under 20 in approved education or training).The Conservatives have promised to increase the threshold at which high earners start to lose the benefit from £60,000 to £120,000.Sir Keir Starmer, like the Conservatives, has pledged not to raise VAT.

For example, both the 2010 election and 2017 elections resulted in hung parliament.In 2010, the Conservatives formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, while in 2017, the Conservatives formed a minority government with a 'confidence and supply' agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).Income tax thresholdThe thresholds between the tax-free allowance, basic rate tax and higher rates of tax.Both parties have said they will continue the freeze on income tax thresholds brought in under the Conservatives, which means people pay more tax as more and more people are pushed into higher tax brackets if wages rise.MajorityA party with a majority – more than half of the seats in the House of Commons – has won the election.The number of votes by which an individual MP wins a constituency is also referred to as their majority.ManifestoPolitical parties publish manifestos before a general election, with a set of policies that the party stands for and aims to implement if elected.Manifesto pledges are not legally binding.Marginal seatA seat in which the incumbent MP won by a small majority, meaning a swing is more likely than in a so-called ‘safe seat’ where the MP had a large majority.Net zeroThe UK Government has set a goal for Britain’s emissions to reach net zero – where emission and removal of greenhouse gases reaches equilibrium – by 2050.All major parties are expected to stick to this goal, barring Reform UK.Opinion pollAn opinion poll is a research survey (usually carried out on a representative sample of the electorate) to gauge likely results in an election.Poll‘The polls’ refers to the places where people vote in an election: exit polls and opinion polls refer to two kinds of survey used to predict election results.Postal voteAn absentee vote where the vote is sent in by post.At the 2019 general election, 17.2% of voters across the UK used a postal ballot.Proxy voteA vote where a person who can’t make it to the booth appoints someone to vote for them.In the 2019 election, 0.6% of voters appointed a proxy.PsephologyPsephology is the scientific study of elections and voting and is used to predict and analyse election results.Polling dayThe day when the country places their vote: in the UK 2024 election, this is July 4.PurdahBefore British elections, the country enters purdah, officially known as the ‘pre-election period of sensitivity’.Purdah means that politicians (both local and national) and other people such as civil servants face restrictions on what they can do and announce.Ministers who remain in office can’t announce new funding, or new policies, or anything which might sway voters or make the government more popular.The idea is that public money cannot be spent on the election.Spoiled ballotA ballot paper which has been marked wrongly (for instance with a vote for more than one candidate) will not be counted.Sometimes people spoil ballots deliberately as a protest vote to show dissatisfactionSwing‘Swing’ is the change in voter support for a political party between one election and the next.It is used to analyse the performance of parties in different areas.Tax burdenThe tax burden refers to the total amount of taxes paid by a group (in this case the UK as a whole) as a proportion of total income.The tax burden is currently at its highest in 70 years according to the OECD.The Equality ActThe 2010 Equality Act protects people against discrimination in Britain.The Conservatives want to ‘tweak’ the Act so that sex-based protections only apply on the basis of someone’s biological sex.Triple lockThe triple lock is a guarantee introduced to the state pension in 2010 so it would not lose value in real terms.The guarantee means that the state pension will rise by the highest out of average earnings, inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) or 2.5%.Triple lock plusThe ‘triple lock plus’ is a Conservative policy, which would see the tax-free pension allowance rise every year in line with the triple lock of average wages, inflation, or 2.5% – whichever is highest, to prevent pensioners being pulled into paying income tax.TurnoutTurnout refers to the percentage of people eligible to vote who turn out to vote on election day.In the 2019 election, for example, 67.3% of those eligible turned out to vote.VATValue added tax is added to goods and services sold by VAT-registered companies, and is the third-largest source of government income after income tax and national insurance.Both Labour and the Conservatives have pledged not to raise VAT.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

The Guardian,Surprise election forces comedians to tear up Edinburgh festival scripts,[],Rachael Healy,22 June 2024 at 9:00 am·4-min read,22,June,2024,09:00:00,4,"“Let’s just say, I didn’t make a bet on the election date, and if I had, I would be massively out of pocket,” says Emma Sidi, who’ll be performing in character as chief Partygate investigator Sue Gray in her new show at this year’s Edinburgh festival fringe. It’s a surreal take on political comedy, with character comedian Sidi reimagining Gray as “a real hun, that kind of girl next door, someone who says it how it is”, but there are also topical jokes, with Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer appearing as key characters.Sidi, like most of the country, expected the election would be called in autumn, so when the announcement came that it would be done and dusted less than a month before the fringe opens, comedians who dared to tackle politics in this volatile year were suddenly faced with serious rewrites.Nish Kumar is no stranger to the demands of political comedy and always planned to experiment with the work in progress run of his new show in Edinburgh, before touring this autumn, so was braced for change. But maybe not this soon.“I was working under the assumption that I would be rewriting for an election that would be called in October,” he says.“But what we all didn’t take into account is that Rishi Sunak has absolutely no idea how politics works.”Podcaster and satirist Matt Forde’s new show anticipates the end of a political era: “But I didn’t realise that era was going to end before the festival starts,” he says. “The challenge is not knowing the result yet. I’m writing about stuff that’s happening in the election but once we’re on the other side, it will feel quite dated. It’s going to give me three weeks to write a show and that’s a big pressure.”Both Sidi and Kumar feel Liz Truss jokes will be the first to go. “By the time I go on tour, she’ll be two prime ministers ago,” Kumar says.Truss featured heavily in an earlier version of Sidi’s show, imagined as a crisp-loving former friend of the senior civil servant. Audiences loved it for weeks, “then it just stopped working, we started to forget about her,” Sidi says.Yet jokes about older events can work. Gray’s own moment in the spotlight was many months ago, but Sidi found intrigue in “this shadowy character who everyone in the UK has heard of but nobody knows anything about”, especially as her path from investigating the Conservative government’s misdeeds to becoming Starmer’s chief of staff could prove to be “a blinder” if her new boss becomes prime minister.Sidi is interested in “our obsession with charisma, and thinking that it’s relevant to policy”, and is more concerned with “tapping into national feeling more than tapping into the facts of politics”, making much of her material more durable.While Kumar plans to create new jokes “week on week”, with one section of the show dedicated to topical material, he’s also determined to give the long view on the Conservative government. “I hope we don’t forget that the failure is not confined to the past two years,” he says. “Stuff about Truss might feel like old hat, but I hope I can find a way to talk about this era, 14 years of uninterrupted failure and stagnation.”For Forde, who’s been taking political comedy to the fringe since 2010, the trick is to dig into the character of politicians.“A broader piece about a party or individual can last longer,” he says. And with impressions part of his comedy arsenal, mastering impersonations of a politician like Starmer could yield years of material.Related: ‘People think I’m a real MP’: satirist Rosie Holt on life as a fake viral politicianThere are also ways to reframe topical jokes: “Stuff at the moment about why the Tory campaign isn’t going well, on the other side of the election if the Tories have lost, can be a postmortem.”Despite the challenges, all three feel the election announcement has added excitement to this year’s fringe. Forde “squealed with delight” when the news broke. “Change is good for creativity, it generates interest and material,” he says. “The enemy of comedy is when things feel mundane.”A change of government would be a double win for Sidi, the perfect ending to Sue Gray’s journey, and a personal relief. “We need a new government for the sake of my show! And arguably for the sake of the country,” she laughs.Kumar reflects on the strange position his work places him in – railing against rightwing politicians has brought him professional success (“it bought me a house!”) but he’s ready for change: “If someone gave me a choice of giving up my career or this country being run competently, I’ll do a law conversion.”"
Sky News,Keir Starmer attends Taylor Swift concert - and fans are quick to make puns,[],Sky News,22 June 2024 at 4:13 am·3-min read,22,June,2024,04:13:00,3,"Sir Keir Starmer said Taylor Swift was ""absolutely fantastic"" after attending her Friday night concert at Wembley Stadium.The Labour leader took a break from the campaign trail to attend the first night of the London leg of the American pop star's record-breaking Eras tour.Election latest: Farage criticised for 'disgraceful' comments on Ukraine warHowever he couldn't resist mixing pop with politics when asked what his favourite song of hers is.He told reporters on Saturday: ""I know I will be asked what is my favourite song and I am not going to pretend I have got every album and know every song, although Change is the one for obvious reasons.""The Labour manifesto, entitled Change, shares its name with a song from Swift's 2008 album Fearless.Sir Keir added: ""What I learned last night is my daughter knows every album, every song, and every word of every song, and she wasn't alone among the teenage girls who were there.""It was utterly brilliant.""Swift is performing three gigs in the capital this weekend - before returning to the venue in August for a further five.Last night Sir Keir posted a picture alongside his wife Victoria on X with the caption: ""Swift campaign pitstop.""Referring to some of Swift's song titles, fans joined in on the puns including: ""Change (Keir's Version)"" and ""I Can Fix The Country (No Really I Can)"".Others quipped that the PM hopeful was ""about to 'shake off' 14 years of Tory chaos"" and that it had been a ""Cruel Summer"" for his political opponent Rishi Sunak.Sir Keir, currently 20-points ahead in the polls, has previously spoken about his love for music, naming Northern soul among his favourite genres, though he recently told The Financial Times that rapper Stormzy's last album is ""my favourite album at the moment"".The Labour leader joins the prime minister in revealing an enjoyment of the singer's music.Rishi Sunak is known to have attended a Swift gig during a visit to California last summer.But the Tory leader has said on the campaign trail he does not meet the threshold to be considered a ""Swiftie"" in the eyes of his two daughters.Sir Keir was not the only famous face in attendance at Swift's concert.The singer was supported by her NFL boyfriend Travis Kelce, while Bridgerton star Nicola Coughlan and model Cara Delevingne were also among the star-studded crowd.Prince William was also seen dancing to ""Shake it Off"" to celebrate his 42nd birthday, this afternoon shared a photo of the pop superstar taking a selfie with him and his children George and Charlotte.Read more:In pictures: Taylor Swift's opening Wembley showSwift will return to the 90,000-capacity venue on Saturday evening and Sunday before moving on to mainland Europe, coming back to Wembley for another five dates in August.Londoners have waited more than a year for the show to arrive after she kicked off her marathon string of dates in Glendale, Arizona, in March 2023.She played three sold-out shows at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh earlier this month, followed by three at Anfield Stadium in Liverpool and one night at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff.Taylor-mania has taken hold of London in recent days, with the city's iconic Tube map redrawn to celebrate her arrival.Swift-fever even spread to Buckingham Palace earlier on Friday where Shake It Off was played at the traditional Changing of the Guard ceremony.It was revealed on Thursday that Swift's fans were expected to boost the London economy by £300m as the capital hosts more Eras Tour shows than any other city in the world, with nearly 640,000 people expected to attend across the eight dates."
The Telegraph,Why lawyerly Keir Starmer may struggle to bring the City’s swagger back,"['Cutting red tape ... while dreaming up more', 'Civil service enablers']",Szu Ping Chan,22 June 2024 at 2:00 am·9-min read,22,June,2024,02:00:00,9,"Giant Keir Starmer moving through the CityBattered by the financial crisis and pandemic, Britain has lost its culture of risk-taking. In the fourth and final part of a special election series, The Telegraph examines how this has affected the economy and whether Labour can bring swashbuckling back to the City.Not long ago, Sir Keir Starmer campaigned on a manifesto that had little good to say about big business.“The big polluters, financial speculators and corporate tax-dodgers have had a free ride for too long,” Labour’s 2019 manifesto read.While small companies may have cheered this sentiment, anyone too large stood to be hammered.“The upper echelons of corporate Britain have been corrupted by a culture in which the long-term health of a company is sacrificed for a quick buck for a few,” the party thundered under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership.ADVERTISEMENTSir Keir has sought to distance himself from that language and reassure the City he can be trusted.It has proven tricky. Put on the spot in TV debates, the leader of the opposition awkwardly said that Mr Corbyn would have been a better prime minister than Boris Johnson.Labour’s manifesto this time around is a lot warmer towards the City of London.“Financial services are one of Britain’s greatest success stories,” Labour now claims.It is part of a campaign to show the party is no longer hostile to the wealth-generating, tax-paying industries on which workers, the wider economy and public finances all rely.Shadow ministers have hosted breakfast meetings with bosses. Labour has appointed financial luminaries such as Mark Carney to work out how to harness the City of London’s firepower to the party’s ends. And both shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves and Sir Keir have sought to channel the spirit of New Labour when it comes to wealth creation.Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves and shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds, right, have been central to the party's pro-business rebrand - Lucy North/PA WireExecutives appreciate the effort – they are grateful to have at least some familiarity with the key players in the likely next government.But the key question is whether a friendlier atmosphere will turn into the kind of policy changes that could unleash investment and risk-taking, which in turn power the economic growth Labour so sorely wants and needs.Story continues“In private conversations I get the impression regulators think they’re going to get an easier ride under Labour,” says one leading voice in the City.“I think they are both right and wrong. Labour does have it hard-wired into their DNA to focus on consumer and retail issues. So I think they will back the regulators on that.“But where I think the regulators are mistaken is if they think that Labour will go easier on them on competitiveness and economic growth. Because I think Labour will come in and will drive as hard as it can for growth.”But is the lawyerly Sir Keir really the leader Britain needs to bring back swashbuckling in the City?Reviving risk taking would certainly be popular in the Square Mile. Much as the Conservatives trade on their historic position as the party of business, the executive class have had plenty to complain about after the last 14 years, first under the Coalition then the Tories alone.What began with a “red tape challenge” to slash the regulatory burden has become something quite different.The Tories have in fact overseen a blizzard of new rules: from bank capital requirements to unnecessary form filling and a proliferation of quangos and quasi-governmental bodies.Painful new taxes came in under the Conservatives. The bank levy rakes in around £1.5bn per year for the Exchequer. The bank surcharge, introduced to stop lenders benefitting from cuts to corporation tax, brought in £2.5bn in 2022-23, though that haul is falling now that corporation tax has been whacked back up again.Matthew Lesh at the Institute of Economic Affairs says this all pushes up the cost of capital in the City, which hits the real economy.“The result you are going to have is less economic growth, lower productivity, lower wages and higher prices,” he says.Labour promises in its manifesto to “create the conditions to support innovation and growth in the sector, through supporting new technology, including Open Banking and Open Finance and ensuring a pro-innovation regulatory framework”.It certainly sounds optimistic. Yet cutting red tape has not been the party’s natural preference historically, so the question is whether or not warm words will be matched with action.Many believe Labour does want to stir things up but will struggle.The Telegraph has spoken to a dozen people who have met party officials over the past couple of years, as well as other leading City voices. They collectively believe that those who are hoping for a sea change under Labour are likely to be disappointed.Lord O’Neill, who has served as a Treasury minister and advised Labour on its start-ups strategy, warns that the government cannot legislate for growth.“Anything that tries to force investors to artificially do something that the fundamentals don’t support could create a new performance problem,” he says.Labour is “very definitely” listening, adds Lord O’Neill, even though the party may not have the financial firepower to match some of its bold ideas.Cutting red tape ... while dreaming up moreOne of Labour’s ideas is to give the British Business Bank a bigger role in investment and open access to government contracts to small and medium-sized businesses.It has also promised to speed up planning for gigafactories, digital infrastructure and laboratories – examples of the real world assets which the City wants to finance, if only the rules would let businesses get building.Yet there are also big promises for more regulation, including on ESG, the environmental, social and governance campaigns beloved of political activists.“Labour will make the UK the green finance capital of the world, mandating UK-regulated financial institutions – including banks, asset managers, pension funds, and insurers – and FTSE 100 companies to develop and implement credible transition plans that align with the 1.5C goal of the Paris Agreement,” the party says.Lesh warns: “This is another huge regulatory cost on institutions.”Other industries face more red tape too, with a pledge for “much tougher regulation” of energy.A policy to “work with the private sector, including banks and building societies, to provide further private finance to accelerate home upgrades and low carbon heating” sounds like a new plan to tell banks what to do.The party also wants to create a new Regulatory Innovation Office, which will “help regulators update regulation, speed up approval timelines, and co-ordinate issues that span existing boundaries,” the party has pledged.While this may help to streamline rules, a department called “Regulatory Innovation” may well find itself dreaming up new red tape.Lesh adds: “Regulators themselves are constantly pumping out codes of conduct and guidance and consultations. It is really very heavy handed.”Civil service enablersSome warn that the UK’s safety-first culture is embedded at the heart of Whitehall. It means that Labour’s traditional instincts to regulate could be enabled by civil servants keen to draw up new rules.“The civil service is designed to eliminate the risk of the Government having a mishap that ends up in the press,” says the leader of one private sector company who works with civil servants each week. “And that is a fundamental problem. The majority want to make the country better, but we’ve slipped into a system where everybody just worries about ministers putting their foot in it.”James Palmer, a senior partner at Herbert Smith Freehills, suggests a big Labour majority may at least usher in more stability, which would be beneficial for the City. He says: “The ministerial churn we have had in recent years has been a disaster for long term thinking.”Anne Glover, chief executive at Amadeus Capital Partners, a venture capital business that has invested in close to 200 companies, believes Labour is listening.Glover, who was one of 10 City advisers on the party’s review of the Square Mile, says: “[There is an] intellectual understanding of the importance of entrepreneurship from growth, absolutely.”However, Glover is more disappointed with the party’s desire to close what it has branded a “carried interest tax loophole”.Amadeus Capital Partners boss Anne Glover has high hopes for Labour's growth plans but warns against some of the party's proposed taxes - REUTERS/Suzanne PlunkettUnder current rules, instead of receiving a salary or bonus, private equity executives and venture capital investors can take a stake in the funds they manage. This allows private equity fund managers to pay only 28pc tax on their income because any profits are treated as capital gains instead of income.Labour claims this is a loophole and wants to bring the taxation into line with income tax.Glover says the reward reflects the risk these managers take over an extended period of time.Labour believes it will raise more than £500m extra per year by the end of the decade from around 2,000 people who benefit from current legislation.But Glover warns the policy is likely to cost the Exchequer by deterring investment, leaving no money to pay for the mental health staff the money was supposed to fund.“I would predict they would lose as much in lost activity because the private equity guys can move. They function globally, they’ll just go live somewhere else.”Glover herself says the policy would damage her business in a different way. As her focus is on UK start-ups, she wouldn’t be able to move jurisdiction. However, the crackdown would lead the venture capitalists of the future to make their money doing something else, she warns. That would mean less funding for innovative businesses.“It’s a long-term consequence, not a short-term one. You’ll just attract less talent into the business,” she says.Labour needs to do more to show it really wants to let financial services boost growth.Yet when asked to put forward a shadow cabinet minister to explain why Sir Keir, a leader with a background in the law and the public sector rather than business, is the right candidate to free the City to grow again, the party declined."

Whether he's lying or not, it doesn't matter to him.""Sir Keir then laid out the specific way he ""set a trap"" for Mr Johnson to catch him out over the Downing Street parties scandal, according to The Guardian.He said: ""When I first asked him, 'Did you apply all the rules?' I hadn't seen the video of Allegra [Stratton, then director of strategic communications].""But he was told about her laughing in response to being asked, 'What do we say about the parties?' So I said [to my team], 'I think there's something here. Let's get him on record. Because his instinct will be to lie.'The former director of public prosecutions added: ""It was a thread that we pulled over months. I was less bothered by what he was saying to me than trying to be forensic and getting him on the record. It paid dividends in the end. He had to leave parliament - because he'd lied.""Ms Stratton resigned in December 2021 over a video which showed her laughing about a Downing Street Christmas party, which happened when London was under strict COVID restrictions.Mr Johnson lasted seven more months, narrowly surviving a no-confidence motion triggered by outrage within his party at reports of repeated rule-breaking in Downing Street.Mr Johnson, his wife Carrie and then chancellor Rishi Sunak were among 83 people fined over lockdown-breaching events in Downing Street during the pandemic, when the nation lived under strict social distancing restrictions.The scandal meant Mr Johnson was on thin ice by the time the Chris Pincher affair emerged - sparking a wave of mass resignations which ultimately brought him down.Mr Johnson was later found to have ""deliberately"" misled MPs over the partygate scandal by a Commons inquiry - a ruling which led to him quitting parliament altogether, claiming he was the victim of a ""witch-hunt"".The former Tory leader has always denied misleading colleagues over the parties, insisting that when he claimed ""all rules had been followed"", that is what he believed to be true at the time."

Some three-quarters of the Cabinet would lose their seats in that scenario – including Sunak.Were Sunak to lose his seat in Richmond (Yorks), it would make him the first prime minister in history to lose their seat in a general election, according to the Institute for Government. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is also facing a battle to hold on to his constituency, with the vote on a “knife edge”.Savanta spoke to around 18,000 people between 7 June and 18 June for their poll. If reflected in the election, Labour would be on course to win 516 seats, with a commanding Commons majority of 382. The Liberal Democrats would have nearly as many seats (50) as the Tories.Jeremy Hunt: My constituency is on a knife edgeHunt could be among the Conservative casualties on the night of the 4 July poll, despite his newly-created seat in Godalming and Ash currently holding a Conservative majority of more than 10,000. He is facing a battle to win the seat in Surrey, with the Liberal Democrats keen on taking a high-profile scalp.Several other Tory ‘big beasts’ also face a tight vote to hold onto their seat, according to a major poll by Ipsos.Grant ShappsDefence secretary Grant Shapps may lose his seat in the election. (Getty)Defence secretary Grant Shapps, who had been touted as a potential leader of the Conservatives after the election, is at risk of losing his Welwyn Hatfield seat, according to Ipsos. Their polling suggests a likely Labour victory, with Sir Keir Starmer’s party currently on 48%, compared to 28% for the Conservatives.Shapps won the seat in the 2019 election with a vote share of 52.6%, increasing his majority from the previous election.Penny MordauntPenny Mordaunt’s seat is at risk from Labour. (PA)Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons, is another Tory MP whose name has been mentioned in a future leadership contest – in the event of the Tories losing the election. However, she may not even be an MP after 4 July as her Portsmouth North seat is at risk.Seen as “leaning Labour”, polling suggests Labour are on 42%, compared to the Tories on 34%. She won 61.4% of the vote in the 2019 election.Liz TrussFormer prime minister Liz Truss may not be an MP after the election. (PA)Former prime minister Liz Truss is at risk in her South West Norfolk seat. The seat is seen as a “toss up”, with Truss currently in the lead at 31%. Labour are a sitting at 27% but Reform UK are polling 30%.Allowing for margins of error and another two weeks of campaigning, the seat will be hotly contested between all three parties on 4 July.Jacob Rees-MoggJacob Rees-Mogg is on track to lose his seat at the general election. (PA)While no longer a government minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg losing his North East Somerset and Hanham seat would perhaps be one of the night’s bigger surprises. Rees-Mogg has been an outspoken critic of some of Sunak’s policies and is a regular presenter on GB News.However, the Ipsos poll has the seat, which has been newly-created for the 2024 election, is currently showing a “likely Labour” win, with the party on 47%, compared to 30% for the Conservatives.Johnny MercerPolling suggests Johnny Mercer will lose his seat to Labour at the election. (PA)Veterans’ affairs secretary Johnny Mercer is standing for the Plymouth Moor View seat, having last won the seat in 2019 with an increased vote share of 60.7%. However, a “likely” Labour win is expected, with a projected vote share of 49% on 4 July. The Tories are currently polling at 30% – half of what they won in 2019.Victoria PrentisAttorney general Victoria Prentis is currently facing being replaced by Labour in the election. (PA)A “likely” Labour victory is predicted for Banbury, a seat currently held by attorney general Victoria Prentis. The Tories are polling at 30% in the constituency, compared to 40% for Labour. Prentis is notable for being the first British MP to take a Ukrainian refugee in her house following Russia’s invasion.Alex ChalkThe Libreal Democrats are projected to take over justice secretary Alex Chalk’s seat. (Alamy)Justice secretary Alex Chalk won 48% of the vote in the Cheltenham constituency in the 2019 election. However, the seat is now leaning to being “strong Liberal Democrat”, with Sir Ed Davey’s party polling 60% of the vote.

Evening Standard,Nigel Farage criticised for suggesting the West provoked Putin's invasion of Ukraine,[],Sami Quadri,22 June 2024 at 1:40 am·4-min read,22,June,2024,01:40:00,4,"Nigel Farage has faced a backlash for suggesting the West provoked Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.The Reform UK leader said Mr Putin was wrong to order the invasion but maintained that the expansion of the European Union gave him the ""excuse"" he needed.Home Secretary James Cleverly condemned Mr Farage for “echoing Putin’s vile justification for the brutal invasion of Ukraine” after drawing a link between Nato expansion in recent decades and the conflict in eastern Europe.Appearing on the Panorama Interviews on BBC One on Friday, Mr Farage faced questions about his opinion of Russian president Vladimir Putin.He replied: “I said I disliked him as a person, but I admired him as a political operator because he’s managed to take control of running Russia.”These are disgraceful comments, which reveal the true face of Nigel Farage: a Putin apologist who should never be trusted with our nation's securityJohn Healy, LabourMr Putin has served continuously as either Russian president or prime minister since 1999, with elections which have been described as “rigged”.Mr Farage, a former member of the European Parliament, added: “Right, I’ll tell you what you don’t know, I stood up in the European Parliament in 2014 and I said, and I quote, ‘there will be a war in Ukraine’.“Why did I say that? It was obvious to me that the ever-eastward expansion of Nato and the European Union was giving this man a reason to his Russian people to say, ‘they’re coming for us again’ and to go to war.”Mr Farage went on to say he had been making similar comments “since the 1990s, ever since the fall of the (Berlin) Wall” and added: “Hang on a second, we provoked this war.“It’s, you know, of course it’s his fault – he’s used what we’ve done as an excuse.”Mr Farage has drawn criticism from senior politicians, including Mr Cleverly who wrote on X, formerly Twitter: “Just Farage echoing Putin’s vile justification for the brutal invasion of Ukraine.”Labour shadow defence secretary John Healy said Mr Farage would “rather lick Vladimir Putin’s boots than stand up for the people of Ukraine” and added: “These are disgraceful comments, which reveal the true face of Nigel Farage: a Putin apologist who should never be trusted with our nation’s security.“Up until now, there has been a united front amongst Britain’s political leaders in supporting the people of Ukraine against the unprovoked and unjustifiable assault they have suffered at the hands of Vladimir Putin.”Former defence minister Tobias Ellwood told the Daily Telegraph: “Churchill will be turning in his grave.“Putin, already enjoying how Farage is disrupting British politics, will be delighted to hear this talk of appeasement during our election debate.”A row has also broken out in Plymouth Moor View, where Conservative candidate and veterans minister Johnny Mercer accused his Labour rival, Fred Thomas, of “bloating” his military service.Mr Mercer accused his opponent Mr Thomas of lying about his service.The veterans minister outlined his concerns on the social media website X, writing: “Nobody who serves in Special Forces Support Group claims they are Special Forces.“Anyone who has served can say if they were or were not actually in combat – the ‘can’t discuss’ line has been used by Walter Mittys since time began.“Not a single person has put their hand up today and said they fought alongside Fred. Must have been one of those one-man missions that happen all the time.“He himself boasted of serving in combat missions. It is strange that he now cannot talk about it.”A Labour spokesperson told the PA news agency that Mr Thomas is a “decorated ex-Royal Marine” who “served for seven years, rising to the rank of captain”.They added: “Due to the highly sensitive and recent nature of his role, Thomas remains unable to discuss much of his service.“His Certificate of Valediction notes that Thomas gained ‘considerable operational experience relative to the time you have served’.“It notes Thomas’ ‘command on operations overseas’ which saw him ‘lead personnel … in a range of hostile and challenging environments’.”Mr Thomas said: “I am proud of having served my country for seven years, including overseas on operations. I remain unable to discuss much of my service, something which Johnny Mercer – as a former defence minister – is keenly aware of.”"

The polls have consistently painted a very bleak picture for the prime minister, with Labour holding on to a double-digit poll lead over his Conservatives.Recent by-election results suggest that Labour is likely to win a landslide victory – but there’s still time for the PM to turn it around.Here’s everything you need to know about Sunak and what’s he’s saying about the biggest issues in British politics right now.Early lifeSunak was born in Southampton in 1980, the eldest of three children. His Indian parents both arrived from East Africa in the 1960s. A football-mad boy whose childhood idol was Matt Le Tissier, Sunak was described by the family’s neighbours as a child with “lovely manners”.In his youngest years, the PM attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. According to a recent biography, fellow pupil Ollie Case said: “He was someone that was talked about. The teachers would say: ‘He’s going to be prime minister'.""But, growing up in the 1980s and 90s, he also remembers experiencing racism. “My mother was obsessed with us not having accents,” Sunak has said.Rishi Sunak was football-mad as a boy growing up in Southampton. (ITV)Sunak's familySunak is married to Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian entrepreneur and multi-billionaire. The pair first met in 2004 at Stanford University, his future wife apparently attracted to his “honesty and integrity”.Five years later they married in a two-day Indian wedding held in Bangalore. The couple have two daughters, Krishna and Anoushka, who will turn 13 and 11 this year, both of whom are largely kept out of the public eye.Sunak attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. (Rishi Sunak, Instagram)His parentsYashvir Sunak, Rishi’s father, was born in Kenya. He arrived in the UK to study medicine and then stayed, becoming an NHS GP. His mother, Usha, was born in Tanzania and is a pharmacist.The couple met in Britain and settled in Southampton in the 1970s. Usha is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.His educationAs a teenager Sunak studied at Winchester College where he was, he says, a self-confessed “geek”. According to a recent biography, the “naughtiest” thing the prime minister did during his school days “was to smuggle a hand-held television into the school so that he did not miss any key games of Euro 96”.The childhood home of Rishi Sunak in Southampton. (Getty Images, photo taken in 2022)Perhaps unsurprisingly for someone with such an unblemished record, he went on to become the school’s head boy. Sunak worked while studying, delivering medicines for his mother’s pharmacy and as a waiter at a local Indian restaurant.After school, Sunk read philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, graduating in 2001 with a first class degree. While still at university he held an internship at the Conservative Party campaign headquarters and joined the party, but went on studying before entering politics.He earned his MBA from Stanford in 2006 as a Fulbright Scholar, meaning he was selected among the most promising candidates from the UK.How much is he worth?As prime minister, Rishi Sunak earns £80,807 on top of a salary of £84,144 for being an MP. But his current income from Westminster pales in comparison to his family’s vast wealth through marriage.The Sunday Times valued the couple’s joint fortune at £730m. Murty's father is the co-founder of Infosys, an Indian tech conglomerate, in which she holds shares estimated at around £430m. Her family is also involved in a £900m business arrangement with Amazon in India, and she is a shareholder of multiple other companies.Rishi Sunak's mother is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.Before entering politics Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and a series of hedge funds. He is also known to have invested in blind trusts, in which investments are made without holders knowing where the funds are located. These arrangements reportedly hold Sunak’s own multi-million-pound fortune.His religionSunak is not only the first prime minister of colour and of Indian heritage but he is also the first practising Hindu to hold the biggest job in UK politics.He has spoken of his pride in his Hindu faith, saying, “that’s how I was raised, and that’s how I am”. He said: “Having faith gives you resilience, gives you strength that is important and it provides an outlook on life which I find particularly valuable.”Sunak on... the NHSThe prime minister’s biggest challenge in office has been the crisis in the NHS - and to many people in the sector his government has been found wanting. “We have not made enough progress,” Sunak said when asked about his commitment to cut NHS waiting lists during an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV. Asked if that meant he had failed, the prime minister replied: “Yes, we have.""Sunak expects to see waiting lists start to reduce this spring, and blames the delays on “industrial action”, as disputes with junior doctors and consultants over pay and conditions continue. Yet Sunak himself has been blamed for holding up a deal that would prevent more walkouts.Sunak, his wife Akshata and daughters Anoushka and Krishna (second left) at Santa Monica Pier, California, on their summer holiday in 2023. (AP)Sunak on… immigrationAccording to the prime minister, illegal migration threatens to “overwhelm” Europe. In June 2023 he claimed his plan to “stop the boats” and tackle illegal immigration was working, but by August 2023 he had changed his mind: “It’s not an easy problem to fix,” he told broadcasters. “I never said we would be able to solve it overnight.”He has staked much of his reputation on the government's Rwanda Bill - his plan to deport asylum seekers to the east African country that finally became law last month, after months of legal and procedural challenges. It has paved the way for deportation flights to get off the ground within weeks.He described his policy, which he says will act as a deterrent to people traffickers, as being “the will of the people” – yet polling suggests low support for such a punitive approach.The policy, coupled with Conservative talk of limits on legal migration, shows that the government is committed to taking a hard line on the issue, despite the risk of alienating more moderate voters.The Rwanda policy is not universally popular. (YouGov)Sunak on... the cost of living crisisThe prime minister has told hard-pressed working families that they will feel some relief from the cost of living crisis as inflation continues to drop following its highs of October 2022. He described the government’s tax cuts as “meaningful” and has welcomed the dip in mortgage rates at the turn of the year.Sunak says falling inflation will have the biggest impact on family budgets “and will start to ease some of those pressures” and that he was right to focus on that figure. However, the global drop in energy prices is probably the biggest factor in easing the hit on wallets - something that the prime minister has no control over.However, the fall in inflation to 2.3% on 22 May this year – the lowest it has been in nearly three years – was likely one of the key factors in persuading Sunak to call a snap election many weeks earlier than experts had predicted.Can we expect more handouts or tax breaks to help balance family budgets? Not according to Sunak, who has warned voters that it’s time to “move on” from government support.Sunak on... pensionsThe triple-lock pensions policy is a tricky one for Sunak – especially since Labour has committed to retaining the policy. Any change to a policy that has become a hallmark of recent Conservative governments would not go down well with the 12 million pensioners it would likely impact – many of whom are lifelong Tory voters.Last November, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said pensions should start being pegged to an average of inflation and wage growth, which would help reduce state spending over time.Sunak’s response to that was ambiguous to say the least: “We are the government that has … delivered the triple lock and it is why, right now, pensions are, depending on how you look at it, £800 or £900 bigger than they otherwise would have been.” He is yet to confirm whether it will appear in the manifesto."
Yahoo News UK,"Will Nigel Farage's Reform UK 'beat' the Tories in the election?With some polling figures putting the Tories and Reform UK nearly neck and neck, could Farage's party really end up with nearly as many MPs as Sunak's?","['What do the latest polls say?', 'Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?', 'Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?', 'What is proportional representation?']",James Cheng-Morris and  Ellen Manning,Updated 14 June 2024 at 5:33 am·7-min read,14,June,2024,05:33:00,7,"Leading pollster John Curtice has poured cold water on suggestions that Reform UK is now beating the Conservative Party in the general election polls.As representatives from seven parties took prepared to take part in a TV debate on Thursday, a YouGov survey for The Times newspaper said Reform’s support had increased by two points to 19%, putting them ahead of the Tories for the first time.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage took the the opportunity to hail the poll results in the debate, declaring: “We are now the opposition to Labour.”But Curtice urged caution, insisting that single polls should not be relied on. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""This is one poll - we’ve actually, I think, had four other polls published in the last 24 hours - none of which have had Reform ahead, not even all of which have had Reform gaining ground, but quite a couple of them certainly suggesting it’s also got very close.""He said it may not be the case that Reform are ahead - and could be on average four or five points behind. But he said: ""This is still bad news for the Conservatives. The only way Rishi Sunak can hope to get even to base camp in narrowing the lead that Labour have started off with this campaign was to squeeze the Reform vote.""He added: ""Rather than making progress, things are actually going backwards, not least of course because of Nigel Farage’s decision to fight this campaign.""With many speculating that Reform UK with Farage at the helm could ""beat"" the Tories, Yahoo News UK takes a look.What do the latest polls say?YouGov’s voting intention tracker, updated on Tuesday, suggests the Tories and Reform UK are neck and neck.With Labour well ahead on 38%, the Tories are trailing on 18% – compared to a high of 53% under Boris Johnson in 2020 – with Reform UK just behind on 17% and the Liberal Democrats on 15%.However, there are multiple polls taking place at any one time by a number of different companies.According to the PA news agency, an average of all polls that were carried out wholly or partly during the seven days to June 13 puts Labour on 43%, 21 points ahead of the Conservatives on 22%, followed by Reform on 14%, the Lib Dems on 10% and the Greens on 6%.And while Reform’s average is up one percentage point on the figure for the previous week and the Tories are down one point, there is still an eight-point gap, on average, between the two.Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?Unless something remarkable happens, in short: 'No' - and that's because of the first past the post (FPTP) voting system in which the candidate with the largest number of votes in their constituency is elected.According to the Electoral Reform Society, which is against FPTP, this system leads to a situation where “even if millions of voters support the same party, if they are thinly spread out across the UK they may only get the largest number of votes in a couple of these contests – so only win a few MPs"".“Tens of thousands of voters supporting a different party, but who live near each other, could end up with more MPs. This means the number of MPs a party has in parliament rarely matches their popularity with the public.”Rishi Sunak on the campaign trail on Wednesday. (AFP via Getty Images)Farage knows this well. As the leader of UKIP in the 2015 election, he saw his party win 12.6% of the nationwide vote and one seat. The Liberal Democrats won 7.9% of the vote... and eight seats.Indeed, YouGov last week released a poll – put together using the multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) surveying technique, from a sample size of nearly 60,000 respondents – which suggested the Tories would win just 140 seats, having won 365 in 2019. But this is still 140 more than the zero it projected Reform UK to win, in spite of its strong polling figures.The model had Reform UK ""performing strongly in a number of seats but still a long way off winning in any"", with projected second-placed finishes in 27 constituencies.YouGov's MRP projection. (YouGov)Granted, this model was formed between 24 May and 1 June, before Farage's headline-grabbing intervention on Monday last week in which he announced he would be standing as an MP.But, even as Reform UK polls closer than ever to the Tories, it's difficult to imagine the party winning more than a handful of seats.Chris Hopkins, director at polling firm Savanta, told Yahoo News UK that in one respect, Reform UK is at an advantage compared to Ukip in 2015 because ""Ukip took votes from both Labour and the Conservatives, and we are not seeing that with Reform UK – they are all coming from the Conservatives.""That is the consequence of Rishi Sunak making immigration a centrepiece of the campaign and failing to deliver on it. Even if you have voters that are neutral on immigration, they would say the small boats policy has been a disaster.""But even so, Hopkins said, Reform UK is still ""at a huge electoral disadvantage"" in that its votes are not very concentrated, they are very evenly spread.""There are going to be some races where Reform UK is strong - the Nigel Farage factor in Clacton is really interesting - but realistically its ceiling is five seats: and that’s a high ceiling.""Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey on a campaign visit in Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire, on Wednesday. (PA)Like Reform UK, Sir Ed Davey’s Liberal Democrats are performing well in the polls.In a sign of how defensive the Tory campaign is becoming, one online party advert claims voting for Reform UK or the Lib Dems could give Labour 100 extra seats, resulting in the biggest majority in its history.It depicts a scenario where the Conservatives are beaten into third place behind the Lib Dems, with just 57 seats, despite getting 19% of the vote and without Reform winning a single seat.Read more: Pollsters got it wrong in 2015, so could Labour’s lead be overestimated? (The Guardian)However, it remains unlikely the Lib Dems will finish second. YouGov’s MRP poll projected the party performing strongly, winning 48 seats. This would be up 37 from 2019, but still nowhere near the Tories’ projected 140.However, amid all this talk about projections, it’s worth remembering they are still only polls and not a definite indicator of how people will vote on 4 July. The 1992 and 2015 elections are notable examples of how polling didn’t match the end results of Tory wins.What is proportional representation?Proportional representation, as defined by the UK parliament, is an electoral system ""in which the distribution of seats corresponds closely with the proportion of the total votes cast for each party. For example, if a party gained 40% of the total votes, a perfectly proportional system would allow them to gain 40% of the seats.""This differs from the first past the post system, as set out above, in that a relatively high vote share rarely corresponds with increased seats for the smaller parties. In 2019, for example, the Lib Dems won 11.5% of the vote but only 1.7% – 11 – of the 650 seats.Unsurprisingly, both Reform UK and the Lib Dems support proportional representation.The Lib Dems this week made it part of their manifesto, with the party saying it would introduce the single transferrable vote method, a form of proportional representation which allows electors to rank their preference of candidates on the ballot.The party previously sought to change the UK’s voting system while in the coalition government under then-leader Nick Clegg, but voters rejected the plan in a 2011 referendum.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

The scale of Sunak's problems is demonstrated by the interactive maps below, showing just how much ground the Tories are expected to lose compared to their 2019 victory.Click on the arrows in the top left to switch between the two maps. Check your own constituency to see if it is projected to change handsThe first map above shows the seats won in the 2019 general election, when Boris Johnson led the party to a stunning majority.The wall of Tory blue on the map, compared to the spots of Labour red, is a demonstration of just how far Labour, then led by Jeremy Corbyn, had fallen in public standing. The result was Labour's worst electoral performance since 1935.If you toggle to the second map, the projection by YouGov (which was based on polling carried out between 24 May - 1 June) suggests that Starmer's party is on track to win 422 seats, with the Tories down to just 140.Such a result would be the Conservative Party's worst performance at a general election since 1906. If YouGov's predictions are accurate, Labour winning a 194-seat majority would be the highest number since Conservative Stanley Baldwin won a majority of 208 in 1924.The model suggests the Conservatives could be set for near wipeout across many areas of the country, including London, the North East, the North West, and Wales.It also projects that the Scottish National Party would lose more than half their seats, with Labour returning as the largest party north of the border, and the Liberal Democrats reclaiming its place as the third party of British politics – winning 48 seats.The new figures, released yesterday, came as Reform UK co-founder Nigel Farage announced that he would be returning as the populist party's leader and would stand for election in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. Even before Farage's latest bid, pollsters told Yahoo News that Reform UK could pose a serious threat to the Tories by splitting the vote and potentially handing even more seats to Labour.The YouGov projection follows a similar poll by modelling site Electoral Calculus, which came out on 31 May. The polling also compares the 2019 result with Electoral Calculus' projection.It predicts that Labour is on course to win an even bigger majority of 319 seats - with Starmer's party picking up 485 MPs and the Tories way behind with 66. The modelling shows the Lib Dems getting very close to the Conservative Party, with 59 seats.While Electoral Calculus' polling, based on opinion polls from 8 May to 20 May, returns a different set of projections to YouGov's, both clearly indicate the scale of the problem facing Sunak.The Electoral Calculus model has predicted Sir Keir Starmer's Labour will win a massive majority.

The Telegraph,Roger Waters lambastes Keir Starmer in pro-Palestine fundraiser concert,[],Alexander Larman,22 June 2024 at 7:23 am·2-min read,22,June,2024,07:23:00,2,"There is something galling about being told by Roger Waters, halfway through an interminable rant about Palestine, Keir Starmer and how awful politicians are generally, that I look bored. Fair play to Waters, who, famously, once spat in an unappreciative fan’s face, an action that inspired his magnum opus The Wall: he doesn’t mince his words. He was the headline act for a hastily organised show at St Pancras Church that was half awareness-raiser for Palestine and half rally for Andrew Feinstein, the independent candidate for Starmer’s constituency of Holborn and St Pancras.It was, inevitably, something of a scrappy evening, even after entering the venue past the angry pro-Israel protesters, booming out I Will Survive from their speakers. A trio of acts performed to a highly partisan audience that included an appropriately stern-faced Alexei Sayle. In between the deafening chants of “Free Palestine!” and “Long live Palestine”, there were some musical gems, as well as longueurs. First up was rapper Lowkey, who was accompanied by a bandmate on grand piano and whose angry, politicised raps played well to the crowd, especially his song ‘Dear England’, written in the aftermath of the Grenfell tragedy and now updated to include attacks on Starmer – “He calls himself a human rights lawyer but does not believe in genocide… he backs Israel to the hilt.”The big draws were Yusuf Islam, aka Cat Stevens, and Waters. Stevens performed a beautiful version of Wild World, as well as two less-distinguished contemporary songs, and struck the most emollient note, dedicating his act to the “most pure” children of Palestine and saying, “We’re fighting for peace, not for anything else.”Unfortunately, this didn’t get through to the headline act, who was on typically belligerent form. Black T-shirted and looking fit and active for an octogenarian, Waters and his bandmate Dave Kilminster treated the hushed congregation to an exquisite rendition of Wish You Were Here, but a long, rambling newer song, The Bar, sounded like an outtake from TheWall – a feeling reinforced when Waters concluded it with the opening verses of Outside the Wall.Rock’s most notorious provocateur, who professed himself jetlagged after only arriving in the country a couple of hours before, was on fighting form, vigorously denouncing “the genocide enabler” Starmer, and declaring “I’ve looked at Keir Starmer and I’ve looked at Andrew Feinstein.

Labour abandoned them.”She continued: “I’ve been a Labour voter, a member (no longer), donor (not recently) and campaigner (ditto) all my adult life. I want to see an end to this long stretch of chaotic and often calamitous Tory rule. I want to want to vote Labour.”The issue of transgender rights has long caused issues within the party.In 2021, Sir Keir described comments by MP Rosie Duffield that only women have a cervix as “something that shouldn’t be said and were not right”.In a televised debate on Thursday, the Labour leader agreed with one of his predecessors Sir Tony Blair, saying “biologically, a woman is with a vagina and a man is with a penis”.Last week, Ms Duffield said she had not attended election hustings while running in Canterbury due to “constant trolling” and has spent £2,000 on bodyguards while campaigning.“Rosie has received literally no support from Starmer over the threats and abuse, some of which has originated from within the Labour Party itself, and has had a severe, measurable impact on her life,” Ms Rowling wrote in The Times.“The impression given by Starmer at Thursday’s debate was that there had been something unkind, something toxic, something hard line, in Rosie’s words, even though almost identical words had sounded perfectly reasonable when spoken by Tony Blair.”She continued: “For left-leaning women like us, this isn’t, and never has been, about trans people enjoying the rights of every other citizen, and being free to present and identify however they wish.“This is about the right of women and girls to assert their boundaries. It’s about freedom of speech and observable truth.“It’s about waiting, with dwindling hope, for the left to wake up to the fact that its lazy embrace of a quasi-religious ideology is having calamitous consequences.”Earlier this month, an internet troll who posted online messages threatening to kill Ms Rowling and Ms Duffield was given suspended jail sentences.Glenn Mullen, 31, of Clyde Road, Manchester, admitted uploading audio clips in Gaelic threatening to kill Ms Rowling “with a big hammer” and said he was “going to see Rosie Duffield at the bar with a big gun”, Westminster Magistrates’ Court heard."
Yahoo News UK,"Who is Richard Tice? Reform’s former leader turned Farage sidekickThe candidate for Hartlepool has seen his party's popularity swell in recent months, with one poll showing reform ahead of the Conservatives.",[],Andrew Naughtie,Updated 14 June 2024 at 5:45 am·6-min read,14,June,2024,05:45:00,6,"Now that Nigel Farage has taken over as the leader of Reform UK, Richard Tice’s public profile is fading fast - but the Reform chairman remains involved in the party's operations.So far, the party has only one MP, Conservative defector Lee Anderson. But a recent poll has shown Reform overtaking the Tories, raising the possibility Anderson could hold his seat and even end up with fellow Reformers in the next Parliament.As the candidate for Hartlepool, where he stood as the Brexit Party candidate in 2019, Tice hopes to be one of them. So who is he, and what does he stand for?Childhood and educationBorn in Surrey in 1964 to James Tice, a showjumper, and Joan Tice, a horse trainer. Educated at the private boarding school Uppingham, he studied at the University of Salford, gaining a degree in construction economics and quantity surveying – teeing him up for a career that he said would ""continue the family genes in the property industry"".Family (partner & kids)Tice has three children from a 24-year marriage that ended in divorce. He is now in a long-term relationship with the right-wing writer and journalist Isabel Oakeshott.She is perhaps best known for two notorious incidents that set her against leading Tories: a book that featured the heavily disputed allegation that David Cameron had engaged in sexual activity with a pig, and the release of embarrassing messages entrusted to her by Matt Hancock when she agreed to write a book with him.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election? Full list mappedThe key issues that will decide the electionWhen is the first UK general election TV debate?What is purdah? The strict rule that governs what politicians can and can't sayNet worthWhile not quite in the same league as Rishi Sunak, Tice is one of the wealthiest people in British politics. As he describes it on his website, he made his multi-million-pound fortune over the course of “30 years of making things happen in property investment”, starting with a graduate job at a London firm in 1987.According to Tice, the company he leads as CEO, Quidnet Capital, has “bought and managed £500 million in commercial properties across the UK on behalf of clients”.He was also a key figure in the redevelopment of London’s Nine Elms district, near Battersea Power Station, a controversial project that has transformed a stretch of the Thames’s south bank with a welter of rapidly erected high-rise blocks.GB News linksAlong with Nigel Farage, Lee Anderson and several MPs on the right flank of the Tory party, Tice is a regular on the hard-right, culture war-focused TV outlet GB News. There he hosts a programme called “Richard Tice’s Sunday Sermon”, which serves as a platform for him to deliver his political analysis without the interruptions of an interviewer.However, despite the network being a relatively safe space for him in ideological terms, Tice’s appearances aren’t always amicable. A recent interview with host Andrew Pierce, a longtime right-wing commentator, saw him challenged fiercely about Reform’s chances in a summer election should one be called – with Pierce pointing to the “weirdos” selected by the party to fight numerous seats as evidence the party is “not ready”.Richard Tice, pictured in 2018 at a 'Leave Means Leave' campaign event, is focused on the issue of immigration. (Steve Finn/WENN)Tice was also involved in an incident that saw the network deemed in breach of broadcasting regulator Ofcom’s impartiality regulations, specifically an interview in which a former Brexit Party MEP failed to “sufficiently challenge” his views on immigration.The regulator is under increasing pressure to crack down on GB News heading into the election, with critics arguing it cannot be allowed to broadcast shows that feature Tory and Reform MPs interviewing each other without alternative points of view represented.Tice on NHSThe state and future of the NHS set to be one of this election’s main battlegrounds, and Reform’s key health policy is to spend £17 billion on the NHS on top of its current budget in an effort to get waiting lists down to zero. It also proposes introducing tax relief on private healthcare – something that has been criticised by opponents as a creeping step towards the privatisation of healthcare writ large.Tice’s stated rationale is that the reason the service is struggling is because the money it needs is being spent on other things that the public do not in fact support. Top of the list is Net Zero, which the party and its predecessors have long decried as a pointless “woke” project.In April, Tice used a press conference to frame the choice starkly. “We have a choice in this country, it seems to me,” he said. “A pretty clear choice. Do we want zero waiting lists in two years, and to keep them there? That is the Reform choice. Or do we want net zero CO2 emissions in 25 years? That is the Labour choice.”Tice on immigrationImmigration is by far Reform UK’s top issue, with the party looking to build on Farage’s two decades of campaigning against it in its legal and illegal forms.As far as the election goes, Tice and the party are targeting the continuing arrival of small boats of people travelling across the English Channel, many of them seeking asylum. He has criticised the government for failing to stop “mass immigration” post-Brexit, and described Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda policy as “a disaster”, arguing on GB News that its supposed deterrent value was revealed to be zero just hours after the House of Commons finally passed the law.Reform chairman Richard Tice (L) and leader Nigel Farage speak at the party's economic policy launch at Church House in London. (Alamy Live News)“Within a matter of hours more boats, absolutely packed full, overfilled with illegal migrants, were setting off from the beaches. And we learnt on Tuesday morning that sadly five people, including a young child, drowned leaving the beaches. That's not a deterrent. That's an absolute disaster.”Instead of deporting people to Rwanda, he is arguing for a “pick up and take back” policy that would see small boat arrivals deposited back on French soil. As evidence that this is both practical and humane, he has cited similar policies deployed in the US and Australia.However, he has not addressed the fact that Australia’s policy has been criticised internationally for leaving so-called “boat people” confined to facilities on the island of Nauru, where there have been incidents of suicide and self-immolation.Tice on cost of living crisisPerhaps unsurprisingly given he is trying to peel away former Tory voters, Tice has criticised recent Tory prime ministers harshly for overseeing Britain’s intense cost of living crisis. In 2022, he accused then-prime minister Boris Johnson of “waffling” over the situation. “Clueless, out of touch, no ideas, no help,” he tweeted. “Shocking.”He has also warned that the prospect of a “disastrous” Labour government will offer no prospect of meaningful relief for struggling households.Instead, Reform proposes lifting the minimum level of income tax to £20,000 while cutting various other taxes – among them fuel duty, another gesture to the party’s rejection of environmentalism as a top priority."

Yahoo News UK,"Three important UK election issues, explainedRishi Sunak said his leadership is needed in 'uncertain' times. Keir Starmer said the country needs to be 'rebuilt'. So what issues do voters care about most?","['The economy', 'Health', 'Immigration and asylum']",James Cheng-Morris,Updated 28 May 2024 at 10:11 am·5-min read,28,May,2024,10:11:00,5,"After months of speculation, Rishi Sunak confirmed the general election will be held on 4 July.The prime minister said Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer could not be trusted to lead the country through “uncertain” times. He made the economy and combating global security the key elements of his pitch to the nation as he announced the election date.In response, Starmer told voters: “Together we can stop the chaos, we can turn the page, we can start to rebuild Britain.”But amid this “uncertainty” and need to “rebuild”, what do the voters consider the key issues?This chart, produced using YouGov polling over the course of this parliament, offers an insight in the issues voters care most about and how that has ebbed and flowed over time.Compared to when Boris Johnson's Tories won the December 2019 poll, the economy, immigration, defence and tax have grown in importance in the eyes of the electorate. This has come amid the cost of living crisis; small boats crossing the English Channel; the onset of the Ukraine war and wider global instability; and the highest tax burden in 70 years.Housing has also become a bigger concern, with the Renters Reform Bill - in which the government pledged to scrap no-fault evictions - having been paused after Sunak called the election.Meanwhile, the last general election was fought - and won by the Tories - on a single issue: Brexit. Yet the chart shows a clear downturn in its relevance among voters, particularly after a trade deal was agreed with the EU in December 2020.This next chart, meanwhile, highlights what voters have considered the top issues over the past year. By a wide margin, the top three are the economy, health and immigration and asylum.Here, Yahoo News UK breaks down what is behind these issues and how they have ebbed and flowed in importance among voters since the last election in 2019.The economyThe unprecedented lockdown called by Boris Johnson in March 2020 meant the public’s attention shifted to the economy, as demonstrated by the huge spike in the chart above. The then-chancellor Rishi Sunak was forced to implement a £70bn furlough scheme, lasting 18 months, to protect people’s jobs.There was a second almighty economic shock - and rise in public concern - in February 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This caused a further spike in an already turbulent wholesale energy market, driving up costs for suppliers and ultimately customers.Average energy bills eventually reached £2,500 a year (and would have exceeded £4,000 had the government not intervened). This was double the £1,278 consumers were paying before the war and by the time this election takes place, people will still be paying much more than this: £1,568.Energy prices were also a key driver in inflation reaching 11.1% - a 41-year high - by October 2022, though it has since fallen to 2.3%, which is near the Bank of England’s 2.0% target.The third economic shock of this parliament - and most damaging for the Tories - was in October 2022 when Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng's disastrous “mini budget”, containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, prompted an economic crisis. It led to soaring interest rates, and to this day homeowners who are remortgaging are facing significantly higher bills.HealthHealth, like the economy, is another issue which clearly correlated with the beginning of the pandemic. The above chart shows an enormous spike in public concern when COVID cases started to multiply in March 2020, ultimately leading to the nationwide lockdown as the NHS faced collapse.Cases fell that summer, but spikes in the chart can be seen once infections rose again and fresh nationwide lockdowns were imposed in October 2020 and January 2021. By March 2022, likely as concerns over the Omicron variant faded, there was much less concern about health.In January last year, there was a brief spike as the NHS in England experienced the biggest industrial action in its history, with tens of thousands of nurses and ambulance staff walking out simultaneously.As for the state of play going into the election, NHS waiting lists remain higher than they were when Sunak vowed to cut them last year. According to the latest figures, an estimated 7.54 million treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of March, relating to 6.29 million patients.Immigration and asylumSince the last election, the immigration and asylum narrative has largely revolved around one issue: small boats crossing the English Channel.The numbers have risen in most of the intervening years: there were 1,843 crossings in 2019, 8,466 in 2020, 28,526 in 2021, 45,774 in 2022 and 29,437 last year. This year, the number has already passed the 10,000 mark.The regular sharp spikes in the above chart demonstrate how frequently crossings have been in the news, including some occasions when hundreds of migrants have made the dangerous journey in a single day.But it also reflects how the government has made this part of its own agenda. It was Boris Johnson’s government which first announced plans to deport migrants to Rwanda in April 2022. That policy was picked up by Rishi Sunak when he became prime minister in October that year, with Sunak since repeating his pledge to “stop the boats”.But after calling the election, Sunak admitted this week that flights would not take off before the country goes to the polls.Read moreFive important laws that could be dropped due to Sunak's snap election (Yahoo News UK)OPINION - Rishi Sunak has been in last-ditch campaign mode for so long — a General Election is logical (Evening Standard)Door open for Boris Johnson to campaign for Tories, Rishi Sunak signals (PA Media)"

Many also assume his title is hereditary.So what do you really need to know about the man who, on current poll ratings, is set to be the UK’s next prime minister?His early lifeKeir Starmer was born in Southwark, south London, in 1962, as the second of four children. His parents were Labour Party members and named him after Keir Hardie, the party’s first leader in parliament.The family moved out of the capital and he grew up in Hurst Green, a village just outside the small Surrey town of Oxted. He was active in youth politics from his teenage years but was also a skilled musician, taking music lessons alongside Norman Cook, who later became better known as a member of The Housemartins and the DJ Fatboy Slim.Starmer played the flute, piano, violin and recorder and was a junior exhibitioner at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.His familyStarmer is married to Victoria, a former solicitor who later retrained in occupational health and now works for the NHS. The pair met through their work in the law in the early 2000s and married in Essex in 2007.She was first seen accompanying her husband when the couple were filmed clapping for carers during the pandemic in 2020 outside their home in Camden. They have two children, a son and daughter, but both are kept out of the public eye.Victoria's father was Jewish and originally came from Poland, while her mother converted when they got married. Starmer has said in a previous interview that ""my wife in particular wants our children to know the faith of her family"" and that they ""observe some of the practices, for example Friday night prayers"".Keir Starmer with parents, Rodney and Josephine, at his graduation. (Twitter/Keir Starmer)His parentsThe Labour leader's father, Rodney Starmer, worked as a toolmaker in a factory, and his mother Josephine Starmer (née Baker), was a nurse.His father worked long, 14-hour days but spent his time outside work caring for Josephine, who was diagnosed with the autoimmune condition Still’s disease. She required two hip and knee replacements twice in her lifetime and struggled with arthritic pain.As a young man Starmer also helped care for his mother, which he has said led to him being more emotionally reserved. His sister, Katy, recalled: “He’s had to be a grown-up all his life. I’ve always been quite open about my feelings – Keir is good at most things, but not that.” Josephine Starmer died in 2015, and his father three years later.His educationStarmer passed the 11-plus examination, and attended Reigate Grammar School from age 11. While he was at the school it became an independent fee-paying institution, but as an existing student he was exempt from fees, and his tuition in the sixth form was covered by a bursary.After school he studied law at the University of Leeds, this first in his family to attend university, graduating with a first class degree in 1985. He undertook postgraduate law studied at the University of Oxford, where he served as editor of a radical magazine, Socialist Alternatives.A photograph of a younger Starmer as shown on ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories in 2021. (ITV)Why is he a sir?Stamer was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 2014 in recognition of his work in the legal profession, culminating in a five-year term as Director of Public Prosecutions.He first became a barrister in 1987 at the Middle Temple, later joining Doughty Street Chambers and was appointed a Queen’s Counsel in 2002, aged just 39. In 2008 he was appointed head of the Crown Prosecution Service and DPP.During his tenure he chose to prosecute three Labour MPs and a Conservative in the wake of the parliamentary expenses scandal, and was responsible for prosecuting former MP Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce for perverting the course of justice after Pryce claimed responsibility for her former husband’s speeding offence.Starmer on... the NHSThe Labour leader has said that, if elected, his government would “get the NHS working around the clock and pay staff properly to do it”.The remark followed a commitment to provide £1.1bn in funding for the health service to cut waiting lists by paying doctors and nurses to carry out additional out-of-hours care, which would be funded by axing tax breaks for wealthy “non-doms” who hoard money overseas. He added: “The Conservative Party that brought our NHS to its knees will put it in the ground. We have to get it back on its feet.”Starmer describes the NHS as “the crowdfunded solution for all of us”, reinforcing his commitment to healthcare being free at the point of use, but says reform is inevitable or the health service would “remain on life support”. He has pledged to integrate up-to-date technology into every part of the NHS including using artificial intelligence to diagnose disease earlier and more accurately.He supported the doctors strikes, telling ministers: “Don’t break junior doctors, talk to them. Get in the room [and] sort it out.”Starmer with his wife, Lady Victoria Starmer, at the Labour Party Conference in October 2023. (Alamy)Starmer on… immigrationThe government has “lost control of borders”, according to Labour. Starmer has said a Labour government would set up a new policy unit to tackle illegal migration and has suggested that a returns agreement for asylum seekers could be negotiated with the European Union to solve the small boats crisis.He described the government’s thwarted Rwanda plan, which would see illegal migrants deported to the African nation but has to be put into practice due to legal blocks, as a “gimmick” and a “farce” and has promised to reverse it.Starmer on... the cost of living crisisStarmer has sought to keep Rishi Sunak’s handling of the cost of living crisis in the minds of voters by claiming that “his fingerprints are all over their struggling household budgets”. In a letter to his shadow cabinet, leaked to The Guardian, he wrote: “Rishi Sunak is the chief architect of choices prioritising the wealthiest and of the government’s failure to get a grip of the economy and get growth going.”He has said he would prioritise tackling inflation, blaming it for putting up prices and eroding household savings, but has pledged to “take the difficult and responsible decisions” to bring it down.Starmer pictured in 2010, when he was director of public prosecution at the CPS, making a statement about MPs who face charges over their expenses claims. (Getty)Starmer on... private schoolsLabour has dropped its early promise to scrap charitable status for private schools, but has committed to levying a 20% VAT rate on school fees removing their “unfair tax break”. The money raised, he said, will be used to address the “appalling state” of the school system for all children.“It’s not an attack on private schools. It’s just saying an exemption you have had is going to go,” he warned private schools who have been critical of the plan – reminding them they are not obliged to pass that tax on to parents in the form of increased fees.Starmer on… the House of LordsWhen he was first Labour leader, Starmer proposed a “root and branch reform of the centre of government… rooting out unearned privilege and addressing unaccountable power”.But his promise to scrap the House of Lords within the first four years of a new parliament - a controversial move that caused a split among his party’s grandees, has been abandoned.Starmer still backs plans for a second chamber “electoral legitimacy”, but as his party nears government he has stepped away from the most radical form of that pledge. He is now reportedly committed to cutting the number of hereditary peers, reducing the size of the chamber and introducing a new appointments process."

The other 11 so-called “dirty dozen” include:Craig Williams, Mr Sunak’s parliamentary private secretary standing in Montgomeryshire, and Laura Saunders, who has worked for the Tories since 2015, married to director of campaigning Tony Lee, and standing in Bristol North West, who are both being investigated by the Gambling Commission for betting on the election date shortly before it was called.Ms Saunders has not responded, but Mr Williams said: “I clearly made a huge error of judgement that’s for sure and I apologise.”Mr Sunak said he was “extremely angry” about the scandal but insisted he cannot suspend people while the investigation is underway warning those found guilty will be expelled from the Tories.Marco Longhi, standing in Dudley, is accused of stoking ethnic divisions with a letter addressed to “voters of the British Pakistani/ Kashmiri community” asking who they thought would speak up for Kashmir, him or Labour rival Sonia Kumar, with her common Indian surname in bold, underlined, capital letters.Rishi Sunak is under pressure in the closing stages of the campaign (AP)Mr Longhi denied stoking ethnic tensions, saying: “I don’t know what her ethnicity or religious background is. I am not trying to stoke division. I will always stand up for abuses of human rights wherever they take place.”Stephen James, Dover and Deal, is accused of using AI to produce an antisemitic cartoon depicting men with hooked noses at the white cliffs of Dover carrying bags of “false hopes”, then using it in a now-deleted social media post attacking so-called “carpetbaggers” standing in the seat.Mr James has “unequivocally apologised” and said that the image had been created from famous historic cartoons by Thomas Nast and Gerald Scarfe.He said: “As someone who has written for The Times of Israel on antisemitism, I am acutely aware of the importance of vigilance against such instances. AI has safeguards to prevent the creation of offensive images, but on this occasion, it fell short and I shall be extra vigilant going forward. I apologise wholeheartedly for any offence caused by this image.”Rose Hulse (centre) is one of the candidates being scrutinised (@BSGMatters/X)Rose Hulse, Bristol North East, standing against Jewish Labour candidate Damien Egan, liked posts on social media referring to Mr Egan as a “fiend of Israel”, and another that accused Labour leader Keir Starmer of “tap dancing” to the idea that “AntiSemitismIsAllThatMatters”.Ms Hulse told The Independent: “The tweet referenced was clicked in error. As soon as I realised, I immediately deselected the tweet. I apologise for any offence caused.”Darren Millar, Clwyd North, was filmed bowing before an alleged Islamophobic hate preacher while he delivered a sermon at the launch of a bible centre in Wales, and has been revealed to have links with another pastor accused of homophobia.Mr Millar told the BBC he did not endorse the views of the pastors adding: “No one should be discriminated against on the basis of their sexual orientation or religious beliefs.”Lee Roberts, Putney, described London mayor Sadiq Khan as a “snivelling little drip” who had done more to damage the capital “than the Luftwaffe”.After the recording came to light, Mr Roberts said: “I would like to apologise for my comments.

It’s not something that I would do or take part in now.”Ashley Fox, Bridgwater, is accused of lying to MPs about his political ambitions when they vetted his candidacy to head up the Independent Monitoring Authority. He told the justice select committee he would not run for political office if appointed.Fox said: “I have now stepped down from the IMA. I am very proud to have been selected as the Conservative candidate for Bridgwater and am looking forward to the election on 4 July.”Commenting for Labour, Mr Ashworth said: “While Labour took immediate action this week to suspend the one candidate for our party against whom serious allegations have been made, Rishi Sunak has refused to take any action against the ‘dirty dozen’ of Tory candidates, who stand accused of acts ranging from blatant corruption to dog-whistle racism.“This is not just about Rishi Sunak’s weak leadership, it is about his basic lack of backbone and principle. If any Labour candidate had done any of the things these 12 Tories have been accused of, Keir Starmer would have had them out the door before their feet could touch the ground.”The Independent has contacted the Conservative Party for further comment."
