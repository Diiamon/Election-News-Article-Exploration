The Telegraph,France election 2024: Everything you need to know,"['When is the French election and how will it work?', 'When will the results be announced?', 'Who is in the running?', 'What is cohabitation?', 'What are the possible outcomes?', 'What happens if there’s no majority?', 'Why has Emmanuel Macron called an election?']",James Rothwell,1 July 2024 at 3:33 am·6-min read,1,July,2024,03:33:00,6,"France goes to the polls on Sunday July 7 for the second round of its most crucial election in decades.In the first round last night, the hard-Right National Rally took the biggest share of the vote, winning 33 per cent, while the Left-wing New Popular Front is expected to come second with about 28 per cent and Mr Macron’s Together coalition was in third with 20 per cent, according to the interior ministry.President Emmanuel Macron called the vote after he was trounced by Marine Le Pen’s National Rally in European elections in June. It was a momentous decision that shocked France and took Mr Macron’s closest aides by surprise, according to some reports.Mr Macron said at the time the European results forced his hand in declaring this election, which he had hoped would be a chance for voters to reject the hard-Right and put him back in the driving seat.But critics said it was a reckless gamble which could backfire spectacularly by propelling the hard-Right into government.When is the French election and how will it work?The first round of legislative elections to choose députés (MPs) for France’s National Assembly (lower house of parliament) took place on June 30. The more than 60 candidates who received more than 50 per cent of the vote in their constituency were automatically elected. All others will go to a run-off vote on July 7.Any candidate who secured the support of more than 12.5 per cent of registered voters in the first round will progress to the second. Whoever gets the most votes in the second round wins the seat.In many districts, three people made it to the second round, though some tactics to block hard-Right candidates have already been announced: The Left-wing coalition said it would withdraw its candidates in districts when they arrived in third position in order to support other politicians opposed to the far Right.In the first round, voters tend to choose with their hearts not their heads, picking the candidate who best reflects their values. But in the second round, it becomes more tactical. Sometimes a weaker candidate steps aside so it becomes a two-horse race, for example between a mainstream candidate and hard-Right candidate. This can allow voters of various views to band together to block a rival whom they deem beyond the pale.The alliance which manages to secure a majority in the lower house of parliament then forms a government to serve under the president.When will the results be announced?The second round of voting is due to take place on Sunday July 7.Voting ends at 8pm local time (7pm BST), when pollsters publish nationwide projections based on a partial vote count.These are usually reliable, with official results trickling in from 8pm.Vote counting is usually fast and efficient and the winners of all, or nearly all, seats will be known by the end of the evening.Who is in the running?The frontrunner in this race is the hard-Right National Rally, led by Marine Le Pen in parliament and overall by Jordan Bardella, a youthful, energetic new face in the party.In second place is a Left-wing alliance, the Popular Front, formed from centre-Left, hard-Left and Green parties.Trailing them both in third place is Mr Macron’s centrist alliance Ensemble, which has been on the ropes since losing its absolute majority in parliament in 2022.It remains unclear whether any party or alliance - most likely the National Rally - will manage to secure an absolute majority in parliament.President Macron is expected to remain in office regardless, but without a majority he will have to engage in a French political system called “cohabitation”.What is cohabitation?When the president’s own alliance has no majority, he must appoint a prime minister from the alliance which beat him; this is very rare.It has happened only three times in the history of the modern Republic, once when Jacques Chirac, conservative president, appointed Lionel Jospin, the socialist prime minister, in 1997.Whoever that prime minister might be – the polls suggest the National Rally leader – they will be accountable to parliament, lead the government and introduce bills.The president retains some authority over foreign policy, such as holding the nuclear codes, and in theory they can veto the prime minister’s laws, though parliament can overrule this with its majority.If the National Rally secures an absolute majority, Mr Macron will be left as a lame duck.What are the possible outcomes?This is an election like no other in France: campaign time is short, the electoral landscape is shaken, and so other scenarios cannot be excluded.These include a paralysed National Assembly divided into three groups with no one party dominating it, or an alliance of mainstream parties to keep the hard-Right out of power. An absolute majority requires at least 289 seats.Ms Le Pen’s National Rally could run a minority government if it wins the most seats without reaching that threshold, but 28-year-old party leader Mr Bardella has said he wants an absolute majority as without it he will not be able to carry out reforms.What happens if there’s no majority?The president can name a prime minister from the parliamentary group with the most seats at the National Assembly — this was the case of Mr Macron’s own centrist alliance since 2022.Yet the National Rally already said it would reject such an option, because it would mean a far-Right government could soon be overthrown through a no-confidence vote if other political parties join together.The president could try to build a broad coalition from the left to the right, an option that sounds unlikely, given the political divergences.Prime Minister Gabriel Attal hoped Sunday to be able to have enough centrist lawmakers to build “a majority of projects and ideas” with other “Republican forces,” which may include those from the centre-Left and the centre-Right.Experts said another complex option would be to appoint “a government of experts” unaffiliated with political parties but which would still need to be accepted by a majority at the National Assembly. Such a government would likely deal mostly with day-to-day affairs rather than implementing major reforms.Why has Emmanuel Macron called an election?Critics of Mr Macron will argue this was a hubristic move that dooms his leadership and will hasten the rise of the hard-Right in France.Ms Le Pen has for years been working hard to clean up her party’s image and style herself as the co-leader of a new party of government. Now that goal is tantalisingly close, thanks in large part to Mr Macron’s decision.However, the French president was already under immense pressure from the National Rally due to its soaring popularity over the course of his presidency. In calling the election, he has an opportunity to take the initiative and fight on his own terms.And at first this tactic did seem effective: it initially threw the French Right into total disarray as they argued over the shape of their anti-Macron alliance.Unfortunately for the president, it did not catch the French Left off-guard in the same way; they swiftly formed a cogent alliance which has now taken second place, ahead of Mr Macron. Meanwhile, the hard-Right managed to surge into first place."

Yahoo News UK,"Who is Rishi Sunak? PM battles to stay in power after election gambleAs the prime minister calls a snap election, here’s everything you need to know about Rishi Sunak and what he’s saying about the biggest issues in British politics","['Early life', ""Sunak's family"", 'His parents', 'His education', 'How much is he worth?', 'His religion', 'Sunak on... the NHS', 'Sunak on… immigration', 'Sunak on... the cost of living crisis', 'Sunak on... pensions']",Hannah Fearn,23 May 2024 at 7:21 am·8-min read,23,May,2024,07:21:00,8,"Rishi Sunak has the fight of his political life ahead of him after calling a snap general election for 4 July. The polls have consistently painted a very bleak picture for the prime minister, with Labour holding on to a double-digit poll lead over his Conservatives.Recent by-election results suggest that Labour is likely to win a landslide victory – but there’s still time for the PM to turn it around.Here’s everything you need to know about Sunak and what’s he’s saying about the biggest issues in British politics right now.Early lifeSunak was born in Southampton in 1980, the eldest of three children. His Indian parents both arrived from East Africa in the 1960s. A football-mad boy whose childhood idol was Matt Le Tissier, Sunak was described by the family’s neighbours as a child with “lovely manners”.In his youngest years, the PM attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. According to a recent biography, fellow pupil Ollie Case said: “He was someone that was talked about. The teachers would say: ‘He’s going to be prime minister'.""But, growing up in the 1980s and 90s, he also remembers experiencing racism. “My mother was obsessed with us not having accents,” Sunak has said.Rishi Sunak was football-mad as a boy growing up in Southampton. (ITV)Sunak's familySunak is married to Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian entrepreneur and multi-billionaire. The pair first met in 2004 at Stanford University, his future wife apparently attracted to his “honesty and integrity”.Five years later they married in a two-day Indian wedding held in Bangalore. The couple have two daughters, Krishna and Anoushka, who will turn 13 and 11 this year, both of whom are largely kept out of the public eye.Sunak attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. (Rishi Sunak, Instagram)His parentsYashvir Sunak, Rishi’s father, was born in Kenya. He arrived in the UK to study medicine and then stayed, becoming an NHS GP. His mother, Usha, was born in Tanzania and is a pharmacist.The couple met in Britain and settled in Southampton in the 1970s. Usha is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.His educationAs a teenager Sunak studied at Winchester College where he was, he says, a self-confessed “geek”. According to a recent biography, the “naughtiest” thing the prime minister did during his school days “was to smuggle a hand-held television into the school so that he did not miss any key games of Euro 96”.The childhood home of Rishi Sunak in Southampton. (Getty Images, photo taken in 2022)Perhaps unsurprisingly for someone with such an unblemished record, he went on to become the school’s head boy. Sunak worked while studying, delivering medicines for his mother’s pharmacy and as a waiter at a local Indian restaurant.After school, Sunk read philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, graduating in 2001 with a first class degree. While still at university he held an internship at the Conservative Party campaign headquarters and joined the party, but went on studying before entering politics.He earned his MBA from Stanford in 2006 as a Fulbright Scholar, meaning he was selected among the most promising candidates from the UK.How much is he worth?As prime minister, Rishi Sunak earns £80,807 on top of a salary of £84,144 for being an MP. But his current income from Westminster pales in comparison to his family’s vast wealth through marriage.The Sunday Times valued the couple’s joint fortune at £730m. Murty's father is the co-founder of Infosys, an Indian tech conglomerate, in which she holds shares estimated at around £430m. Her family is also involved in a £900m business arrangement with Amazon in India, and she is a shareholder of multiple other companies.Rishi Sunak's mother is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.Before entering politics Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and a series of hedge funds. He is also known to have invested in blind trusts, in which investments are made without holders knowing where the funds are located. These arrangements reportedly hold Sunak’s own multi-million-pound fortune.His religionSunak is not only the first prime minister of colour and of Indian heritage but he is also the first practising Hindu to hold the biggest job in UK politics.He has spoken of his pride in his Hindu faith, saying, “that’s how I was raised, and that’s how I am”. He said: “Having faith gives you resilience, gives you strength that is important and it provides an outlook on life which I find particularly valuable.”Sunak on... the NHSThe prime minister’s biggest challenge in office has been the crisis in the NHS - and to many people in the sector his government has been found wanting. “We have not made enough progress,” Sunak said when asked about his commitment to cut NHS waiting lists during an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV. Asked if that meant he had failed, the prime minister replied: “Yes, we have.""Sunak expects to see waiting lists start to reduce this spring, and blames the delays on “industrial action”, as disputes with junior doctors and consultants over pay and conditions continue. Yet Sunak himself has been blamed for holding up a deal that would prevent more walkouts.Sunak, his wife Akshata and daughters Anoushka and Krishna (second left) at Santa Monica Pier, California, on their summer holiday in 2023. (AP)Sunak on… immigrationAccording to the prime minister, illegal migration threatens to “overwhelm” Europe. In June 2023 he claimed his plan to “stop the boats” and tackle illegal immigration was working, but by August 2023 he had changed his mind: “It’s not an easy problem to fix,” he told broadcasters. “I never said we would be able to solve it overnight.”He has staked much of his reputation on the government's Rwanda Bill - his plan to deport asylum seekers to the east African country that finally became law last month, after months of legal and procedural challenges. It has paved the way for deportation flights to get off the ground within weeks.He described his policy, which he says will act as a deterrent to people traffickers, as being “the will of the people” – yet polling suggests low support for such a punitive approach.The policy, coupled with Conservative talk of limits on legal migration, shows that the government is committed to taking a hard line on the issue, despite the risk of alienating more moderate voters.The Rwanda policy is not universally popular. (YouGov)Sunak on... the cost of living crisisThe prime minister has told hard-pressed working families that they will feel some relief from the cost of living crisis as inflation continues to drop following its highs of October 2022. He described the government’s tax cuts as “meaningful” and has welcomed the dip in mortgage rates at the turn of the year.Sunak says falling inflation will have the biggest impact on family budgets “and will start to ease some of those pressures” and that he was right to focus on that figure. However, the global drop in energy prices is probably the biggest factor in easing the hit on wallets - something that the prime minister has no control over.However, the fall in inflation to 2.3% on 22 May this year – the lowest it has been in nearly three years – was likely one of the key factors in persuading Sunak to call a snap election many weeks earlier than experts had predicted.Can we expect more handouts or tax breaks to help balance family budgets? Not according to Sunak, who has warned voters that it’s time to “move on” from government support.Sunak on... pensionsThe triple-lock pensions policy is a tricky one for Sunak – especially since Labour has committed to retaining the policy. Any change to a policy that has become a hallmark of recent Conservative governments would not go down well with the 12 million pensioners it would likely impact – many of whom are lifelong Tory voters.Last November, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said pensions should start being pegged to an average of inflation and wage growth, which would help reduce state spending over time.Sunak’s response to that was ambiguous to say the least: “We are the government that has … delivered the triple lock and it is why, right now, pensions are, depending on how you look at it, £800 or £900 bigger than they otherwise would have been.” He is yet to confirm whether it will appear in the manifesto."
Yahoo News UK,"Will Nigel Farage's Reform UK 'beat' the Tories in the election?With some polling figures putting the Tories and Reform UK nearly neck and neck, could Farage's party really end up with nearly as many MPs as Sunak's?","['What do the latest polls say?', 'Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?', 'Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?', 'What is proportional representation?']",James Cheng-Morris and  Ellen Manning,Updated 14 June 2024 at 6:33 am·7-min read,14,June,2024,06:33:00,7,"Leading pollster John Curtice has poured cold water on suggestions that Reform UK is now beating the Conservative Party in the general election polls.As representatives from seven parties took prepared to take part in a TV debate on Thursday, a YouGov survey for The Times newspaper said Reform’s support had increased by two points to 19%, putting them ahead of the Tories for the first time.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage took the the opportunity to hail the poll results in the debate, declaring: “We are now the opposition to Labour.”But Curtice urged caution, insisting that single polls should not be relied on. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""This is one poll - we’ve actually, I think, had four other polls published in the last 24 hours - none of which have had Reform ahead, not even all of which have had Reform gaining ground, but quite a couple of them certainly suggesting it’s also got very close.""He said it may not be the case that Reform are ahead - and could be on average four or five points behind. But he said: ""This is still bad news for the Conservatives. The only way Rishi Sunak can hope to get even to base camp in narrowing the lead that Labour have started off with this campaign was to squeeze the Reform vote.""He added: ""Rather than making progress, things are actually going backwards, not least of course because of Nigel Farage’s decision to fight this campaign.""With many speculating that Reform UK with Farage at the helm could ""beat"" the Tories, Yahoo News UK takes a look.What do the latest polls say?YouGov’s voting intention tracker, updated on Tuesday, suggests the Tories and Reform UK are neck and neck.With Labour well ahead on 38%, the Tories are trailing on 18% – compared to a high of 53% under Boris Johnson in 2020 – with Reform UK just behind on 17% and the Liberal Democrats on 15%.However, there are multiple polls taking place at any one time by a number of different companies.According to the PA news agency, an average of all polls that were carried out wholly or partly during the seven days to June 13 puts Labour on 43%, 21 points ahead of the Conservatives on 22%, followed by Reform on 14%, the Lib Dems on 10% and the Greens on 6%.And while Reform’s average is up one percentage point on the figure for the previous week and the Tories are down one point, there is still an eight-point gap, on average, between the two.Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?Unless something remarkable happens, in short: 'No' - and that's because of the first past the post (FPTP) voting system in which the candidate with the largest number of votes in their constituency is elected.According to the Electoral Reform Society, which is against FPTP, this system leads to a situation where “even if millions of voters support the same party, if they are thinly spread out across the UK they may only get the largest number of votes in a couple of these contests – so only win a few MPs"".“Tens of thousands of voters supporting a different party, but who live near each other, could end up with more MPs. This means the number of MPs a party has in parliament rarely matches their popularity with the public.”Rishi Sunak on the campaign trail on Wednesday. (AFP via Getty Images)Farage knows this well. As the leader of UKIP in the 2015 election, he saw his party win 12.6% of the nationwide vote and one seat. The Liberal Democrats won 7.9% of the vote... and eight seats.Indeed, YouGov last week released a poll – put together using the multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) surveying technique, from a sample size of nearly 60,000 respondents – which suggested the Tories would win just 140 seats, having won 365 in 2019. But this is still 140 more than the zero it projected Reform UK to win, in spite of its strong polling figures.The model had Reform UK ""performing strongly in a number of seats but still a long way off winning in any"", with projected second-placed finishes in 27 constituencies.YouGov's MRP projection. (YouGov)Granted, this model was formed between 24 May and 1 June, before Farage's headline-grabbing intervention on Monday last week in which he announced he would be standing as an MP.But, even as Reform UK polls closer than ever to the Tories, it's difficult to imagine the party winning more than a handful of seats.Chris Hopkins, director at polling firm Savanta, told Yahoo News UK that in one respect, Reform UK is at an advantage compared to Ukip in 2015 because ""Ukip took votes from both Labour and the Conservatives, and we are not seeing that with Reform UK – they are all coming from the Conservatives.""That is the consequence of Rishi Sunak making immigration a centrepiece of the campaign and failing to deliver on it. Even if you have voters that are neutral on immigration, they would say the small boats policy has been a disaster.""But even so, Hopkins said, Reform UK is still ""at a huge electoral disadvantage"" in that its votes are not very concentrated, they are very evenly spread.""There are going to be some races where Reform UK is strong - the Nigel Farage factor in Clacton is really interesting - but realistically its ceiling is five seats: and that’s a high ceiling.""Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey on a campaign visit in Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire, on Wednesday. (PA)Like Reform UK, Sir Ed Davey’s Liberal Democrats are performing well in the polls.In a sign of how defensive the Tory campaign is becoming, one online party advert claims voting for Reform UK or the Lib Dems could give Labour 100 extra seats, resulting in the biggest majority in its history.It depicts a scenario where the Conservatives are beaten into third place behind the Lib Dems, with just 57 seats, despite getting 19% of the vote and without Reform winning a single seat.Read more: Pollsters got it wrong in 2015, so could Labour’s lead be overestimated? (The Guardian)However, it remains unlikely the Lib Dems will finish second. YouGov’s MRP poll projected the party performing strongly, winning 48 seats. This would be up 37 from 2019, but still nowhere near the Tories’ projected 140.However, amid all this talk about projections, it’s worth remembering they are still only polls and not a definite indicator of how people will vote on 4 July. The 1992 and 2015 elections are notable examples of how polling didn’t match the end results of Tory wins.What is proportional representation?Proportional representation, as defined by the UK parliament, is an electoral system ""in which the distribution of seats corresponds closely with the proportion of the total votes cast for each party. For example, if a party gained 40% of the total votes, a perfectly proportional system would allow them to gain 40% of the seats.""This differs from the first past the post system, as set out above, in that a relatively high vote share rarely corresponds with increased seats for the smaller parties. In 2019, for example, the Lib Dems won 11.5% of the vote but only 1.7% – 11 – of the 650 seats.Unsurprisingly, both Reform UK and the Lib Dems support proportional representation.The Lib Dems this week made it part of their manifesto, with the party saying it would introduce the single transferrable vote method, a form of proportional representation which allows electors to rank their preference of candidates on the ballot.The party previously sought to change the UK’s voting system while in the coalition government under then-leader Nick Clegg, but voters rejected the plan in a 2011 referendum.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

The Telegraph,Keir Starmer profile: The grammar school ‘superboy’ who could be the next Labour PM,[],Gordon Rayner,1 July 2024 at 3:20 am·17-min read,1,July,2024,03:20:00,17,"There is a story that Sir Keir Starmer’s friends like to tell about his response to Labour’s humiliating Hartlepool by-election defeat in 2021.Having lost the safe seat to the Conservatives, Sir Keir openly discussed quitting as the Labour leader, saying: “I’m not fulfilling some lifelong dream here.” He told his confidants he would be content to work in a bookshop instead.It is undoubtedly true that Sir Keir’s leadership ambitions came late in life. It is also the case that Labour never expected him to be the party’s next prime minister, and from the public’s point of view there is still considerable confusion over what he stands for.Yet opinion polls consistently point to Sir Keir – who came so close to walking off the political stage entirely – as the next occupant of 10 Downing Street.Read the latest election pollsFollow The Telegraph’s general election live coverageThat he has turned a 20-point deficit in those polls into a 21-point lead in his time as leader owes much to the Tories’ self-immolation, but it would be wrong to dismiss Sir Keir’s contribution to that turnaround.Keir Starmer working in his flat above a sauna and massage parlour in the 1980s - HARPER COLLINSBy purging Labour of Momentum, Jeremy Corbyn and anti-Semites, Sir Keir has done much to detoxify the brand. Before voters go to the polls, however, they will want to be sure that they know what they are getting if they are tempted to vote Labour – and that means knowing more about the man who leads the party.Even Sir Keir’s tame biographer Tom Baldwin, a former adviser to their mutual friend Ed Miliband, describes him as “peculiarly hard to pin down”, which is not an encouraging start for those tasked with curating the image of a would-be prime minister.Sir Keir has summed up his political outlook by saying: “If I see something wrong or spot an injustice, I want to put it right,” a phrase that might have been uttered by any politician, of any party, at any point in time.He has also proudly described how one of his achievements as director of public prosecutions (DPP) was “getting the boring stuff right”.In time, that phrase might be equally applicable as a description of how he ended up in charge of the country at the age of 61.Sir Keir said he got 'the boring stuff right' during his time as director of public prosecutions - JOHN STILLWELL/PAUnlike Sir Tony Blair, the last Labour leader to win a general election, Sir Keir can genuinely lay claim to working-class roots. But where Sir Tony was unapologetic about his middle-class status, Starmer appears uncomfortable with the man he has become.Sir Keir has so often referred to his father’s occupation as a toolmaker that it has become the go-to punchline for political cartoonists.Much ink has been expended in arguing about whether Rodney Starmer was a mere factory hand or the boss of his own one-man business, but there is no doubting the fact that Sir Keir’s childhood was lived in straitened circumstances that moulded the man we see today.Sir Keir was born on Sep 2, 1962, the second of four children. His older sister, Anna, was born the year before him and twins, Katy and Nick, followed in 1964.Soon after he was born, the family moved to the pebble-dashed home in Hurst Green, near Oxted, to which he so often refers, saying it gave the family stability.Money was tight: Katy has said that the house flooded once and it was years before they could afford to redecorate, and when Sir Keir kicked a football through a back window his father boarded it up, unable to pay for a glazer.His mother Josephine, a nurse, had Still’s disease, a rare type of inflammatory arthritis which meant she had to have her hips and knees replaced twice and became a wheelchair user in later life.Some of Sir Keir’s friends have suggested in the past that if he appears lacking in emotion, it is a result of growing up with a parent who had a serious illness, which leads a child to suppress their own needs and feelings.Added to that was the fact that his brother Nick had learning difficulties, which meant Sir Keir’s parents had a lot on their hands.He was not afraid to use his fists as a child and would get into fights with people who bullied his brother, with whom he shared a bunk bed decorated with posters of Debbie Harry, the Blondie singer.He now says he has no patience for people who complain about being ill when they are not very ill, and that the challenges he faces as a politician “pale into insignificance” compared with what his mother had to face.Childhood friends of Sir Keir say his father, a staunch Labour supporter, was powerfully built and physically intimidating and would interrogate visitors about their political views.Sir Keir has gone as far as to say that his father was “a difficult sod” who “drove people away” and had no time for other people’s opinions. Family meals would be eaten in silence while Mr Starmer read his newspaper, and he only allowed a television in the house when Josephine took an Open University course (Sir Keir was only allowed to watch one programme per week: Match of the Day).Sir Keir now thinks his father “carried quite heavily” a belief that other people looked down on him because he was a manual worker, even though he believes he was bright enough to have gone to university if he had lived in a different era.Sir Keir at his wedding with wife Victoria, father Rodney and mother Josephine, who has Still's disease - KEIR STARMER/LABOUR PARTYFamily holidays were spent in the Lake District when the four children and their four dogs would all cram into the back seat of Mr Starmer’s Ford Cortina.Mr and Mrs Starmer fell in love with the Lakes when they went there on honeymoon (the only time in her life that Josephine flew on an aircraft, to Manchester) and visited 77 times. They also became lifelong friends with Alfred Wainwright, the Lakeland author, after coming across him in the hills.The four Starmer siblings all attended a primary school in the village of Merle Common, around four miles from Tanhouse Road. Sir Keir passed the 11-plus and went to Reigate Grammar School, unlike his three siblings, who called him “superboy” because he was so good at everything, from academia to music to football.He became such an accomplished flautist that on Saturdays he went to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, where he had a youth scholarship. Unsurprisingly, he also became a prefect and attained a Gold Duke of Edinburgh’s Award.His attendance at Reigate Grammar School would prove controversial in later life. It would have become a comprehensive school had it not been for a directive issued by Margaret Thatcher as education secretary, and instead went private, though boys who were already at the school, including Sir Keir, did not have to pay.Keir Starmer in his first year at Reigate Grammar School in 1974 - HARPER COLLINSCuriously, Sir Keir omitted any mention of the school in his Who’s Who entry when he first became DPP. He now wants to put VAT on school fees yet he has contributed to Reigate’s scholarship fund and has spoken at fundraising events. The Daily Mail has given him an “A* for hypocrisy” as a result.After a gap year which he divided between an outdoor pursuits centre for disabled children near Bodmin Moor and working in his father’s workshop, he won a place at the University of Leeds to study law, gaining a first-class degree.During his time there he went on demonstrations and gave money to miners’ families during the strike in 1984, but he refuses to answer questions about whether he took drugs as a student, preferring to say he “had a very good time at university”. It included dating Angela O’Brien, a fellow law student with whom he had a 10-year relationship.He also joined the university Labour Club, though he never ran for any posts within it and many prominent members of it have no memory of him attending at all. Like Lord Cameron, Sir Keir seems to have treated student politics as a passing interest rather than an all-consuming passion.A one-year Bachelor of Civil Law course at St Edmund Hall, University of Oxford followed, before a three-year spell working as the legal officer for Liberty, then called the National Council for Civil Liberties. At weekends, he gave free legal advice to women who worked in a massage parlour below his flat, that may or may not have been an actual massage parlour.Sir Keir Starmer celebrating his first-class degree in Law from the University of Leeds with his parents Rod and Jo in 1985 - HARPER COLLINSFreed from the intensity of his university studies, Sir Keir finally had time to devote to his hobby of politics and decided that the Labour Party was not radical enough for his liking. He joined the Socialist Society, founded by Ralph Miliband, Ed and David’s father, and Tony Benn, and helped set up a magazine called Socialist Alternatives, dedicated to an obscure branch of Trotskyism called Pabloism. It attacked Neil Kinnock’s “hopeless” economic programme and demanded a “radical alternative”.At the time, Sir Keir had such liberal beliefs on law and order that one friend has recalled him saying he did not believe in imprisonment “for anything, ever”.He expressed similarly naive views when he was interviewed for pupillage at his first barrister’s chambers. Asked how he would defend a first-time shoplifter he said: “Isn’t all property theft?”Nevertheless, he was taken on by Doughty Street Chambers, founded by the prominent human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson. Its premises were next door to the offices of the Spectator magazine, edited at the time by Boris Johnson.Sir Keir made a name for himself by giving free legal advice to the defendants in the “McLibel” case, in which McDonald’s sued two environmental activists over a factsheet critical of the burger chain. He appeared in a documentary about the case talking about how being made a Queen’s Counsel was odd because he used to campaign for the abolition of the monarchy.By 1997 he had made enough money as a barrister to buy a house in Stoke Newington with his new girlfriend and fellow barrister, Phillippa Kaufmann.They were together for six years and she still lives in the house they bought together. Then came a relationship with another lawyer, Julie Morris, a former gymnast, before Sir Keir met the woman he would finally marry, solicitor Victoria Alexander.Sir Keir's wife Victoria worked as a volunteer at Sir Tony Blair's campaign headquarters in 1997 - GETTYVictoria, who worked as a volunteer at Sir Tony’s campaign headquarters in 1997, is a decade younger than her husband and was far more politically active as a student than he had been.Her father was part of a Jewish family who arrived in England from Poland before the Second World War.The couple married on May 6, 2007, at the Fennes Estate in Essex, when Sir Keir was 44. By 2010 they had a son and a daughter, whom they occasionally take to a liberal synagogue in north London (though neither Sir Keir nor his wife professes to be religious).Back at Doughty Street Chambers, Sir Keir was busily fighting the government over the ongoing Iraq War, taking on, and beating, the Home Office in a series of cases that prevented control orders being imposed on suspected terrorists whom the security services feared would travel to Iraq to fight against the US-led coalition.By 2008 he had built such a legend within the legal world that he was offered the job of DPP, putting him in charge of 8,000 people in the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and hundreds of thousands of prosecutions.He has picked out one of his key achievements as replacing a paper-based system with a digital one, which meant fewer prosecutions were abandoned because of lost paperwork. It is this that he has cited as an example of how “getting the boring stuff right” can improve lives.One thing he did not do as DPP was prosecute Jimmy Savile. It was under his watch that the CPS decided not to prosecute the prolific paedophile on the grounds of insufficient evidence, a decision that was later criticised in a review of the case by a leading barrister. Sir Keir has always maintained the case did not come across his desk.One of the unfortunate consequences of the missed opportunity over Savile was Operation Midland, which dragged innocent men into an investigation about a VIP paedophile ring that was the invention of a fantasist called Carl Beech.After the Savile debacle, Sir Keir had authorised policy changes for dealing with sexual abuse cases that placed more emphasis on believing the purported victim.Sir Keir is often blamed for the 'believe the victim' mentality that allowed fantastist Carl Beech's claims to go unquestioned for so long - DAVID ROSEThe former Tory MP Harvey Proctor, who was falsely accused by Beech, blames Sir Keir personally for the “believe the victim” policy that cost him his job, his reputation and his home after he was wrongly accused. Some of Beech’s victims later said Sir Keir was unfit to stand as Labour leader.By the 2010s, Sir Keir had decided that he had achieved as much as he could as a lawyer. He told his biographer Tom Baldwin that there were limits to legal justice and he wanted to be part of the apparatus of making the laws.“I had a sense that to fix problems you had to pull levers only politicians could do,” he said. “I wanted to be part of making social justice.”He consulted his near neighbour Ed Miliband, who lives half a mile from him, and when Frank Dobson stood down from the Holborn and St Pancras seat in 2015, Sir Keir was picked as the candidate to replace him.He has lived in the constituency for more than 20 years, has a wallet with “Take Me Home To Kentish Town” written on the back, and is, of course, a fanatical supporter of Arsenal FC.He still plays football with friends he has had for decades, does so wearing a Donegal County Gaelic football shirt that he picked up when he was in Northern Ireland advising its police force, and, until recently at least, remained in charge of booking the pitch, team selection and contacting the players with details of when to arrive.Sir Keir pictured playing football in a Dongeal Gaelic Football top in North London in 2021 - GAVIN RODGERS/PIXEL8000When he was elected to Parliament at the age of 52, it would have been a proud moment for his mother, who had been struggling with her health, but she did not live to see it. In 2008 she had fallen and broken her leg, which had to be amputated. She also lost the power of speech.Mr Starmer used his engineering skills to make her a wheelchair adapted to her exact needs, and built an outhouse at the end of their garden where she could sit and be near the donkeys that the couple rescued and kept in a field that their MP son had bought for them.Mr Starmer planned out how he would get his disabled wife to Parliament to see his eldest son being sworn in as an MP in 2015, but she died a few days before he was elected, and Mr Starmer decided not to go on his own.Heartbroken, he moved into the outhouse he had built for his wife, putting her wedding ring beside the bed. He visited her grave most days, having his sandwich lunch there, even on Christmas Day.When Mr Starmer himself later ended up in hospital, there was a fire in the outhouse, destroying all of the photos and memories of their life together, and killing his dog. His children never told him, and he died in hospital without knowing. Sir Keir later found a scrapbook his father had kept, full of cuttings about his career, and friends said that after his wife died, they would find Mr Starmer sitting watching the BBC Parliament channel in the hope of catching sight of his son.In Parliament, Sir Keir chose to serve on Jeremy Corbyn’s front bench as shadow Brexit secretary, a decision that has dogged him ever since.He says he profoundly disagreed with Mr Corbyn, yet he stayed on his team. He says he accepts Brexit, but he campaigned for a second referendum, with Remain as an option. Rishi Sunak accuses him of blowing with the wind, unable to decide what he stands for other than seizing power.Sir Keir is a big football fan and supports Arsenal - LABOUR PARTYKnighted for his services as DPP, he insists on being called simply Keir Starmer in Parliament. Critics find this peculiar: his is a story of social mobility, of a man born without privilege who raised himself to high office through his own endeavours and with the help of an education system that includes good schools and world-class universities, yet he is somehow reluctant to celebrate this success. Instead, he constantly plays up his working-class roots, leaves his grammar school out of his biography and plays down his knighthood.Where Sir Tony had the self-confidence to own his middle-class status, turning it to his advantage by telling Tory voters he was not so different from them, Sir Keir, another north London lawyer, appears uncomfortable with his success, and this is surely one of the reasons that voters find him difficult to warm to.Colleagues say he first started talking about becoming leader when Mr Corbyn refused to blame Moscow for the Salisbury poisonings in 2018.In 2020 he got the job, making his victory speech from his living room because of the Covid pandemic. In it, he described anti-Semitism as “a stain on our party” and promised to “tear out this poison by its roots and judge success by the return of Jewish members and those who felt that they could no longer support us”.Many Labour MPs thought he didn’t have it in him. Yet he matched words with action, sacking his beaten leadership rival Rebecca Long-Bailey for sharing online an interview in which the actor Maxine Peake claimed the police who killed George Floyd in the US had learnt their techniques from the Israeli secret services.The decision infuriated the Left, but there was more to come, as Diane Abbott, and even his predecessor Mr Corbyn, lost the whip over comments he judged to be unacceptable.By January 2022, around three hundred members had been expelled by the party, often after complaints of anti-Semitism, and thousands of Mr Corbyn’s supporters had quit.Sir Keir had purged his party of its most toxic elements, and in doing so removed the biggest barrier to Labour being electable.Otherwise, he made an unimpressive start as Labour leader. A poor communicator, he was regularly duffed up at the despatch box by Boris Johnson, who loved to goad him with the nickname Captain Hindsight (later promoted to General Indecision).By May 2021, after Labour lost the Hartlepool by-election, questions were being asked about whether Sir Keir might be the first Labour leader since George Lansbury in 1935 to step down without fighting an election. As noted above, he certainly considered it, telling friends he saw it as a personal rejection and that people would see it as the party going backwards.Sir Keir’s job, at that stage, was simply to win back enough seats from the Conservatives to give the next leader a genuine crack at power. After all, no party in history had overturned the sort of majority won by Boris Johnson in 2019 in one single leap.Then came partygate, Liz Truss, and a collapse in support for the Tory Party that no one could have foreseen.It has left Sir Keir as the odds-on favourite to be the next prime minister. It appears he might get there simply by “getting the boring stuff right”."
Yahoo News UK,"Who is Richard Tice? Reform’s former leader turned Farage sidekickThe candidate for Hartlepool has seen his party's popularity swell in recent months, with one poll showing reform ahead of the Conservatives.",[],Andrew Naughtie,Updated 14 June 2024 at 6:45 am·6-min read,14,June,2024,06:45:00,6,"Now that Nigel Farage has taken over as the leader of Reform UK, Richard Tice’s public profile is fading fast - but the Reform chairman remains involved in the party's operations.So far, the party has only one MP, Conservative defector Lee Anderson. But a recent poll has shown Reform overtaking the Tories, raising the possibility Anderson could hold his seat and even end up with fellow Reformers in the next Parliament.As the candidate for Hartlepool, where he stood as the Brexit Party candidate in 2019, Tice hopes to be one of them. So who is he, and what does he stand for?Childhood and educationBorn in Surrey in 1964 to James Tice, a showjumper, and Joan Tice, a horse trainer. Educated at the private boarding school Uppingham, he studied at the University of Salford, gaining a degree in construction economics and quantity surveying – teeing him up for a career that he said would ""continue the family genes in the property industry"".Family (partner & kids)Tice has three children from a 24-year marriage that ended in divorce. He is now in a long-term relationship with the right-wing writer and journalist Isabel Oakeshott.She is perhaps best known for two notorious incidents that set her against leading Tories: a book that featured the heavily disputed allegation that David Cameron had engaged in sexual activity with a pig, and the release of embarrassing messages entrusted to her by Matt Hancock when she agreed to write a book with him.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election? Full list mappedThe key issues that will decide the electionWhen is the first UK general election TV debate?What is purdah? The strict rule that governs what politicians can and can't sayNet worthWhile not quite in the same league as Rishi Sunak, Tice is one of the wealthiest people in British politics. As he describes it on his website, he made his multi-million-pound fortune over the course of “30 years of making things happen in property investment”, starting with a graduate job at a London firm in 1987.According to Tice, the company he leads as CEO, Quidnet Capital, has “bought and managed £500 million in commercial properties across the UK on behalf of clients”.He was also a key figure in the redevelopment of London’s Nine Elms district, near Battersea Power Station, a controversial project that has transformed a stretch of the Thames’s south bank with a welter of rapidly erected high-rise blocks.GB News linksAlong with Nigel Farage, Lee Anderson and several MPs on the right flank of the Tory party, Tice is a regular on the hard-right, culture war-focused TV outlet GB News. There he hosts a programme called “Richard Tice’s Sunday Sermon”, which serves as a platform for him to deliver his political analysis without the interruptions of an interviewer.However, despite the network being a relatively safe space for him in ideological terms, Tice’s appearances aren’t always amicable. A recent interview with host Andrew Pierce, a longtime right-wing commentator, saw him challenged fiercely about Reform’s chances in a summer election should one be called – with Pierce pointing to the “weirdos” selected by the party to fight numerous seats as evidence the party is “not ready”.Richard Tice, pictured in 2018 at a 'Leave Means Leave' campaign event, is focused on the issue of immigration. (Steve Finn/WENN)Tice was also involved in an incident that saw the network deemed in breach of broadcasting regulator Ofcom’s impartiality regulations, specifically an interview in which a former Brexit Party MEP failed to “sufficiently challenge” his views on immigration.The regulator is under increasing pressure to crack down on GB News heading into the election, with critics arguing it cannot be allowed to broadcast shows that feature Tory and Reform MPs interviewing each other without alternative points of view represented.Tice on NHSThe state and future of the NHS set to be one of this election’s main battlegrounds, and Reform’s key health policy is to spend £17 billion on the NHS on top of its current budget in an effort to get waiting lists down to zero. It also proposes introducing tax relief on private healthcare – something that has been criticised by opponents as a creeping step towards the privatisation of healthcare writ large.Tice’s stated rationale is that the reason the service is struggling is because the money it needs is being spent on other things that the public do not in fact support. Top of the list is Net Zero, which the party and its predecessors have long decried as a pointless “woke” project.In April, Tice used a press conference to frame the choice starkly. “We have a choice in this country, it seems to me,” he said. “A pretty clear choice. Do we want zero waiting lists in two years, and to keep them there? That is the Reform choice. Or do we want net zero CO2 emissions in 25 years? That is the Labour choice.”Tice on immigrationImmigration is by far Reform UK’s top issue, with the party looking to build on Farage’s two decades of campaigning against it in its legal and illegal forms.As far as the election goes, Tice and the party are targeting the continuing arrival of small boats of people travelling across the English Channel, many of them seeking asylum. He has criticised the government for failing to stop “mass immigration” post-Brexit, and described Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda policy as “a disaster”, arguing on GB News that its supposed deterrent value was revealed to be zero just hours after the House of Commons finally passed the law.Reform chairman Richard Tice (L) and leader Nigel Farage speak at the party's economic policy launch at Church House in London. (Alamy Live News)“Within a matter of hours more boats, absolutely packed full, overfilled with illegal migrants, were setting off from the beaches. And we learnt on Tuesday morning that sadly five people, including a young child, drowned leaving the beaches. That's not a deterrent. That's an absolute disaster.”Instead of deporting people to Rwanda, he is arguing for a “pick up and take back” policy that would see small boat arrivals deposited back on French soil. As evidence that this is both practical and humane, he has cited similar policies deployed in the US and Australia.However, he has not addressed the fact that Australia’s policy has been criticised internationally for leaving so-called “boat people” confined to facilities on the island of Nauru, where there have been incidents of suicide and self-immolation.Tice on cost of living crisisPerhaps unsurprisingly given he is trying to peel away former Tory voters, Tice has criticised recent Tory prime ministers harshly for overseeing Britain’s intense cost of living crisis. In 2022, he accused then-prime minister Boris Johnson of “waffling” over the situation. “Clueless, out of touch, no ideas, no help,” he tweeted. “Shocking.”He has also warned that the prospect of a “disastrous” Labour government will offer no prospect of meaningful relief for struggling households.Instead, Reform proposes lifting the minimum level of income tax to £20,000 while cutting various other taxes – among them fuel duty, another gesture to the party’s rejection of environmentalism as a top priority."

In this next hour, the result for Rishi Sunak’s Richmond and Northallerton constituency is expected. A shock constituency-level poll for The Telegraph suggested he could become the first ever sitting Prime Minister to lose their seat at a general election, so all eyes will be on the count.Fifteen minutes later, Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, will find out how he has fared in Holborn and St Pancras, although his re-election in a safe Labour seat is expected to be more of a formality.The surge of Reform UK has been one of the major stories of this election. Party leader Nigel Farage will hope he has won a seat in the Commons at the eighth time of trying as the result comes in for Clacton, while Richard Tice, the Reform chairman, is hoping to unseat former Tory minister Matt Warman by the seaside in Boston and Skegness.Reform’s only current MP is Lee Anderson, a former deputy Tory chairman who crossed the floor in March following his suspension. He is hoping the former mining town of Ashfield, which traditionally opted for Labour but went Tory in 2019, will stick with him after his change of allegiances, as many Labour-turned-Tory voters now consider Reform.Shabana Mahmood and Jess Phillips, two Labour MPs in Birmingham, have faced a backlash from their voters over the party’s stance on Gaza, and the results in those constituencies will reveal how independent pro-Palestinian candidates have fared.How the Liberal Democrats have fared will be increasingly obvious from the results in North East Somerset and Hanham, currently held by Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, and Surrey Heath, which was Michael Gove’s seat before the Housing Secretary stood down shortly after Mr Sunak called the election.04:00: Aberafan Maesteg, Altrincham and Sale West,

HuffPost UK,'An Insidious Policy': Sky News Presenter Skewers James Cleverly Over Tory Tax Rises,[],Kevin Schofield,1 July 2024 at 2:56 am·1-min read,1,July,2024,02:56:00,1,"James Cleverly on Sky News this morning. Sky NewsA Sky News presenter this morning slammed James Cleverly over an “insidious” Tory policy which has saddled millions with higher tax bills.Matt Barbet took issue with the home secretary’s claim that the Conservatives are cutting taxes.He pointed out that the government’s decision to freeze salary thresholds - a process known as “fiscal drag” - has led to workers across the country paying more income tax.Cleverly admitted that taxes were “currently higher than we would like”, but blamed that on the cost of the pandemic and the spike in energy bills caused by the war in Ukraine.But Barbet said: “You’ve given with one hand in terms of the National Insurance cuts we’ve seen over the past few months, and taken more away with the other in terms of fiscal drag - more people being dragged into paying higher rates of income tax. That is an insidious policy, isn’t it?”The home secretary replied: “I’ve explained why taxes are currently higher than we would like because of those genuinely unique set of circumstances over the last couple of years.”Barbet also pointed out that corporation tax has gone up under the Tories, adding: “What does that do for business?”Cleverly said the Tories were “focusing on working people”.He added: “We’re determined to bring taxes down. We have started to do that and we have focused the initial work on those hardworking families who have struggled because of the war in Ukraine and Covid, and we are determined to do more.”Related...Desperate Rishi Sunak Goes Full Project Fear As Tories Brace For Election Wipeout'On The Brink Of Destruction': Trevor Phillips Tells Oliver Dowden The Tories Face Election WipeoutRishi Sunak Has Insisted He Is 'Proud' Of The Tories' Disastrous Election Campaign"

It is now looking ever-more likely that Sir Keir Starmer will be prime minister by next Friday.Nigel Farage may yet have a good election night as Reform UK are currently in third place in the polls. The polling for the party has slipped following the controversy over Farage’s comments about the war in Ukraine but the party is still some five percentage points ahead of the Lib Dems.There was even further grim reading for the Tories on 26 June, when a separate poll conducted by Ipsos for the Evening Standard claimed that a record seven out of 10 Britons do not like the Conservative Party.Yahoo News UK summaries the positions of the parties according to five separate opinion polls.No major changes show Labour on course for large victoryA poll by Savanta puts Labour on 42% – 21 points ahead of the Tories, who are on 21%. Ipsos also puts Labour on 42%, compared to 19% for the Tories, while JL Partners give similar results, with Labour on 41% and the Tories on 25%.A Verian poll shows Labour on 38%, with the Tories on 21%, while Survation show Labour on 41%, compared to a historic low of 18% for the Tories.An average of opinion polls from February to June this year. (PA)An average of all polls with survey work completed during the seven days to 26 June puts Labour on 41%, 21 points ahead of the Conservatives on 20%, followed by Reform on 16%, the Lib Dems on 11% and the Greens on 6% – unchanged on the figures for the previous week.On 22 May, the day Sunak called the election, the seven-day averages stood at Labour 45%, Conservatives 23%, Reform 11%, Lib Dems 9% and Greens 6%.Tories could slump to lowest number of seatsEarlier this month, three major polls showed the Tories were on course for a historic defeat, with one projection showing the party potentially slumping to the lowest number of seats since the party was formed.Using the multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP) technique, which enables projections to be made at constituency level, YouGov's polling for Sky News projected Labour being on course to achieve a 200-seat majority. The poll suggested Labour would secure 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.The YouGov poll for Sky News.A More In Common UK poll for the News Agents podcast showed Labour projecting to finish on 406 seats, with the Conservatives on 155.Meanwhile, polling by Savanta and Electoral Calculus for the Telegraph, showed Sunak could become the first sitting prime minister to lose his seat of Richmond and Northallerton to Labour. It put Labour on 516 seats, with the Tories on just 53.What are the latest odds?As of 26 June, Oddschecker – a website which compares odds across different bookmakers – had Labour at 1/41 to win the most seats. To put that in context, this is seen as so likely that a £10 bet would return just £10.24.The Conservatives are 80/1 to win the most seats, a scenario seen as so unlikely that a £10 punt would return £810.A Conservative majority government is also seen as so unlikely (125/1) that Oddschecker sees a Reform UK government as more likely (100/1).What went wrong for the Tories?YouGov's voting intention tracker between January 2020 and June 2024. (YouGov)So, why have the polls changed so dramatically? It's worth looking back on an extremely eventful four-and-a-half years in UK politics.According to YouGov's voting intention tracker (see chart, above), Tory support peaked at 53%, with Labour on 32%, in April 2020, months after the party's stunning success in the 2019 general election and Boris Johnson's pledge to “get Brexit done”. That month also saw Starmer take over as Labour leader from Jeremy Corbyn.This was also amid a spirit of national unity following the onset of the COVID pandemic which nearly killed Johnson himself. The then-PM had been released from hospital five days before this particular survey was taken.Boris Johnson delivers his final speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street in September 2022. (AFP via Getty Images)Over the rest of the year, there was a downturn in support amid chaos over COVID rules, with the Tories falling as low as 35% in November 2020, compared to Labour on 40%.However, the UK’s successful COVID vaccination programme provided a pathway out of lockdown and with it, improved poll ratings. Tory support peaked at 41% in June 2021, with Labour at 30%.In October that year, there was a sense Johnson was untouchable. At the Tory party conference, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg remarked how the PM was ""in total command of his party, and politically dominant in the country"".But this fell apart quickly with the Partygate scandal, which emerged in November that year. Time and again, reports emerged of government and Tory staff – including Johnson – having taken part in lockdown-era social gatherings when their own COVID rules had prohibited them.By January 2022, Tory support had plummeted to 28%, with Labour on 38%. Johnson struggled on, but never recovered and a wave of ministerial resignations forced him to resign in July that year.The UK had three separate prime ministers – Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak – between 6 September and 24 October, 2022. (Getty Images)His successor, Liz Truss, then embarked on arguably the most disastrous prime ministerial reign in history, characterised by the catastrophic ""mini-budget"", containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, which prompted an economic crisis. Like Johnson, she lost the confidence of Tory MPs – and voters – and had to resign.Her 49-day spell as PM was the shortest in history, with Tory support plummeting to 19% (with Labour on 56%) the day after she announced her resignation in October 2022.Rishi Sunak, who had lost to Truss in the previous month's Tory leadership election, took over. However, as the above YouGov chart indicates, he has failed to cut through with voters. Tory support was at 23% two days after he assumed office, with the most recent survey, carried out on Thursday, showing support is now lower than under Truss at 18%.In short, the polls and odds, not to mention other factors such as notable by-election victories for Starmer's Labour, are pointing to a Labour government next week.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

The party said this would amount to a total tax cut of £1,350 for the average worker on £35,000.It also reiterated its “long-term ambition” to scrap the “double tax on work” entirely when financial conditions allow.The manifesto also includes a pledge to abolish Stamp Duty on homes worth up to £425,000 for first-time buyers and to reintroduce the Help to Buy scheme.EconomyVow not to raise corporation taxEase burden of business rates for high street, leisure and hospitality firmsKeep the VAT threshold “under review”Return the size of the Civil Service to pre-pandemic levels to cut “government bureaucracy”Funnel civil service savings into defenceThe Tories said the “only way to give people peace of mind” that the UK can weather further global shocks is to “get borrowing and debt down”.Therefore, in the next Parliament, the party pledged to continue to meet its fiscal rules of having public sector net debt falling, and for public sector net borrowing to be below 3 per cent of GDP in the fifth year of the forecast.It said the measures in the manifesto are “fully funded” and “would result in lower borrowing in 2029-30”.The Conservatives promised to “always be the party of business”, with a vow not to raise corporation tax. They would also “continue to ease the burden of business rates” for high street, leisure and hospitality firms and keep the VAT threshold “under review”.Read the full 2024 Liberal Democrat manifesto hereMeanwhile, the party pledged to cut “government bureaucracy” by returning the size of the Civil Service to pre-pandemic levels, with the savings funnelled into defence spending.EnvironmentWater bosses to lose bonuses if their firm commits serious criminal breachInvest water company fines in river restoration projectsMore affordable housing for local people in rural areasEmpower councils to manage the growth of holiday letsExpand the UK’s Blue Belt marine conservation schemeNo new restrictions on fox huntingTo combat the sewage crisis blighting Britain’s waterways, the Tories would work with the regulator, Ofwat, to hold companies to account, including banning bonuses for bosses if their firm has committed a serious criminal breach. Proceeds from water companies fines would be used to invest in river restoration projects.The party would cut red tape that “holds back the planting of trees in the planning system”, identifying suitable areas where permits can be streamlined.It would maintain its “record flooding funding” of £5.6 billion over 2021-2027 and champion rural communities by backing farmers with a new legal target for food security.And it would “always stand up for farmers when negotiating new trade deals”.MrSunak said his party would back farmers with a new legal target for food security - Aaron Chown/PAThe Conservatives would boost the availability of affordable housing for local people in rural areas, while ensuring councils have the powers they need to manage “the uncontrolled growth of holiday lets”.Mr Sunak has also vowed not to introduce any new restrictions on fox hunting after Labour said it would ban all forms of hunting with hounds if he wins.Read the full 2024 Labour manifesto hereHe promised not to make any changes to the Hunting Act introduced by Sir Tony Blair in 2004, in a pitch to traditional Tory heartlands.The Tories would consult UK overseas territories on further expanding the Blue Belt programme, the UK’s flagship marine conservation scheme.And the party remains committed to banning the import of hunting trophies and tackling puppy smuggling and livestock worrying.Energy and net zeroCut consumers’ costs by taking a “more pragmatic approach” to the transitionLower green levies on household billsPut forward a vote in Parliament for any new net zero targetNo new green levies or frequent flyer chargeNorth Sea licensing rounds to continue annuallyTreble Britain’s offshore wind capacity and support solar energy “in the right places”The Tories’ central pledge on net zero is to cut the cost for consumers by taking a “more pragmatic approach” to the transition, with green levies on household bills lower in each year of the next Parliament than they were in 2023.The “next stage” of the roadmap would be put to a vote in Parliament, with any new target subject to “proper consideration of the plans and policies required”, in order to “maintain democratic consent for the big decisions that net zero will mean for our country”.The party would reform the Climate Change Committee, giving it an “explicit mandate to consider cost to households and UK energy security” in its future advice.It also ruled out creating any new green levies or a frequent flyer charge.North Sea licensing rounds would continue on an annual basis, in contrast to Labour’s policy. Meanwhile, the Tories would aim to treble Britain’s offshore wind capacity and support solar “in the right places” - crucially “not on our best agricultural land”.It also pledges to look at burying pylons underground and guaranteeing a parliamentary vote on the next stages of the “pathway” of net zero.Education and childcareBan mobile phones during the school dayEnsure parents see what their children are being taught in schoolsTransform post-16 education with new “Advanced British Standard”Create 100,000 apprenticeships by 2029New teachers in priority areas to get bonuses of up to £30k tax-free over five yearsThe Tories would ban mobile phones during the school day and ensure parents can see what their children are being taught, especially on “sensitive matters like sex education”.The party would aim to “transform” post-16 education by introducing a new Advanced British Standard, bringing together academic A-levels and technical T-levels.It has also pledged to create a further 100,000 apprenticeships by 2029, paid for by scrapping “poor quality” degrees.Both primary and secondary schools would be required to deliver two hours of PE every week. To boost recruitment, new teachers in priority areas and sought-after subjects would receive bonuses of up to £30,000 tax-free over five years from September 2024.The Prime Minister’s flagship campaign promise to bring back national service also features in the manifesto.Under the mandatory scheme, 18-year-olds would have to enrol in the military for a year or spend one weekend each month volunteering in their community.DefenceBring back national service for school leaversIncrease military budget to 2.5 per cent of GDP by end of the decade£3 billion in support every year for Ukraine until 2030Introduce a Veterans’ Bill that gives employers tax breaks for hiring themIn his first major policy announcement of the election campaign, Mr Sunak vowed to bring back national service for school leavers, which would open military placements to 30,000 youngsters with residential stays at army barracks or other military facilities.The Conservatives hope the policy will set them apart from Labour as they seek to present themselves as the only party that can be trusted with the UK’s security and defence with multiple threats facing Britain and the world.Mr Sunak warned in a speech in May that a Labour victory represented a threat to UK security.The Prime Minister announced his party would hike the military budget to 2.5 per cent of GDP by the end of the decade - a commitment Labour has failed to match.He also committed to at least £3 billion in support every year for Ukraine until 2030, with both pledges reinforced in the election manifesto.In a major speech at the Policy Exchange think tank on May 13, Mr Sunak argued that Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, would be emboldened by Labour not matching his promise to raise defence spending to 2.5 per cent by 2030.It comes with concerns having been raised about the size of the Army, Navy and Air Force and their struggle to attract enough new recruits.In a tribute to Armed Forces personnel, Mr Sunak will also introduce a Veterans’ Bill to give employers tax breaks for hiring “heroes who have put their lives on the line” and cut the price of rail travel for them.Elsewhere, the Tories pledged to declare China a risk to UK security on a par with Russia and Iran if they win the election.They have committed to adding China to the “enhanced tier” of the UK’s foreign influence registration scheme, meaning all Chinese individuals acting on behalf of the nation would face heightened scrutiny.Pensions and welfare“Quadruple lock” state pension that will never be taxedKeep winter fuel payments, free TV licences and bus passes for pensionersCrackdown on Britain’s welfare billOverhaul sick notes to get more people back into workTougher sanctions for those able to seek work but choose not toMr Sunak declared on May 27 that the state pension will never be taxed under the Conservatives as he unveiled a so-called quadruple lock.The manifesto also promises to keep all other pensioner perks including winter fuel payments, free TV licences and bus passes in place.It adds: “We are carefully considering the Ombudsman report into WASPI women and will work with Parliament to provide an appropriate and swift response.”At the same time it takes a completely different approach when it comes to benefits, with a crackdown on Britain’s ballooning welfare bill set out.The manifesto includes an overhaul of sick notes to get more people back into work and tougher sanctions for those who are able to seek work but choose not to.Policing and crimeTougher sentencing for knife crimeBuild four new jails by 2030, providing 20,000 extra prison placesRecruit an extra 8,000 police officersNew mandatory 25-year sentences for domestic abuse murdersNew police powers to ban protests that pose a risk of serious disorderBan protests outside schoolsThe election campaign will see Mr Sunak and Sir Keir battle it out for who can sound the toughest when it comes to cracking down on crime.Labour has banged the drum on lower-level offences like burglary and antisocial behaviour, painting a picture of a lawless Britain where neighbourhoods live in fear.The Prime Minister has come under pressure to match that rhetoric with harsher sentences for petty criminals and more community payback schemes.His manifesto includes a crackdown on knife crime with tougher sentencing, allowing the Tories to target Sadiq Khan’s record in London.The Tories also pledge to build four new jails by 2030, providing 20,000 extra prison places so that more criminals can be locked up for longer.The dossier also includes a commitment to recruit an extra 8,000 police officers dedicated specifically to tackling neighbourhood crime in a £650 million plan that would take the total number of officers in the UK to its highest level ever at 180,000.And it states that the Tories will “toughen up community sentencing by increasing the use of community payback and electronic tagging, so criminals pay their debt to society and communities witness justice being served”.Elsewhere it contains new mandatory 25-year sentences for domestic abuse murders and commits to a wider review of homicide sentencing which could lead to the creation of US-style first and second-degree murder, increasing the minimum sentence for murders in the home from 15 to 25 years.Find out how Reform UK’s full manifesto comparesThe manifesto also says police will get new powers to ban protests or marches that pose a risk of serious disorder. Chief constables would be able to block marches due to the “cumulative” disruption and “persistent” threats to public order. Police could also be able to recover the costs of policing protests from groups that organised them.Protests outside schools would also be banned to “stop mobs from intimidating teachers and children”. Teachers would be given legal protection from blasphemy accusations following cases such as the Batley school cartoon row where a teacher was forced into hiding.Police and prosecutors would be placed under a new legal duty to publish regular guidance on the statements, chants or symbols, such as the swastika or the term “jihad”, that in the context of political protest may constitute an offence.MigrationBring in a “binding, legal” annual cap on immigrationAnnual vote in Parliament on the visa cap figureLegal migrants must undergo a health check before getting a visaRaise skilled workers’ salary requirements in line with inflation each yearRemove illegal migrants to Rwanda, with monthly flights, starting in July, until the boats are stoppedSign further returns deals similar to the agreement with AlbaniaMr Sunak has been under huge pressure from his own MPs to go into the next election on a cast-iron promise to dramatically cut net migration.The manifesto includes a commitment to bring in a “binding, legal” annual cap on immigration visas but does not say at what number it would be set.Instead Parliament would get an annual vote on the visa cap figure, which would be recommended by the Government’s migration advisers.Legal migrants would be required to undergo a health check before getting a visa as part of a plan to reduce the cost to the NHS of those arriving with conditions.The manifesto also includes a commitment to raise the salary requirements for skilled workers in line with inflation every year “to make sure they don’t undercut UK workers”.On stopping the small boats, it says: “We will run a relentless, continual process of permanently removing illegal migrants to Rwanda with a regular rhythm of flights every month, starting this July, until the boats are stopped.”The manifesto also commits the Government to “sign further returns deals like the one we have already agreed with Albania”.It also says the party will work with other countries to “rewrite” asylum treaties to make them fit for the “challenges” of illegal migration.But it stops short of pledging a referendum on leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, as demanded by some Tory MPs.Instead it only opens the door to the possibility of leaving the convention by vowing to put the security of UK borders ahead of membership of a foreign court.Levelling-upGive 30 towns across UK £20 million eachCreate more freeports and continue backing investment zonesRevitalise high streets by changing planning lawsMake chewing gum manufacturers pay for street cleaningMr Sunak has pledged to give 30 towns across the UK £20 million each in an expansion of the party’s levelling-up policy.The Prime Minister claimed the methodology used to select the towns – including Tamworth, Bognor Regis, Flint, Perth and Newry – had been used “multiple times before” based on “levelling-up needs, looking at economic opportunity, skills, health and life expectancy”.He claimed towns were “neglected” under a previous Labour government and added: “I’m not going to make any apology for supporting towns.“Crucially, it will be local people in all those areas that are in charge of how to spend that money, to make sure it’s spent and invested on their priorities - an example of us levelling up everywhere, backing local people and their priorities, and giving them the long-term funding and assurance to do so,” he said.The manifesto also includes pledges to create more freeports, where businesses get tax breaks for investing, and to continue backing investment zones.Elsewhere it features a commitment to revitalise high streets by changing planning laws and making chewing gum manufacturers pay for street cleaning.“We will change planning laws to support places to bring back local market days and regenerate defunct shopping centres,” it says."

Yahoo News UK,Who is Ed Davey? Lib Dem leader attracts attention with election stuntsEverything you need to know about the former minister who has pledged to fight for the NHS.,"['His early life', 'His family', 'His parents', 'His education', 'Why is he a Sir?', 'Davey on... the cost of living crisis', 'Davey on... the NHS', 'Davey on... immigration', 'Davey on... the Post Office scandal']",Hannah Fearn,7 June 2024 at 11:47 am·6-min read,7,June,2024,11:47:00,6,"Ed Davey has been involved in a number of comedy stunts since the election was called. (Alamy)With the spotlight on prime minister Rishi Sunak and Labour leader Keir Starmer as they prepare to slug it out in a general election campaign, the focus had started slipping from Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey until a series of stunts put him back in the spotlight.The former coalition government cabinet minister – who lost his seat, punished by voters for getting into bed with the Tories, but then won it back again – is sending a clear message that he should not be overlooked.He’s had a long political career and the climax may still be ahead: if polls continue to shift away from the Conservatives at the current trajectory, there’s a slim possibility that, if the election is held in October, he could end up as leader of the opposition.So what do we know about the man behind the third party in British politics? Hannah Fearn finds out.His early lifeEd Davey was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on Christmas Day in 1965. He was the youngest of three boys, but lost his father at just four years old and then his mother when he was in his mid-teens. She had spent three years battling cancer, during which time he nursed his mother together with his grandmother and brother Henry.Once a keen Scout and Air Scout, he later remembers feeling “isolated” at school because of his caring responsibilities, which meant he couldn’t take part in after-school activities or sports. “The last 18 months she was bedridden and in a lot of pain. I’d spend hours on the bed, talking to her,” he said. Davey was with his mother when she died at Nottingham General Hospital, after being placed on an unsuited dementia ward.After both his parents had died, Davey was brought up by his maternal grandparents in the village of Eakring, though his grandfather died soon after. He spent much of his childhood and young adulthood close to his grandmother. “First of all, she was looking after me. Then we were looking after each other,” he said.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

The strict rule that governs what politicians can and can't sayHis familyDavey married Emily Gasson, a former Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate who unsuccessfully stood in four elections and is now a councillor, in 2005 and the pair have two children, a son and daughter.Their son, born in 2007 and now a teenager, is disabled with a neurological condition. He has attended special schools but is now educated at home with a tutor – a change that Davey said led to him becoming verbal for the first time. He has spoken about his anxiety about who will care for his son when he and his wife are no longer around. “It’s the thing that worries me more than anything else in my life,” Davey said.Gasson was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in 2012. She was well for many years following her diagnosis, but declined during lockdown and is working on recovering her physical strength.Liberal Democrats election broadcast shows Ed Davey with his son. (Liberal Democrats)His parentsHis father, John, was a solicitor and his mother, Nina, a teacher. Davey has described how he was inspired to study by his mother, who always wanted him to try hard academically and who he wanted to impress.His educationDavey attended the private Nottingham High School, the alma mater of former chancellor Kenneth Clarke. He became head boy, with Labour MP Ed Balls – who was studying in the year below – watching on.After school, he achieved a first class degree in philosophy, politics and economics at Jesus College, Oxford where he was junior common room president. After becoming an economics researcher for the Liberal Democrats he returned to study, reading for a master’s degree in economics at Birkbeck College, London.Ed Davey, pictured with his family. (Liberal Democrats)Why is he a Sir?For three years, the Lib Dem leader was a member of the cabinet in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition government, holding the post of secretary of state for energy and climate change from 2012 to 2015. He was knighted in the 2016 New Year’s Honours for “political and public services”.Davey on... the cost of living crisisDavey has repeatedly attacked the government for failing to curb rapid inflation and the devastating effect it is having on household budgets. He called the Conservative Party “so out of touch they might as well be living on another planet”, and said he warned Jeremy Hunt “people are desperate for real help… but all the chancellor could offer is empty words and unfair tax hikes”.In particular, he has urged more action on food price inflation, which analysis from his own party found had risen 37% in one year for the average weekly supermarket trip. He has promised to end energy hikes and abandoned his plan to add 1p to income tax to save the NHS because ordinary voters can no longer afford it.Davey on... the NHSThe Liberal Democrats have made the NHS a cornerstone of their policy platform for the last five years. In Davey’s words: “Voting Conservative is bad for your health.” He promises to reverse cuts to GP numbers and guarantee a doctor’s appointment when you need one, improve access to NHS dentistry and save lives by tackling ambulance call out delays.Davey blames the care crisis for deepening the problems of the health service and says his party would spend £5bn a year on a “care package” to ensure patients are discharged from hospital more quickly, freeing up bed space. However, there is little detail on how this would be financed without raising taxes on the wealthiest - which Davey has promised not to do in his push to poach disillusioned Tory voters.Sir Ed Davey was a member of the Tory-Lib Dem government. (Reuters)Davey on... immigrationThe Lib Dem leader has been a long-standing advocate for refugee rights and critic of the government’s immigration policy. Davey has called for Conservative plans to deport failed asylum seekers to Rwanda a “cynical distraction” from the Partygate crisis and the money would be better spent on measures to tackle the cost of living crisis. He added: “They’ve provided no evidence to suggest that this new policy will stop illegal smuggling, they’re not cracking down on the organised crime gangs, which is what you need to do.”Davey has called for a new right to work for refugees and asylum seekers, and major reform of the Home Office, which he says is no longer up to the job. After the end of the coalition government in 2015, Davey has said his party “was wrong” to go along with the introduction of a minimum income standard for immigrants. He later described the policy as “nasty and unfair”.Davey on... the Post Office scandalDespite the Post Office scandal that led to the wrongful prosecution of more than 700 subpostmasters crossing the tenure of more than a dozen business secretaries, Davey has recently taken the heat for failing to investigate the issue while he was in the job.It has emerged that while a minister, Davey initially rejected a request to meet justice campaigner Alan Bates, and later accepted it only on the advice that it would be good for his PR. He has recently apologised for not acting earlier, admitting that he is sorry that he “did not see through Post Office lies” about the fault in the Horizon programme."
Yahoo News UK,The Tory ministers and 'big beasts' who could lose MP seats in the electionSeveral big names in the Conservative Party are at risk of losing their seats in the general election.,"['Grant Shapps', 'Penny Mordaunt', 'Liz Truss', 'Jacob Rees-Mogg', 'Johnny Mercer', 'Victoria Prentis', 'Alex Chalk', 'David TC Davies']",Andy Wells,Updated 20 June 2024 at 0:51 am·5-min read,20,June,2024,00:51:00,5,"Rishi Sunak could become the first prime minister to lose his seat in a general election, according to new bombshell polling.According to the Savanta poll, which was commissioned by The Telegraph, the Conservatives are projected to win just 53 seats in the general election. Some three-quarters of the Cabinet would lose their seats in that scenario – including Sunak.Were Sunak to lose his seat in Richmond (Yorks), it would make him the first prime minister in history to lose their seat in a general election, according to the Institute for Government. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is also facing a battle to hold on to his constituency, with the vote on a “knife edge”.Savanta spoke to around 18,000 people between 7 June and 18 June for their poll. If reflected in the election, Labour would be on course to win 516 seats, with a commanding Commons majority of 382. The Liberal Democrats would have nearly as many seats (50) as the Tories.Jeremy Hunt: My constituency is on a knife edgeHunt could be among the Conservative casualties on the night of the 4 July poll, despite his newly-created seat in Godalming and Ash currently holding a Conservative majority of more than 10,000. He is facing a battle to win the seat in Surrey, with the Liberal Democrats keen on taking a high-profile scalp.Several other Tory ‘big beasts’ also face a tight vote to hold onto their seat, according to a major poll by Ipsos.Grant ShappsDefence secretary Grant Shapps may lose his seat in the election.

(PA)Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons, is another Tory MP whose name has been mentioned in a future leadership contest – in the event of the Tories losing the election. However, she may not even be an MP after 4 July as her Portsmouth North seat is at risk.Seen as “leaning Labour”, polling suggests Labour are on 42%, compared to the Tories on 34%. She won 61.4% of the vote in the 2019 election.Liz TrussFormer prime minister Liz Truss may not be an MP after the election. (PA)Former prime minister Liz Truss is at risk in her South West Norfolk seat. The seat is seen as a “toss up”, with Truss currently in the lead at 31%. Labour are a sitting at 27% but Reform UK are polling 30%.Allowing for margins of error and another two weeks of campaigning, the seat will be hotly contested between all three parties on 4 July.Jacob Rees-MoggJacob Rees-Mogg is on track to lose his seat at the general election. (PA)While no longer a government minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg losing his North East Somerset and Hanham seat would perhaps be one of the night’s bigger surprises. Rees-Mogg has been an outspoken critic of some of Sunak’s policies and is a regular presenter on GB News.However, the Ipsos poll has the seat, which has been newly-created for the 2024 election, is currently showing a “likely Labour” win, with the party on 47%, compared to 30% for the Conservatives.Johnny MercerPolling suggests Johnny Mercer will lose his seat to Labour at the election.

The Independent,Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party take the lead in first round of French election voting,[],Holly Evans and Tom Watling,1 July 2024 at 2:54 am·3-min read,1,July,2024,02:54:00,3,"Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally (RN) has taken a strong lead in France’s first round of parliamentary elections, following an unusually high turnout among voters. Official results showed that the nationalist leader’s party won 33 per cent of the vote, while current president Emmanuel Macron’s Together coalition slumped to third place on 20 per cent. Leftwing party New Popular Front (NFP) scored around 28 per cent.Speaking at an election party in the northern town of Henin Beaumont, Ms Le Pen said: “Democracy has spoken, and the French people have placed the National Rally and its allies in first place – and has practically wiped out the Macronist bloc. Nothing has been won – and the second round will be decisive.”Le Pen is at the ‘gates of power’ following first round success (AP)The elections were called just three weeks ago after Mr Macron’s party suffered heavy defeats in the European parliament election earlier in June by the National Rally, which has historic ties to racism and antisemitism and is hostile toward France’s Muslim community.Mr Macron, in a written statement, called for a “broad” democratic alliance against the far-right and said that the high voter turnout spoke of “the importance of this vote for all our compatriots and the desire to clarify the political situation”.His party said their candidates would drop out in areas where they had come third place in favour of contenders “in a position to beat the RN and with whome we share the essential: the values of the republic”.Jean Luc-Melenchon, leader of the far-left party La France Insoumise (LFI), a part of the NFP, called for all leftwing candidates tipped to come third to do the same and bow out of the race.Meanwhile, Ms Le Pen said that an “absolute majority” at parliament would enable the far right to form a new government with party president Jordan Bardella as prime minister in order prioritise France’s “recovery”.Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte cast their votes on Sunday (Getty)Projections by polling agencies suggest the National Rally stands a good chance of winning a majority in the lower house of parliament for the first time, with an estimated one-third of the first-round vote, nearly double their 18 per cent in the first round in 2022.Their success now leaves open huge questions on how Mr Macron will share power with a prime minister who is hostile to most of his policies.The two-round elections that wrap up on 7 July could impact European financial markets, Western support for Ukraine and the management of France’s nuclear arsenal and global military force.However, many French voters are frustrated about inflation and other economic concerns, as well as Mr Macron’s leadership, seen as arrogant and out-of-touch.Ms Le Pen‘s anti-immigration National Rally party has tapped that discontent, notably via online platforms like TikTok, and led in pre-election opinion polls.The far-right leader said her party had ‘practically wiped out’ Macron’s centrist coalition (Reuters)A new coalition on the left, the New Popular Front, also poses a challenge to the pro-business Mr Macron and his centrist alliance Together for the Republic.His election call was a gamble that French voters who were complacent about the European election would be jolted into turning out for moderate forces in national elections to keep the far right out of power. Instead, pre-election polls suggested the National Rally had a chance at winning a parliamentary majority.In that scenario, Mr Macron would be expected to name 28-year-old Mr Bardella as prime minister in an awkward power-sharing system known as “cohabitation”.It would then be his job to manage foreign policy and act as chief of the armed forces while Mr Bardella would run domestic affairs and set the budget.While Mr Macron has said he will not step down before his presidential term expires in 2027, cohabitation would weaken him at home and on the world stage."

In the case of the 2024 election in the UK, parliament was dissolved on the 30 May and the election will take place on 4 July.CanvassingGoing round a particular area trying to persuade people to vote for one party or the other.In UK elections, this is often done by volunteers knocking on people’s doors.Capital gains taxCapital gains tax is a tax on profit when people sell assets that have increased in value.In the 2024 election, the Conservatives have promised that landlords who sell to sitting tenants will be spared capital gains tax on the proceeds, while Labour has left the door open to raising capital gains.Child benefitChild benefit is a benefit paid to parents with children under 16 (or under 20 in approved education or training).The Conservatives have promised to increase the threshold at which high earners start to lose the benefit from £60,000 to £120,000.Sir Keir Starmer, like the Conservatives, has pledged not to raise VAT. (Photo by Stefan Rousseau/PA Images via Getty Images)CoalitionA coalition government is a government formed jointly by more than one political party (for example, by the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives in 2010).ConstituencyThe geographical area that is represented by each MP in the House of Commons.ECHRThe European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is an international convention which protects human rights in Europe.The Conservative manifesto stopped short of promising to withdraw from the ECHR, which would have made plans such as the plan to deport migrants to Rwanda easier.Exit pollA poll conducted outside polling stations just after people have voted on election day.On election day, the results of Britain’s exit poll are published just after polls close at 10pm and tend to give a more accurate prediction of the result than previous polls produced throughout the campaign.First past the postThe first past the post system is used to elect MPs to the House of Commons.The candidate with the most votes in each constituency becomes MP, and the party with the most MPs becomes the government.This can mean that the winning party actually has a minority of votes cast: in 2019, the Conservatives had 43.6% of the vote.Hung parliamentA hung parliament is where no party has enough seats to form an overall majority. For example, both the 2010 election and 2017 elections resulted in hung parliament.In 2010, the Conservatives formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, while in 2017, the Conservatives formed a minority government with a 'confidence and supply' agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).Income tax thresholdThe thresholds between the tax-free allowance, basic rate tax and higher rates of tax.Both parties have said they will continue the freeze on income tax thresholds brought in under the Conservatives, which means people pay more tax as more and more people are pushed into higher tax brackets if wages rise.MajorityA party with a majority – more than half of the seats in the House of Commons – has won the election.The number of votes by which an individual MP wins a constituency is also referred to as their majority.ManifestoPolitical parties publish manifestos before a general election, with a set of policies that the party stands for and aims to implement if elected.Manifesto pledges are not legally binding.Marginal seatA seat in which the incumbent MP won by a small majority, meaning a swing is more likely than in a so-called ‘safe seat’ where the MP had a large majority.Net zeroThe UK Government has set a goal for Britain’s emissions to reach net zero – where emission and removal of greenhouse gases reaches equilibrium – by 2050.All major parties are expected to stick to this goal, barring Reform UK.Opinion pollAn opinion poll is a research survey (usually carried out on a representative sample of the electorate) to gauge likely results in an election.Poll‘The polls’ refers to the places where people vote in an election: exit polls and opinion polls refer to two kinds of survey used to predict election results.Postal voteAn absentee vote where the vote is sent in by post.At the 2019 general election, 17.2% of voters across the UK used a postal ballot.Proxy voteA vote where a person who can’t make it to the booth appoints someone to vote for them.In the 2019 election, 0.6% of voters appointed a proxy.PsephologyPsephology is the scientific study of elections and voting and is used to predict and analyse election results.Polling dayThe day when the country places their vote: in the UK 2024 election, this is July 4.PurdahBefore British elections, the country enters purdah, officially known as the ‘pre-election period of sensitivity’.Purdah means that politicians (both local and national) and other people such as civil servants face restrictions on what they can do and announce.Ministers who remain in office can’t announce new funding, or new policies, or anything which might sway voters or make the government more popular.The idea is that public money cannot be spent on the election.Spoiled ballotA ballot paper which has been marked wrongly (for instance with a vote for more than one candidate) will not be counted.Sometimes people spoil ballots deliberately as a protest vote to show dissatisfactionSwing‘Swing’ is the change in voter support for a political party between one election and the next.It is used to analyse the performance of parties in different areas.Tax burdenThe tax burden refers to the total amount of taxes paid by a group (in this case the UK as a whole) as a proportion of total income.The tax burden is currently at its highest in 70 years according to the OECD.The Equality ActThe 2010 Equality Act protects people against discrimination in Britain.The Conservatives want to ‘tweak’ the Act so that sex-based protections only apply on the basis of someone’s biological sex.Triple lockThe triple lock is a guarantee introduced to the state pension in 2010 so it would not lose value in real terms.The guarantee means that the state pension will rise by the highest out of average earnings, inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) or 2.5%.Triple lock plusThe ‘triple lock plus’ is a Conservative policy, which would see the tax-free pension allowance rise every year in line with the triple lock of average wages, inflation, or 2.5% – whichever is highest, to prevent pensioners being pulled into paying income tax.TurnoutTurnout refers to the percentage of people eligible to vote who turn out to vote on election day.In the 2019 election, for example, 67.3% of those eligible turned out to vote.VATValue added tax is added to goods and services sold by VAT-registered companies, and is the third-largest source of government income after income tax and national insurance.Both Labour and the Conservatives have pledged not to raise VAT.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

Herald Scotland,French far-right 'at the gates of power' as Emmanuel Macron's election gambit fails,[],Gabriel McKay,1 July 2024 at 4:45 am·4-min read,1,July,2024,04:45:00,4,"One of France's biggest newspapers has warned ""the far-right is at the gates of power"" after Marine Le Pen's Rassemblement National (RN, National Rally) took a third of the vote in parliamentary elections.President Emmanuel Macron called a snap election in the wake of the European Parliament elections in June which saw his party, Renaissance, and its coalition make significant losses.However, that gamble appears to have backfired after RN won 33.1% of the vote in the first round of elections, beating the left-wing alliance, Nouveau Front Populaire (NFP, New Popular Front), which returned 28%.Mr Macron's coalition, Ensemble, managed just 21%.At 66.7% the turnout was the highest for any parliamentary first round election since 1997, with over 10m voting for RN, which took 37 seats while the Union of the Far-Right took one.The NFP managed 32 seats in the first round of voting with just two for Mr Macron's coalition.A total of 76 candidates were elected in the first round, with the remaining 501 going to a run-off which will be held on Sunday.""The far-right is at the gates of power,"" warned Le Monde. ""The political world is torn apart over which position to take in the face of a risk which has become very tangible.""The sign reads to the polls, citizens, a play on to arms citizens from the French national anthem (Image: Le Monde)Mr Macron said: ""Faced with the Rassemblement National, the time has come for a broad coalition which is clearly democratic and republican for the second round.""The high first round turnout testifies to the importance of this vote for all our compatriots and the desire to clarify the political situation.""It is not clear whether the president will instruct candidates from his movement to drop out of three-way races to allow the left-wing coalition to win.Read More:Jordan Bardella and how the march of the right has reached young French votersThe rise of Gabriel Attal, Emmanuel Macron devotee and France's new Prime MinisterUkraine could still be biggest loser from three big Western electionsHe has described elements of the NFP, in particular Jean-Luc Mélenchon's La France Insoumise (France Unbowed) as ""grotesque"" and destructive for France.Candidates who have qualified for the second round have until Tuesday evening to decide whether or not to drop out.Ms Le Pen's party would need to secure 289 seats to attain a majority and form a government, having previously stated they would only do so with a majority.According to Ipsos, the vote share attained by RN would see them fall just short, with a projected seat total of 230-280, but much will depend on how the other parties react.In up to 315 constituencies there is a three-way race between RN, NFP and Ensemble, with pressure on Mr Macron's coalition to drop out in races where its candidates finished third in the first round of voting.Mr Mélenchon said the NFP would withdraw all candidates who came third in the first round, saying: ""Our guideline is simple and clear: not one single more vote for the Rassemblement National.Après le choc : FAIRE BLOC. C'est la une de @Libe lundi.#Législatives2024 pic.twitter.com/kHCrqfEKAw— Libération (@libe) June 30, 2024Newspaper Libération called on the other parties to unite to defeat the right, its front page reading: ""After the shock, form the bloc"".In its editorial it wrote: ""The RN is now at the gates of power, the united left resisted. Macron is on the ground and only a republican roadblock can avoid the worst.""Jordan Bardella, who will be Prime Minister if RN wins an absolute majority, responded to the results with an open letter to the French people.La France est à l’heure des choix.

A victory for this coalition, which wants to open wide the gates of immigration and release 20% of prisoners, would signify for France a new regression in public order, an unprecedented curbing of our freedoms and the community values we hold so dear."""

They are going to scrap the Rwanda scheme, they’ve said they’re going to do that even if it’s working.”He added: “The only intervention recently that Keir Starmer has had on this is this weird dog whistle attack on the Bangladeshi community where he’s claiming that that we are not returning people to Bangladesh which was, A, not true and, B, not relevant, because the Bangladeshi community make a tiny, tiny, tiny, less than a half a percent of small boat arrivals.”Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is favourite to become prime minister after Thursday’s election (Stefan Rousseau/PA) (PA Wire)Ashworth denies Putin happy to see Labour win08:05 , Salma OuaguiraShadow paymaster general Jonathan Ashworth has denied Vladimir Putin would rather see Labour win over the Conservatives.When asked about comments made by Rishi Sunak on Sunday, Mr Ashworth told Times Radio: “No of course not.

They’ve done it to themselves. They’ve broken trust.“The Conservatives have not delivered Brexit, 5.5 million men and women out there running small businesses feel totally betrayed.

We had Covid which hit the global economy and of course the UK economy incredibly hard. The Prime Minister, when he was chancellor, put in place the most comprehensive and generous support package this country has ever seen, with the furlough scheme.”Pressed on tax rises under the Conservatives, Mr Cleverly said: “The reason that taxes have had to go up is we had to pay for furlough, we had to pay for energy support and the question now is what happened next. Independent predictions say under Labour the tax burden is the highest it has ever been.“Under the Conservatives we have already started bringing taxes down, we’ve committed to abolishing National Insurance. So that’s the choice we’ve got ahead.” (Sky News)Labour: It’s ‘squeaky bum time’ for party07:23 , Salma OuaguiraShadow secretary Jonathan Ashworth has faced questions on whether Labour is prepared for the pay demands the party is likely to face.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “Well, first of all we’ve got to win an election on Thursday and this is the period now where your co-presenter who is a Manchester United fan would know that Alex Ferguson described as ‘squeaky bum time’.“There are still people who are making their minds up, still working out what to do.

alongside many decent, honest and hardworking people during the course of the General Election campaign in Erewash, the reports of widespread racism and sexism in Reform have made clear that there is a significant moral issue within certain elements of the party, and the failure of the party’s leadership to not only take this matter seriously, but also to fundamentally address it, has made clear to me that this is no longer a party I want to be associated with.”“As a result, I am announcing my endorsement of the Conservative Party candidate, Maggie Throup, for Erewash.

It’s an oddity of our system.

I was told they were a broad church. Well they’re a broad church without any religion.“It simply doesn’t work. So we will again renew our campaign with added vigour to say that the state broadcaster has abused its position of power and we will campaign for the abolition of the BBC licence fee.”Farage claims Reform canvasser comments were ‘smear campaign’ effortsSunday 30 June 2024 14:09 , Maryam Zakir-HussainNigel Farage claimed the comments made by a Reform UK canvasser were part of a “smear campaign” against the party as he said the “bad apples are gone” and “we’ll never have them back”.The party leader said Andrew Parker’s remarks had been “used as the biggest smear against us”.He told the rally: “Look, Reform is a new organisation. It’s a start-up and there were requests put out for candidates to stand.“Have we had a few bad apples? We have, although to my knowledge nobody involved in an organised betting ring is standing for us, which is something.”He added: “I have to say, the bad apples are gone.

Nigel Farage has just described these comments as ‘inappropriate’.“They’re not inappropriate. They were vile and racist and wrong, but he’s only said that they’re inappropriate.“The person who made them has only apologised to the Reform Party for the impact it’s had on them.

That’s completely and utterly wrong.”Mr Sunak cited Britain building new nuclear submarines with Australia and the United States, and the negotiation of the Windsor Framework with the EU and support for Ukraine.He claimed that “people are queuing up to work with us because they respect what we do”.“So I just completely reject that, it’s entirely wrong, this kind of declinist narrative that people have of the UK I wholeheartedly reject.”PM confronted by viewers’ questionsSunday 30 June 2024 10:08 , Maryam Zakir-HussainRishi Sunak was told viewers want to “stick to the policies of the person who is sitting in the chair” after he accused Labour of planning to reaccept EU laws when asked about Brexit.During questions on trade negotiations since leaving the European Union, he told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme: “You haven’t mentioned we’re the first European nation to join the CPTPP trade deal.“We were negotiating very closely with India and I’m confident that we will be the first European country, again under a Conservative government if we’re re-elected, to negotiate the trade deal that steep with India, which again is one of the fastest growing parts of the world... I don’t think it’s right for Labour to end up re-accepting EU rules that we have no say over.”Ms Kuenssberg said: “I’ll remind you, as I have every politician in the last six weeks, that our viewers want us to stick to the party’s policies of the person who is sitting in the chair, with respect.”Rishi Sunak says he is 'proud' of his election campaignSunday 30 June 2024 09:58 , Maryam Zakir-HussainRishi Sunak has said he is ‘proud’ of his election campaign.“This campaign is something I am very proud of,” he told the BBC.It comes after he left D-Day commemorations early and his party became embroiled in a gambling scandal.PM: ‘Investing in defence shows we have strength’Sunday 30 June 2024 09:51 , Maryam Zakir-HussainRishi Sunak said investing in defence shows the UK’s adversaries that “we have strength” as he added “the world is dangerous”.When challenged about his plan to cut civil servants to fund this increase in spending, he said: “We’ve had a massive expansion of civil servants since the pandemic to deal with it, it was reasonable at the time, but it’s no longer reasonable.”Sunak: ‘UK is better place to live now than when Tories first came into office’Sunday 30 June 2024 09:42 , Maryam Zakir-HussainRishi Sunak said the UK is a better place to live in now than it was when the Tories took office in 2010.The Prime Minister told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg: “It’s a better place to live than it was in 2010.“Of course I understand that the last few years have been difficult for everyone.He cited the pandemic and the war in Ukraine driving up energy bills, insisting “we are now on the right track”.It was put to him that the country has become poorer by many measures since 2010, and public services are worse.“I just don’t accept that,” Mr Sunak replied, citing education and saying “our schoolchildren are now the best readers in the western world”."
Yahoo News UK,"3 electoral maps that show how disastrous the election could be for the ToriesWith new modelling predicting a Labour victory even bigger than Tony Blair's 1997 landslide, the outlook for Rishi Sunak is not looking good.",['Which Tory ministers are at risk of losing their seats?'],James Cheng-Morris and  James Hockaday,Updated 5 June 2024 at 8:34 am·4-min read,5,June,2024,08:34:00,4,"The outlook was already looking bleak for the Conservative Party when Rishi Sunak called the general election following months of dismal approval ratings that showed little sign of improving.At a campaign event last week, Sunak said he didn't think defeat to Labour was a ""foregone conclusion"", suggesting his main election rival Sir Keir Starmer was taking the British electorate ""for granted"".However, a general election projection released on Monday will have added to the Tories' woes – predicting the biggest win for Labour in the party's history, surpassing even that of Tony Blair's 1997 landslide.The analysis, carried out by YouGov for Sky News, used a relatively new polling technique called Multi-level Regression and Post-stratification (MRP), which is regarded to have had a good track record and can provide detailed predictions at a constituency level basis. The scale of Sunak's problems is demonstrated by the interactive maps below, showing just how much ground the Tories are expected to lose compared to their 2019 victory.Click on the arrows in the top left to switch between the two maps. Check your own constituency to see if it is projected to change handsThe first map above shows the seats won in the 2019 general election, when Boris Johnson led the party to a stunning majority.The wall of Tory blue on the map, compared to the spots of Labour red, is a demonstration of just how far Labour, then led by Jeremy Corbyn, had fallen in public standing. The result was Labour's worst electoral performance since 1935.If you toggle to the second map, the projection by YouGov (which was based on polling carried out between 24 May - 1 June) suggests that Starmer's party is on track to win 422 seats, with the Tories down to just 140.Such a result would be the Conservative Party's worst performance at a general election since 1906. If YouGov's predictions are accurate, Labour winning a 194-seat majority would be the highest number since Conservative Stanley Baldwin won a majority of 208 in 1924.The model suggests the Conservatives could be set for near wipeout across many areas of the country, including London, the North East, the North West, and Wales.It also projects that the Scottish National Party would lose more than half their seats, with Labour returning as the largest party north of the border, and the Liberal Democrats reclaiming its place as the third party of British politics – winning 48 seats.The new figures, released yesterday, came as Reform UK co-founder Nigel Farage announced that he would be returning as the populist party's leader and would stand for election in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. Even before Farage's latest bid, pollsters told Yahoo News that Reform UK could pose a serious threat to the Tories by splitting the vote and potentially handing even more seats to Labour.The YouGov projection follows a similar poll by modelling site Electoral Calculus, which came out on 31 May. The polling also compares the 2019 result with Electoral Calculus' projection.It predicts that Labour is on course to win an even bigger majority of 319 seats - with Starmer's party picking up 485 MPs and the Tories way behind with 66. The modelling shows the Lib Dems getting very close to the Conservative Party, with 59 seats.While Electoral Calculus' polling, based on opinion polls from 8 May to 20 May, returns a different set of projections to YouGov's, both clearly indicate the scale of the problem facing Sunak.The Electoral Calculus model has predicted Sir Keir Starmer's Labour will win a massive majority.

PA Media: UK News,Reform UK candidate drops out and backs Tories amid racism row,[],"Nina Lloyd, PA Political Correspondent",30 June 2024 at 5:11 pm·4-min read,30,June,2024,05:11:00,4,"A Reform UK candidate has criticised a “failure of leadership” amid allegations of racism within the party as he stepped down and backed the Conservatives in another blow to Nigel Farage’s campaign.Liam Booth-Isherwood, who was standing in the seat of Erewash, announced he was dropping out of the race and would instead be endorsing Tory contender Maggie Throup to “stop Labour”.The candidate said he had become “increasingly disillusioned” with the behaviour of the party, which he suggested pointed to a “significant moral issue” within its ranks.Because nominations for the July 4 poll have closed, Mr Booth-Isherwood will still appear on the ballot paper.But he has urged voters in the Derbyshire constituency to support the Conservative candidate Ms Throup, who has represented Erewash since 2015.Mr Booth-Isherwood said in a statement: “I am today announcing my decision to leave the Reform Party and have suspended my campaign as the Reform candidate for Erewash with immediate effect.“Over the past few weeks, I have been increasingly disillusioned with the behaviour and conduct of Reform.“Whilst I have campaigned alongside many decent, honest and hardworking people during the course of the General Election campaign in Erewash, the reports of widespread racism and sexism in Reform have made clear that there is a significant moral issue within certain elements of the party, and the failure of the party’s leadership to not only take this matter seriously, but also to fundamentally address it, has made clear to me that this is no longer a party I want to be associated with.“As a result, I am announcing my endorsement of the Conservative Party candidate, Maggie Throup, for Erewash. Only she can stop Labour.”Party chairman Richard Tice claimed the switch in support suggested that Conservatives were offering jobs and inducements to Reform candidates “to persuade them to talk badly of Reform, stand down and then endorse the Tory candidate”.“This shows dark forces at play by desperate Tories,” he wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter.It comes after Mr Farage faced accusations from across the political divide of failing to tackle allegations of racism within Reform which have engulfed the party in recent days.Addressing a rally in Birmingham earlier on Sunday, the party leader insisted that “the bad apples are gone” after withdrawing support for three candidates over the row.Nigel Farage has faced accusations from across the political divide of failing to tackle allegations of racism within Reform (Matthew Cooper/PA)Campaigners for Reform in the Clacton seat Mr Farage hopes to win in Essex were also recorded by an undercover journalist from Channel 4 making racist comments, including about the Prime Minister, who is of Indian descent.Another activist described the Pride flag as “degenerate” and suggested members of the LGBT community are paedophiles.Mr Farage has suggested that the Channel 4 footage is a “set-up” – a claim the broadcaster strenuously denies.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was hurt and angered by the racist term used about him (Joe Giddens/PA)Meanwhile, Reform has confirmed it has dropped support for candidates Leslie Lilley in Southend East and Rochford; Edward Oakenfull in Derbyshire Dales; and Robert Lomas in Barnsley North.They will also appear on the ballot paper but have lost party backing.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he shared Mr Sunak’s “disgust” at the use of the slur, which the Prime Minister has condemned as “vile” and “racist”.Channel 4 hit back at the suggestion it had paid Mr Parker to be in the footage, with a spokesperson for the broadcaster saying: “We met Mr Parker for the first time at Reform UK party headquarters, where he was a Reform party canvasser.”The Tories said that if 130,000 voters joined the Reform UK candidate who switched to back the Conservatives “it would be enough to stop Labour’s supermajority”.“Mr Booth-Isherwood knows a vote for Reform is a vote for Keir Starmer,” a party spokesman said.“There is no doubt, only a vote for the Conservatives can prevent an unaccountable majority for Labour, and the ruin this would bring for the country.”A Labour spokesperson said: “This is further proof that the only way to get the change we need is to vote Labour on July 4.“After 14 years of Tory chaos, Labour is the only party with a plan for economic security, secure borders, the NHS back on its feet, cheaper bills, safer streets and better opportunities for our children.”Ms Throup said she was “delighted” that Mr Booth-Isherwood was backing her campaign, saying in a post on X: “He has taken the brave step to make a stand agaist some of the serious issues we have seen within certain elements of the Reform Party, and I commend him for this.”"

The Conservatives go into election day having lost more than half of their support, and polling more than 10 points below their worst ever previous result. No wonder that polls project a record swing to Labour, larger, by far, than in any previous postwar election.Some projections have the Tories falling below 100 seats – an extinction-level event for Britain’s oldest and most electorally successful party. Thursday looks set to be a night of historic political drama: here are the key things to look out for as the night goes on.Interactive1 The exit poll and the early running: were the polls right? Is the exit poll right?The show begins at 10pm, when the polls close and the exit poll is published. This will give us a first sense of the scale of what is to come. If late swing or polling error is going to deliver a surprise, the exit poll is when we will first see it.Discussion of exit poll projections will dominate the early hours as politicians and pundits await the first results, and some will be sure to cast doubt as to accuracy. Ignore them. While no method is perfect, the exit poll has an excellent recent track record and can be trusted to chart the broad contours of the night to come.InteractiveThe next big moments will come about midnight, when the first seats declare. The very first is likely to be in Sunderland, which has made fast counts a speciality in recent contests. The key things to watch for is how the swing and result compare to exit poll projections, and how Reform UK is doing. Cramlington and Killingworth, another early reporting north-east seat, is worth watching, as its predecessor, Blyth Valley, was the first “red wall” seat taken by the Tories in 2019, and will be the first brick in a rebuilt red wall for Labour this time.With polling suggesting weaker swings to Labour in the seats it already holds, the best early indicators will come from the trio of early-declaring Conservative seats. Swindon South is a classic swing seat, which Labour should take easily. Two others, Broxbourne, and Basildon and Billericay, provide sterner tests – each requires a swing of more than 20 points to take, substantially above the current polling averages. Losing either or both of these seats will be a ­bitter early blow for Conservatives and may be an early sign of a Labour landslide to come.2 Red wall restoration? Will Labour recover seats lost to the Conservatives since 2015?The fall of the red wall was a ­bitter blow for Labour in 2019, as seat after seat turned against the party they had backed for generations. Recovering the lost heartlands is not just a matter of sentiment – Labour cannot win a majority without a rebuilt red wall.The early-to-declare red-wall seats are all near-certain to be Labour gains. But watch to see how high the majorities go when Leigh and Atherton, and then Darlington, declare earlier – this will give some hint about the scale of Labour’s recovery.Recovering Bolsover, the seat for nearly 50 years of leftwing firebrand Dennis Skinner, will be a particular morale boost for Labour leftwingers. But it will be victories in Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes, and in Scunthorpe, that will suggest Labour is on course to fully sweep the red wall, as these are seats where the Conservatives have larger notional majorities to defend. A win later in Bassetlaw would be the icing on the cake, meaning Labour had recovered the seat that saw the largest swing against them in 2019.The conclusion of the red wall story will come in Spen Valley after dawn. A win for Labour candidate Kim Leadbeater here will bring Keir Starmer’s recovery story full circle. It was Leadbeater’s narrow victory in the Batley and Spen byelection that steadied the Starmer ship in summer 2021, after a bruising set of local and byelection defeats had called his leadership into question. Now a second victory for Leadbeater in Spen Valley could help to complete the leader’s remarkable Labour comeback.3 Tartan tides: Will Scotland fall to Labour too?One of the underdiscussed subplots of this election is the huge SNP-to-Labour swing in Scottish polling. This is as large as the swing south of the border and, with the SNP vote evenly spread, dozens of SNP seats are now on a knife-edge. Hamilton and Clyde Valley, which should declare before 2am, provides the first real test. Labour needs an eight-point swing and could be in for a disappointing night in Scotland if they fall short. A Labour win in East Kilbride and Strathaven, where they need a 13-point swing, will suggest big gains to come, while a win in Dundee Central, reporting after 2am, would suggest a Scottish earthquake is coming – this is the SNP’s safest seat.InteractiveTwo Scottish subplots will develop later on. The first is the fate of seats contested between the Conservatives and the SNP. With both parties declining, but their opponents often weak and fragmented, these are hard seats to call. Some may end up as three-way or even four-way marginals, and surprise wins from third or even fourth place can’t be ruled out. The Lib Dems provide the other Scottish subplot. They are only in direct contention in a handful of Scottish seats, but have deep roots in parts of Scotland and would also dearly like to avenge the 2019 defeat of Jo Swinson by recovering Mid Dunbartonshire, the successor to the former leader’s East Dunbartonshire seat.4 Will the blue wall fall to the Lib Dems?This election is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the Liberal Democrats. Political geography, long their worst enemy, is finally working in their favour, as they start in second place to a flailing government in dozens of seats. They stand also to benefit from a helpful Labour party with an unthreatening leader, which should make it easier to maximise tactical voting and to win over Tory moderates voters spooked by Corbyn but now reassured by Starmer.InteractiveThe first signs of Lib Dem ­progress will come about 2am, when two seats at opposite ends of England, Harrogate and Knaresborough, and Torbay, report. Both had Lib Dem MPs during the New Labour years, and the Lib Dems will hope to recover both this week. Torbay – Brexity and bluer – is the tougher task.We will learn if we are in for a more dramatic Lib Dem breakthrough after about 3am, when seats such as Stratford-on-Avon, Epsom and Ewell, and Witney report their results. These heartland seats have all reliably returned Tory MPs for a century or more – and all require big swings. Victory for the Lib Dems in David Cameron’s former seat of Witney would be a potent symbol of a possible revolt by home counties Tory stalwarts against the populist, Brexit-flavoured Conservatism of Cameron’s successors.5 The Farage effect: where could Reform win outright and where will they tip the balance against the Tories?The return of Nigel Farage has upended this campaign, with a Reform UK bounce further damaging grim Tory prospects. Yet Reform’s support is too evenly spread, and the party’s organisation too weak, for Farage to gain many seats outright. Reform’s biggest impact will instead come through tipping the balance against the Conservatives in hundreds of seats.We can see this by looking at how many seats Labour alone gains at different levels of swing and different levels of Conservative-to-Reform switching. At each level of swing, Labour can make 100 or more extra seat gains if we move from a low to high rate of Conservative-to-Reform switching.InteractiveThe scale of the defeat will depend heavily on the share of Conservative voters who end up in the Reform column. Castle Point will give an early indication – the Conservatives start with a huge majority here, but Ukip topped 30% in this heavily leave-voting seat. If either Reform or Labour wins here, it will ­suggest a Reform surge and a Tory slump are coming in heavily leave-voting areas. Mansfield, Norfolk North and Great Yarmouth will provide three tests of the Reform effect. Strong Reform performances could help Labour win Mansfield and the Lib Dems win Norfolk North, and turn Great Yarmouth into a three-way marginal.Reform won’t win many seats but could win a few. Clacton is the likeliest gain, with polling suggesting Nigel Farage will finally win a Commons seat at the eighth attempt. Boston and Skegness, where Farage’s predecessor, Richard Tice, is standing, is another prospect, as is Ashfield, where Tory-to-Reform defector Lee Anderson faces a chaotic local dogfight with Labour and the popular independent council leader Jason Zadrozny. It is also worth watching how Reform do in Barnsley – the only place where the Brexit party came second in 2019.6 Red and blue breakthroughs for the Greens?While Reform will be the smaller party making the biggest waves in this contest, advances for the Greens could be a sign of disruptions to come. The Greens are targeting four seats. They are looking to hold off a Labour challenge in Brighton Pavilion, where the first Green MP, Caroline Lucas, is standing down, and defeat Labour in Bristol Central, where Green co-leader Carla Denyer is running against Labour shadow cabinet minister Thangam Debbonaire. The Greens are also targeting two deep-blue rural seats – Waveney Valley and North Herefordshire. Both constituency polls and MRP models suggest they are in with a strong chance in all four contests.The Greens will also hope to build a platform for future success with strong second places in other seats where local support is strong. Keep an eye on results in the Isle of Wight, Sheffield and in central London and Manchester seats. None are likely to fall to the Greens, but second-place finishes could set them up as contenders in contests to come.7 Trouble in Labour’s backyard?Keir Starmer faces some tricky defences in Labour’s backyard, particularly in seats with large Muslim electorates or high-profile independents. George Galloway mobilised unrest over the Gaza conflict among Muslim voters to take Rochdale from Labour in a byelection earlier this spring. Labour will dearly hope to retake the seat from Galloway in the rematch. Labour is also fighting off challenges from Galloway’s Workers Party of Britain and Galloway-aligned independents in seats with large Muslim communities such as Birmingham Ladywood, where Akhmed Yakoob hopes to unseat Labour shadow cabinet minister Shabana Mahmood.Then there is the messy contest in Leicester East, the seat with the largest Hindu electorate in Britain. Two former Labour MPs, Keith Vaz and Claudia Webbe, are standing against their former party, while Labour also faces a threat from resurgent local Conservatives, who made major gains in Leicester in 2023 local elections. This seat, along with two outer London seats – Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner and Harrow East – are worth watching to see if Rishi Sunak’s rise as the first ever Hindu prime minister has accelerated a long-term drift towards the Conservatives among Hindu voters.Finally, in Islington North, Labour faces a unique challenge, when Keir Starmer’s predecessor as Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, challenges his former party in the seat he represented for more than 40 years, mostly as a Labour MP.8 Return of New Labour? Seats Blair won in 1997 that Starmer could win backTo what extent will Starmer’s win be a restoration of the 1997 Blair ascendancy? There are 199 seats which Blair would have won on current boundaries in 1997 and which Labour does not currently hold. If polling proves accurate, Starmer could regain 150 or more of these lost New Labour seats.InteractiveThe first big test of Starmer’s recovery in middle England will come when Swindon North reports before 2am. The seat backed Blair three times and has swung heavily to the Tories since. Labour needs a 14-point swing to recover it.Cannock Chase provides an even bigger test. This Staffordshire seat has proved to be one of the swingiest in the country, going from a 55% Labour vote in 1997 to a near 70% Conservative vote in 2019. If Labour wins here, it will suggest Keir Starmer has won back the hearts of middle England – or is at least benefiting from a total Tory rejection in Blair’s old heartlands.Keep an eye out later in the night for results from classic suburban and small town bellwethers such as Crawley, Romford, Dudley and Nuneaton. Blair won them all and if Starmer is going on to match his predecessor, so should he. Tamworth, which Labour lost after Blair and won back on a huge swing in a recent byelection, is another seat to watch.9 Bigger than Blair? Seats Starmer could win which never backed New LabourWith Keir Starmer projected to achieve the largest swing in postwar history, Labour can set their sights higher than even the landslide victory of 1997, targeting seats which Blair never won but which demographic change, and exceptional polling, make winnable next week.The first signs that Starmer may be advancing into uncharted territory will come between 2am and 3am, when North West Cambridgeshire and Aldershot declare. Neither has ever elected a Labour MP, and both require very large swings, but most MRP models now favour the opposition in both. Labour could also take the once true-blue seats of Blair-era Tory big beasts, including Ken Clarke’s Rushcliffe and John Major’s Huntingdon.InteractiveIf Labour also manages to hold Mid Bedfordshire, which they took on a massive swing in a byelection, and gain places such as Isle of Wight West or Bexhill and Battle, which have never returned Labour MPs before, then we will probably be on course for a “bigger than Blair” majority as the Conservative retreat turns into a rout.10 ‘A new dawn has ­broken, has it not?’ How low could the Tories go?The broad outlines of the electoral landscape will be clear well before dawn. While the scale and scope of a probable Labour victory settled, two questions will remain: how many Conservatives will survive? And who will be the “big beasts” of the outgoing government whose defeat will provide the “Portillo moments” of this election night?If the swings in this election become very large, the fate of many Conservative MPs may turn on the ability of voters in very safe Tory seats to coalesce behind a single opponent in seats where the tactical voting signals are not clear.A total Tory wipeout becomes plausible if Liberal Democrats can perform as well as Labour at very high levels of overall swing. But if – as is perhaps more likely – tactical voting rates are weaker in very safe Tory seats with split opposition, then dozens of Conservatives may survive even if their party’s national vote collapses.InteractivePortillo moments won’t be hard to find next week. With a historically unprecedented swing expected, the list of high-profile MPs at risk is long. Defeat looks all but certain for former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith and self-styled Brexit hardman Steve Baker, while losses for serial cabinet minister and leadership hopeful Grant Shapps or chancellor Jeremy Hunt will not come as a surprise – most pollsters project them to lose.The true Portillo moment combines shock and gravity – a big beast felled unexpectedly in a seat thought to be safe, sending shockwaves through the party ranks. The loss of Hunt, a serving chancellor, would be a bitter blow but not a surprising one. Losses for Robert Jenrick (Newark) or Penny Mordaunt (Portsmouth North) would be more consequential, reshaping the leadership contest to come. Defeat for polarising GB News favourites such as Jacob Rees-Mogg (North East Somerset and Hanham) and Esther McVey (Tatton) will dismay the right and delight the left.With unprecedented swings on the cards, there is even an outside chance that this election count could deliver the ultimate Portillo moment – the defeat of a current or former prime minister. Both Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have daunting majorities, but Sunak has felt vulnerable enough to send activists to his own seat, while the ever-unpopular Truss could underperform her own party if angry local voters mobilise against her. Sunak’s seat is due to report first. If he manages to survive, then it may perhaps fall to Truss to symbolise the Conservatives’ election night with the same quality that defined her premiership: spectacular and unprecedented political failure.Robert Ford is professor of political science at Manchester University and co-author of The British General Election of 2019"

Many also assume his title is hereditary.So what do you really need to know about the man who, on current poll ratings, is set to be the UK’s next prime minister?His early lifeStarmer was born in Southwark, south London, in 1962, as the second of four children. His parents were Labour Party members and named him after Keir Hardie, the party’s first leader in parliament.The family moved out of the capital and he grew up in Hurst Green, a village just outside the small Surrey town of Oxted. He was active in youth politics from his teenage years but was also a skilled musician, taking music lessons alongside Norman Cook, who later became better known as a member of The Housemartins and the DJ Fatboy Slim.Starmer played the flute, piano, violin and recorder and was a junior exhibitioner at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.His familyStarmer is married to Victoria, a former solicitor who later retrained in occupational health and now works for the NHS. The pair met through their work in the law in the early 2000s and married in Essex in 2007.She was first seen accompanying her husband when the couple were filmed clapping for carers during the pandemic in 2020 outside their home in Camden. They have two children, a son and daughter, but both are kept out of the public eye.Victoria's father was Jewish and originally came from Poland, while her mother converted when they got married. Starmer has said in a previous interview that ""my wife in particular wants our children to know the faith of her family"" and that they ""observe some of the practices, for example Friday night prayers"".Keir Starmer with parents, Rodney and Josephine, at his graduation. (Twitter/Keir Starmer)His parentsThe Labour leader's father, Rodney Starmer, worked as a toolmaker in a factory, and his mother Josephine Starmer (née Baker), was a nurse.His father worked long, 14-hour days but spent his time outside work caring for Josephine, who was diagnosed with the autoimmune condition Still’s disease. She required two hip and knee replacements twice in her lifetime and struggled with arthritic pain.As a young man Starmer also helped care for his mother, which he has said led to him being more emotionally reserved. His sister, Katy, recalled: “He’s had to be a grown-up all his life. I’ve always been quite open about my feelings – Keir is good at most things, but not that.” Josephine Starmer died in 2015, and his father three years later.His educationStarmer passed the 11-plus examination, and attended Reigate Grammar School from age 11. While he was at the school it became an independent fee-paying institution, but as an existing student he was exempt from fees, and his tuition in the sixth form was covered by a bursary.After school he studied law at the University of Leeds, this first in his family to attend university, graduating with a first class degree in 1985. He undertook postgraduate law studied at the University of Oxford, where he served as editor of a radical magazine, Socialist Alternatives.A photograph of a younger Starmer as shown on ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories in 2021. (ITV)Why is he a sir?Stamer was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 2014 in recognition of his work in the legal profession, culminating in a five-year term as director of public prosecutions (DPP).He first became a barrister in 1987 at the Middle Temple, later joining Doughty Street Chambers and was appointed a Queen’s counsel in 2002, aged just 39. In 2008 he was appointed head of the Crown Prosecution Service and DPP.During his tenure he chose to prosecute three Labour MPs and a Conservative in the wake of the parliamentary expenses scandal, and was responsible for prosecuting former MP Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce for perverting the course of justice after Pryce claimed responsibility for her former husband’s speeding offence.Starmer on... the NHSThe Labour leader has said that, if elected, his government would “get the NHS working around the clock and pay staff properly to do it”.The remark followed a commitment to provide £1.1bn in funding for the health service to cut waiting lists by paying doctors and nurses to carry out additional out-of-hours care, which would be funded by axing tax breaks for wealthy “non-doms” who hoard money overseas. He added: “The Conservative Party that brought our NHS to its knees will put it in the ground. We have to get it back on its feet.”Starmer describes the NHS as “the crowdfunded solution for all of us”, reinforcing his commitment to healthcare being free at the point of use, but says reform is inevitable or the health service would “remain on life support”. He has pledged to integrate up-to-date technology into every part of the NHS including using artificial intelligence to diagnose disease earlier and more accurately.He supported the doctors strikes, telling ministers: “Don’t break junior doctors, talk to them. Get in the room [and] sort it out.”Starmer with his wife, Lady Victoria Starmer, at the Labour Party Conference in October 2023. (Alamy)Starmer on… immigrationThe government has “lost control of borders”, according to Labour. Starmer has said a Labour government would set up a new policy unit to tackle illegal migration and has suggested that a returns agreement for asylum seekers could be negotiated with the European Union to solve the small boats crisis.He described the government’s thwarted Rwanda plan, which would see illegal migrants deported to the African nation but has to be put into practice due to legal blocks, as a “gimmick” and a “farce” and has promised to reverse it.Starmer on... the cost of living crisisStarmer has sought to keep Rishi Sunak’s handling of the cost of living crisis in the minds of voters by claiming that “his fingerprints are all over their struggling household budgets”. In a letter to his shadow cabinet, leaked to The Guardian, he wrote: “Rishi Sunak is the chief architect of choices prioritising the wealthiest and of the government’s failure to get a grip of the economy and get growth going.”He has said he would prioritise tackling inflation, blaming it for putting up prices and eroding household savings, but has pledged to “take the difficult and responsible decisions” to bring it down.Keir Starmer pictured in 2010, when he was director of public prosecutions, making a statement about MPs who face charges over their expenses claims. (Getty)Starmer on... private schoolsLabour has dropped its early promise to scrap charitable status for private schools, but has committed to levying a 20% VAT rate on school fees removing their “unfair tax break”. The money raised, he said, will be used to address the “appalling state” of the school system for all children.“It’s not an attack on private schools. It’s just saying an exemption you have had is going to go,” he warned private schools who have been critical of the plan – reminding them they are not obliged to pass that tax on to parents in the form of increased fees.Starmer on… the House of LordsWhen he was first Labour leader, Starmer proposed a “root and branch reform of the centre of government… rooting out unearned privilege and addressing unaccountable power”.But his promise to scrap the House of Lords within the first four years of a new parliament – a controversial move that caused a split among his party’s grandees, has been abandoned.Starmer still backs plans for a second chamber “electoral legitimacy”, but as his party nears government he has stepped away from the most radical form of that pledge. He is now reportedly committed to cutting the number of hereditary peers, reducing the size of the chamber and introducing a new appointments process."

He made the economy and combating global security the key elements of his pitch to the nation as he announced the election date.In response, Starmer told voters: “Together we can stop the chaos, we can turn the page, we can start to rebuild Britain.”But amid this “uncertainty” and need to “rebuild”, what do the voters consider the key issues?This chart, produced using YouGov polling over the course of this parliament, offers an insight in the issues voters care most about and how that has ebbed and flowed over time.Compared to when Boris Johnson's Tories won the December 2019 poll, the economy, immigration, defence and tax have grown in importance in the eyes of the electorate. This has come amid the cost of living crisis; small boats crossing the English Channel; the onset of the Ukraine war and wider global instability; and the highest tax burden in 70 years.Housing has also become a bigger concern, with the Renters Reform Bill - in which the government pledged to scrap no-fault evictions - having been paused after Sunak called the election.Meanwhile, the last general election was fought - and won by the Tories - on a single issue: Brexit. Yet the chart shows a clear downturn in its relevance among voters, particularly after a trade deal was agreed with the EU in December 2020.This next chart, meanwhile, highlights what voters have considered the top issues over the past year. By a wide margin, the top three are the economy, health and immigration and asylum.Here, Yahoo News UK breaks down what is behind these issues and how they have ebbed and flowed in importance among voters since the last election in 2019.The economyThe unprecedented lockdown called by Boris Johnson in March 2020 meant the public’s attention shifted to the economy, as demonstrated by the huge spike in the chart above. The then-chancellor Rishi Sunak was forced to implement a £70bn furlough scheme, lasting 18 months, to protect people’s jobs.There was a second almighty economic shock - and rise in public concern - in February 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This caused a further spike in an already turbulent wholesale energy market, driving up costs for suppliers and ultimately customers.Average energy bills eventually reached £2,500 a year (and would have exceeded £4,000 had the government not intervened). This was double the £1,278 consumers were paying before the war and by the time this election takes place, people will still be paying much more than this: £1,568.Energy prices were also a key driver in inflation reaching 11.1% - a 41-year high - by October 2022, though it has since fallen to 2.3%, which is near the Bank of England’s 2.0% target.The third economic shock of this parliament - and most damaging for the Tories - was in October 2022 when Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng's disastrous “mini budget”, containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, prompted an economic crisis. It led to soaring interest rates, and to this day homeowners who are remortgaging are facing significantly higher bills.HealthHealth, like the economy, is another issue which clearly correlated with the beginning of the pandemic. The above chart shows an enormous spike in public concern when COVID cases started to multiply in March 2020, ultimately leading to the nationwide lockdown as the NHS faced collapse.Cases fell that summer, but spikes in the chart can be seen once infections rose again and fresh nationwide lockdowns were imposed in October 2020 and January 2021. By March 2022, likely as concerns over the Omicron variant faded, there was much less concern about health.In January last year, there was a brief spike as the NHS in England experienced the biggest industrial action in its history, with tens of thousands of nurses and ambulance staff walking out simultaneously.As for the state of play going into the election, NHS waiting lists remain higher than they were when Sunak vowed to cut them last year. According to the latest figures, an estimated 7.54 million treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of March, relating to 6.29 million patients.Immigration and asylumSince the last election, the immigration and asylum narrative has largely revolved around one issue: small boats crossing the English Channel.The numbers have risen in most of the intervening years: there were 1,843 crossings in 2019, 8,466 in 2020, 28,526 in 2021, 45,774 in 2022 and 29,437 last year. This year, the number has already passed the 10,000 mark.The regular sharp spikes in the above chart demonstrate how frequently crossings have been in the news, including some occasions when hundreds of migrants have made the dangerous journey in a single day.But it also reflects how the government has made this part of its own agenda. It was Boris Johnson’s government which first announced plans to deport migrants to Rwanda in April 2022. That policy was picked up by Rishi Sunak when he became prime minister in October that year, with Sunak since repeating his pledge to “stop the boats”.But after calling the election, Sunak admitted this week that flights would not take off before the country goes to the polls.Read moreFive important laws that could be dropped due to Sunak's snap election (Yahoo News UK)OPINION - Rishi Sunak has been in last-ditch campaign mode for so long — a General Election is logical (Evening Standard)Door open for Boris Johnson to campaign for Tories, Rishi Sunak signals (PA Media)"
The Guardian,French elections: far right wins first-round victory. What happens now?,"['What are the rules of the two-round system?', 'How does it usually work?', 'What’s different about this election?', 'What generally happens in “triangular” contests?', 'So what will happen this time?']",Jon Henley Europe correspondent,1 July 2024 at 3:08 am·5-min read,1,July,2024,03:08:00,5,"The National Rally (RN) has won 33% of the popular vote in the first round of France’s snap two-round general election, according to final results, with the leftwing New Popular Front (NFP) alliance on 28% and President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist Together bloc on 21%.A national vote share, however, is extremely difficult to translate into a projected number of seats in the assemblée nationale. That’s because the final outcome will depend on the results in the constituencies. Pollsters issue seat estimates, but France’s polling watchdog does not endorse them.Here’s a guide to what comes next as voters gear up for the decisive second round of voting on 7 July, when France could decide to give control of its government to the far-right, anti-immigrant party for the first time in its history.What are the rules of the two-round system?To win one of the 577 seats in the national assembly in the first round, a candidate must get more than 50% of ballots cast, representing at least 25% of registered voters.This happens only rarely, although the 2024 election’s high turnout has seen the number of candidates who won in the first round rise sharply to 80.If no candidate in a constituency achieves that, the two highest scorers plus anyone else who collected at least 12.5% of total registered voters advance to a second round. In that round, the candidate who obtains the most votes is elected.How does it usually work?The two-round system is highly disproportionate and artificially boosts larger parties. On a turnout of 65%, for example, the 12.5% hurdle means parties would have to secure the backing of almost 20% of eligible voters to advance to the second round.In recent legislative elections, turnout has been significantly lower than that, meaning that in almost every constituency, only two candidates have gone through to the second round and the number of three- or four-way contests has been very low.In the 2012 elections, with a turnout of 57%, there were 34 so-called “triangular” runoffs. In 2017, when turnout was 49%, there was only one, and last time around in 2022 there were eight on a turnout of just 47%. The previous record was 76, in 1997.What’s different about this election?The combination of the highest turnout since the 1980s and fewer candidates – 4,011 against 6,290 in 2022 – from just three main camps (left, centre and far right) – means the second round of the 2024 ballot will feature a record number of “triangular” contests.With 67% of registered voters casting a ballot on Sunday, voters in a huge number of constituencies could, in principle, face a three-way race on 7 July - as many as 306, according to the official results, half the seats in the assembly.In theory, three- or four-way contests should work in favour of the party with the largest share of the vote in the first round – in these elections, generally RN – because the opposition vote is split. Many three-way contests, however, do not stay that way.What generally happens in “triangular” contests?Until recently, if the RN looked like winning a seat in a three-way race, the second- and third-placed parties would negotiate, at local and national level, to determine whose candidates would drop out.To be successful, however, that strategy requires both that the mainstream parties are willing to withdraw candidates, and that voters are happy to play along, with centre-left voters backing a candidate from the centre right, and vice-versa.But that “Republican front” has been steadily fraying, with voters increasingly unwilling to “hold their noses” and cast their ballots for parties whose policies do not necessarily align with their political preferences. In 2022, RN returned a record 89 deputies.So what will happen this time?As far as the parties go, senior figures in the four-party left-green NFP alliance – including the firebrand leader of the radical left France Unbowed (LFI), Jean-Luc Mélenchon – have promised that in all constituencies where RN is in first place and an NFP candidate is in third, the NFP candidate will withdraw.Macron’s camp has been far less clear about what its candidates would do in a similar position, with the president and party leaders calling both rival camps “extreme” – in the case of NFP, largely because it is dominated by LFI.The prime minister, Gabriel Attal, said on Sunday that third-placed candidates should step aside: “Not one single vote must go to the National Rally.” Some candidates from Macron’s coalition, however, may not withdraw faced with a candidate from LFI.As far as voters go, things are even more complicated. An Ipsos poll last week found 87% NFP voters willing to cast their ballot to block RN, but only 62% of Together voters. Another poll, by Odoxa, found that fewer voters (41%) were willing to block RN than to block NFP (47%) or Together (44%).In short, the situation is highly uncertain and will remain fluid until the actual candidates running in the second round become clear. With up to half the seats in the assembly potentially becoming three-way contests, the scope for an anti-RN “Republican front” is clearly there – but the extent of inter-party cooperation will be critical, as will be voters’ willingness to vote tactically."
