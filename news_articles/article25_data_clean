Yahoo News UK,The Tory ministers and 'big beasts' who could lose MP seats in the electionSeveral big names in the Conservative Party are at risk of losing their seats in the general election.,"['Grant Shapps', 'Penny Mordaunt', 'Liz Truss', 'Jacob Rees-Mogg', 'Johnny Mercer', 'Victoria Prentis', 'Alex Chalk', 'David TC Davies']",Andy Wells,Updated 20 June 2024 at 2:51 am·5-min read,20,June,2024,02:51:00,5,"Rishi Sunak could become the first prime minister to lose his seat in a general election, according to new bombshell polling.According to the Savanta poll, which was commissioned by The Telegraph, the Conservatives are projected to win just 53 seats in the general election. Some three-quarters of the Cabinet would lose their seats in that scenario – including Sunak.Were Sunak to lose his seat in Richmond (Yorks), it would make him the first prime minister in history to lose their seat in a general election, according to the Institute for Government. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is also facing a battle to hold on to his constituency, with the vote on a “knife edge”.Savanta spoke to around 18,000 people between 7 June and 18 June for their poll. If reflected in the election, Labour would be on course to win 516 seats, with a commanding Commons majority of 382. The Liberal Democrats would have nearly as many seats (50) as the Tories.Jeremy Hunt: My constituency is on a knife edgeHunt could be among the Conservative casualties on the night of the 4 July poll, despite his newly-created seat in Godalming and Ash currently holding a Conservative majority of more than 10,000. He is facing a battle to win the seat in Surrey, with the Liberal Democrats keen on taking a high-profile scalp.Several other Tory ‘big beasts’ also face a tight vote to hold onto their seat, according to a major poll by Ipsos.Grant ShappsDefence secretary Grant Shapps may lose his seat in the election. (Getty)Defence secretary Grant Shapps, who had been touted as a potential leader of the Conservatives after the election, is at risk of losing his Welwyn Hatfield seat, according to Ipsos. Their polling suggests a likely Labour victory, with Sir Keir Starmer’s party currently on 48%, compared to 28% for the Conservatives.Shapps won the seat in the 2019 election with a vote share of 52.6%, increasing his majority from the previous election.Penny MordauntPenny Mordaunt’s seat is at risk from Labour. (PA)Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons, is another Tory MP whose name has been mentioned in a future leadership contest – in the event of the Tories losing the election. However, she may not even be an MP after 4 July as her Portsmouth North seat is at risk.Seen as “leaning Labour”, polling suggests Labour are on 42%, compared to the Tories on 34%. She won 61.4% of the vote in the 2019 election.Liz TrussFormer prime minister Liz Truss may not be an MP after the election. (PA)Former prime minister Liz Truss is at risk in her South West Norfolk seat. The seat is seen as a “toss up”, with Truss currently in the lead at 31%. Labour are a sitting at 27% but Reform UK are polling 30%.Allowing for margins of error and another two weeks of campaigning, the seat will be hotly contested between all three parties on 4 July.Jacob Rees-MoggJacob Rees-Mogg is on track to lose his seat at the general election. (PA)While no longer a government minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg losing his North East Somerset and Hanham seat would perhaps be one of the night’s bigger surprises. Rees-Mogg has been an outspoken critic of some of Sunak’s policies and is a regular presenter on GB News.However, the Ipsos poll has the seat, which has been newly-created for the 2024 election, is currently showing a “likely Labour” win, with the party on 47%, compared to 30% for the Conservatives.Johnny MercerPolling suggests Johnny Mercer will lose his seat to Labour at the election. (PA)Veterans’ affairs secretary Johnny Mercer is standing for the Plymouth Moor View seat, having last won the seat in 2019 with an increased vote share of 60.7%. However, a “likely” Labour win is expected, with a projected vote share of 49% on 4 July. The Tories are currently polling at 30% – half of what they won in 2019.Victoria PrentisAttorney general Victoria Prentis is currently facing being replaced by Labour in the election. (PA)A “likely” Labour victory is predicted for Banbury, a seat currently held by attorney general Victoria Prentis. The Tories are polling at 30% in the constituency, compared to 40% for Labour. Prentis is notable for being the first British MP to take a Ukrainian refugee in her house following Russia’s invasion.Alex ChalkThe Libreal Democrats are projected to take over justice secretary Alex Chalk’s seat. (Alamy)Justice secretary Alex Chalk won 48% of the vote in the Cheltenham constituency in the 2019 election. However, the seat is now leaning to being “strong Liberal Democrat”, with Sir Ed Davey’s party polling 60% of the vote. Chalk and the Conservatives are projected to win 26% of the vote, according to Ipsos.David TC DaviesDavid TC Davies is projected to lose his seat in the general election. (PA)Welsh secretary David TC Davies is facing a “likely” Labour victory on 4 July, with the party projected to win 45% of the vote, compared to 30% for the Tories.

(Getty Images)With just over a week to go until the general election, Labour are still on track to win a historic majority in the Commons, according to a number of polls.One of the latest, carried out by research company Focaldata, predicts a 250-seat majority for Sir Keir Starmer's party, with a total of 450 seats. Meanwhile, Rishi Sunak's Conservative Party is on track to lose 262 seats, leaving it with just 110 left, which would be one of its worst-ever defeats.However, if there's one thing recent political events over the past decade have told us, pollsters don't always get it right and there may yet be a few surprises after voters head to polls on 4 July. Never forget that a week is a long time in politics,Nigel Farage's Reform UK is expected to win one seat, according to Focaldata, but YouGov pollster Patrick English claimed in early June that the populist party could win as many as four. The Liberal Democrats are expected to make sizeable gains and reclaim their place as the third biggest party in the Commons, while the SNP are predicted to suffer heavy losses following a turbulent period for the Scottish separatist party.Meanwhile, the Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer could win one new seat in Bristol Central by gaining votes from left-wing voters dismayed by Starmer's so-called ""purge"" of leftist candidates.As of 25 June, YouGov's Voting Intention tracker suggests 36% of voters will choose Labour, compared to 20% for the Tories, who are followed closely by Reform at 18%.

Evening Standard,Labour pledges to end 8am scramble for GP appointments by training more doctors and updating the NHS app,[],Robert Dex,25 June 2024 at 5:33 pm·2-min read,25,June,2024,05:33:00,2,"Labour has pledged to end the 8am scramble for GP appointments by training more doctors and updating the NHS app so slots are easy to book and rearrange.Under the party’s plans, family doctors, physiotherapists, mental health specialists, dentists, district nurses, care workers and health visitors would be brought under one roof as part of a trial of Neighbourhood Health Centres.Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said his party is also committed to bringing back the family doctor, to give patients continuity.Mr Streeting said: “The Health Secretary is too busy preparing her Conservative Party leadership campaign to stop the strikes in the NHS, or even to tell us what her plan is to get patients a GP appointment.“Rishi Sunak doesn’t understand how bad things are in the NHS, nor does he have a plan for the NHS, because he doesn’t use the NHS. Rishi Sunak isn’t waiting a month for a GP appointment, so he doesn’t care that you are.Wes Streeting and Sir Keir Starmer in a hospital (Stefan Rousseau/PA) (PA Wire)“The public will rightly conclude that nothing will change if the Conservatives get another five years, the chaos in the NHS will continue, and millions of patients will be left waiting a month just to see a GP.“Labour will provide the investment and reform needed to get patients seen on time again and bring back the family doctor.“In 2024, patients should not have to queue up at 8am on the phone to book an appointment, or worse still queue around the block.“We will end the 8am scramble by allowing patients to easily book appointments to see the doctor they want, in the manner they choose. But that change will only happen if people vote for the NHS and vote Labour on 4th July.”According to the party’s analysis of the GP patient survey, five million tried and failed to get a GP appointment every month in 2023.The Conservative Party’s manifesto says it wants to build 100 new GP surgeries in England, funded by reducing the number of NHS managers.The issue of private healthcare has been raised several times during the General Election campaign after Sir Keir Starmer said he would not pay to go private if he or a loved one faced a long wait for NHS treatment, while Rishi Sunak said he would.Labour has previously said it would use the private sector to treat NHS patients in the short term to get waiting lists down."

It is now looking ever-more likely that Sir Keir Starmer will be prime minister by next Friday.Nigel Farage may yet have a good election night as Reform UK are currently in third place in the polls. The polling for the party has slipped following the controversy over Farage’s comments about the war in Ukraine but the party is still some five percentage points ahead of the Lib Dems.Yahoo News UK summaries the positions of the parties the five polls.No major changes show Labour on course for large victoryA poll by Savanta puts Labour on 42% – 21 points ahead of the Tories, who are on 21%. Ipsos also puts Labour on 42%, compared to 19% for the Tories, while JL Partners give similar results, with Labour on 41% and the Tories on 25%.A Verian poll shows Labour on 38%, with the Tories on 21%, while Survation show Labour on 41%, compared to a historic low of 18% for the Tories.An average of opinion polls from February to June this year. (PA)An average of all polls with survey work completed during the seven days to 26 June puts Labour on 41%, 21 points ahead of the Conservatives on 20%, followed by Reform on 16%, the Lib Dems on 11% and the Greens on 6% – unchanged on the figures for the previous week.On 22 May, the day Sunak called the election, the seven-day averages stood at Labour 45%, Conservatives 23%, Reform 11%, Lib Dems 9% and Greens 6%.Tories to slump to lowest number of seats since party's formationEarlier this month, three major polls showed the Tories were on course for a historic defeat, slumping to the lowest number of seats since the party was formed.Using the multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP) technique, which enables projections to be made at constituency level, YouGov's polling for Sky News projected Labour being on course to achieve a 200-seat majority. The poll suggested Labour would secure 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.The YouGov poll for Sky News.A More In Common UK poll for the News Agents podcast showed Labour projecting to finish on 406 seats, with the Conservatives on 155.Meanwhile, polling by Savanta and Electoral Calculus for the Telegraph, showed Sunak could become the first sitting prime minister to lose his seat of Richmond and Northallerton to Labour. It put Labour on 516 seats, with the Tories on just 53.What are the latest odds?As of 26 June, Oddschecker – a website which compares odds across different bookmakers – had Labour at 1/41 to win the most seats. To put that in context, this is seen as so likely that a £10 bet would return just £10.24.The Conservatives are 80/1 to win the most seats, a scenario seen as so unlikely that a £10 punt would return £810.A Conservative majority government is also seen as so unlikely (125/1) that Oddschecker sees a Reform UK government as more likely (100/1).What went wrong for the Tories?YouGov's voting intention tracker between January 2020 and June 2024. (YouGov)So, why have the polls changed so dramatically? It's worth looking back on an extremely eventful four-and-a-half years in UK politics.According to YouGov's voting intention tracker (see chart, above), Tory support peaked at 53%, with Labour on 32%, in April 2020, months after the party's stunning success in the 2019 general election and Boris Johnson's pledge to “get Brexit done”. That month also saw Starmer take over as Labour leader from Jeremy Corbyn.This was also amid a spirit of national unity following the onset of the COVID pandemic which nearly killed Johnson himself. The then-PM had been released from hospital five days before this particular survey was taken.Boris Johnson delivers his final speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street in September 2022. (AFP via Getty Images)Over the rest of the year, there was a downturn in support amid chaos over COVID rules, with the Tories falling as low as 35% in November 2020, compared to Labour on 40%.However, the UK’s successful COVID vaccination programme provided a pathway out of lockdown and with it, improved poll ratings. Tory support peaked at 41% in June 2021, with Labour at 30%.In October that year, there was a sense Johnson was untouchable. At the Tory party conference, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg remarked how the PM was ""in total command of his party, and politically dominant in the country"".But this fell apart quickly with the Partygate scandal, which emerged in November that year. Time and again, reports emerged of government and Tory staff – including Johnson – having taken part in lockdown-era social gatherings when their own COVID rules had prohibited them.By January 2022, Tory support had plummeted to 28%, with Labour on 38%. Johnson struggled on, but never recovered and a wave of ministerial resignations forced him to resign in July that year.The UK had three separate prime ministers – Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak – between 6 September and 24 October, 2022. (Getty Images)His successor, Liz Truss, then embarked on arguably the most disastrous prime ministerial reign in history, characterised by the catastrophic ""mini-budget"", containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, which prompted an economic crisis. Like Johnson, she lost the confidence of Tory MPs – and voters – and had to resign.Her 49-day spell as PM was the shortest in history, with Tory support plummeting to 19% (with Labour on 56%) the day after she announced her resignation in October 2022.Rishi Sunak, who had lost to Truss in the previous month's Tory leadership election, took over. However, as the above YouGov chart indicates, he has failed to cut through with voters. Tory support was at 23% two days after he assumed office, with the most recent survey, carried out on Thursday, showing support is now lower than under Truss at 18%.In short, the polls and odds, not to mention other factors such as notable by-election victories for Starmer's Labour, are pointing to a Labour government next week.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

The Independent,Rishi Sunak brands David Tennant ‘the problem’ in trans rights row with Kemi Badenoch,[],Tara Cobham,26 June 2024 at 8:36 am·5-min read,26,June,2024,08:36:00,5,"Rishi Sunak has intervened in a deepening row between Kemi Badenoch and David Tennant over LGBTQ+ rights, appearing to brand the actor “the problem”.The Doctor Who star said he wished the women and equalities minister would “shut up” and suggested he hoped for a world in which she “doesn’t exist anymore”, while she fired back that he was a “bigot”.The prime minister waded in on the spat on Wednesday morning, writing on X, formerly Twitter: “Freedom of speech is the most powerful feature of our democracy. If you’re calling for women to shut up and wishing they didn’t exist, you are the problem.”David Tennant poses with the Celebrity Ally award at The British LGBT Awards 2024 in London on Friday (Getty Images)Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he “wouldn’t have engaged in the way” Mr Tennant did, telling broadcasters: “I think in politics, as in life, it’s really important that we are able to robustly disagree with others. Obviously, that happens a lot in the general election campaign, but we should do it with respect for everybody involved in that robust discussion.”The women and equalities minister has fronted the Tory election pledge to make biological sex a protected characteristic in the Equality Act. Currently, gender reassignment is a protected characteristic.Ms Badenoch vowed to continue speaking out and accused Mr Tennant of being a “rich, lefty, white male celebrity so blinded by ideology” in a post to X on Tuesday following his damning remarks made about her at the British LGBT Awards on Friday.Home Secretary James Cleverly was also among those who interjected in the row, calling for Mr Tennant to apologise for his remarks, as he wrote on X: “I’m not sure David understands the irony of trying to silence the voice of the most senior Black female politician in the UK’s history, in the name of ‘defending’ a minority community.”Women and Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch vowed to ‘not shut up’ (PA Wire)Mr Tennant, who won Celebrity Ally at the ceremony, received cheers and applause when he said of the Conservative Cabinet minister: “I don’t wish ill of her, I just wish her to shut up.”Ms Badenoch hit back, saying: “I will not shut up. I will not be silenced by men who prioritise applause from Stonewall over the safety of women and girls.“A rich, lefty, white male celebrity so blinded by ideology he can’t see the optics of attacking the only black woman in government by calling publicly for my existence to end.“Tennant is one of Labour’s celebrity supporters. This is an early example of what life will be like if they win.I will not shut up. I will not be silenced by men who prioritise applause from Stonewall over the safety of women and girls.

He and his supporters will do the same with the country.“Do not let the bigots and bullies win.”Mr Tennant is “one of the LGBTQ+ community’s most fierce allies and supporters”, according to the British LGBT Awards, and “often does red-carpet interviews while wearing pins associated with the community, with one particular Doctor Who-themed Tardis badge, designed in the colours of the Trans Pride flag, helping to raise thousands of pounds for charities”.He said in his acceptance speech: “If I’m honest I’m a little depressed by the fact that acknowledging that everyone has the right to be who they want to be and live their life how they want to live it as long as they’re not hurting anyone else should merit any kind of special award or special mention – because it’s common sense, isn’t it?Home Secretary James Cleverly was among those who waded into the row, calling for Mr Tennant to apologise for his remarks (Getty Images)“It is human decency. We shouldn’t live in a world where that is worth remarking on.“However, until we wake up and Kemi Badenoch doesn’t exist any more – I don’t wish ill of her, I just wish her to shut up – whilst we do live in this world, I am honoured to receive this.“I am thrilled to be here and to be a part of this night.

The Telegraph,The runners and riders to replace Rishi Sunak,[],Gordon Rayner,26 June 2024 at 11:23 am·3-min read,26,June,2024,11:23:00,3,"If the polls are to be believed, the Tories are in for a historic defeat on July 4.A major survey for The Telegraph this month put the Conservatives on just 53 seats, with high-profile casualties predicted to include Penny Mordaunt, Jeremy Hunt, James Cleverly, and Rishi Sunak himself.Even with a result half as bad as that prediction, it is likely Mr Sunak would resign,  or face an imminent leadership challenge.Here, The Telegraph takes a look at some of the potential contenders to replace him.The Business Secretary, who is also minister for women and equalities, is the current bookies’ favourite to be the next Tory leader. She also had the highest net satisfaction rating of any Cabinet minister among readers of the influential ConservativeHome website in May. She came fourth in the contest to succeed Boris Johnson in July 2022, and has hinted at a potential Tory leadership run after the election. She may be well placed in Westminster, given that Savanta’s bombshell MRP poll for The Telegraph forecast she would be the only “big beast” left standing after polling day.The Leader of the House of Commons came third in the 2022 leadership contest, and boosted her popularity and her name recognition with her prominent ceremonial role at last year’s Coronation. She was the third most popular Cabinet minister among ConservativeHome readers in May. However, if the Savanta projection is correct, she is on track to lose her seat to Labour on July 4.The former home secretary remains popular with the Tory base, who admired her tough stance on illegal migration. However, she might struggle to beat Mrs Badenoch for the support of the Right of the party, having made an early exit in the 2022 leadership race. The Savanta poll also suggests she is set to lose her seat to Labour at the general election.Having served as education secretary, foreign secretary, and now Home Secretary, Mr Cleverly is one of the Cabinet’s more experienced pairs of hands, though he ranked only 14th among ministers in ConservativeHome’s poll in May.  However, the Army Reserve Lieutenant Colonel is yet another Tory heavyweight likely to lose his seat, according to the Savanta survey, threatening to scupper any leadership ambitions he might harbour.The former home secretary is tipped as a grassroots favourite, and was recently urged by supporters to stand for the Tory leadership if the party is defeated at the election. Friends said Ms Patel had not ruled out the possibility of standing but was focused on retaining her Witham constituency in Essex, which she is set to lose to Labour, according to the Savanta poll.The former prime minister, now Foreign Secretary, could technically make a dramatic return as Tory leader, given that there is no requirement for the head of the official opposition (or indeed any opposition party) to hold a seat in the House of Commons. However, such a move would be unprecedented in modern times. The former premier may also pay heed to the fact that he had a negative approval rating with ConservativeHome readers in May.The Reform UK leader is currently doing his level best to unseat as many Tory (and Labour) MPs as possible, presumably making him rather unpopular with the Conservative base. But some have speculated he could take the reins from Mr Sunak by defecting from inside Westminster, if he succeeds in his eighth bid to become an MP.Could Mr Johnson be the Tories’ once and future king? He will not be an MP on July 4, having given up his seat in June last year and opted not to run again. But, like Lord Cameron, he could technically lead from outside Westminster."

The scale of Sunak's problems is demonstrated by the interactive maps below, showing just how much ground the Tories are expected to lose compared to their 2019 victory.Click on the arrows in the top left to switch between the two maps. Check your own constituency to see if it is projected to change handsThe first map above shows the seats won in the 2019 general election, when Boris Johnson led the party to a stunning majority.The wall of Tory blue on the map, compared to the spots of Labour red, is a demonstration of just how far Labour, then led by Jeremy Corbyn, had fallen in public standing. The result was Labour's worst electoral performance since 1935.If you toggle to the second map, the projection by YouGov (which was based on polling carried out between 24 May - 1 June) suggests that Starmer's party is on track to win 422 seats, with the Tories down to just 140.Such a result would be the Conservative Party's worst performance at a general election since 1906. If YouGov's predictions are accurate, Labour winning a 194-seat majority would be the highest number since Conservative Stanley Baldwin won a majority of 208 in 1924.The model suggests the Conservatives could be set for near wipeout across many areas of the country, including London, the North East, the North West, and Wales.It also projects that the Scottish National Party would lose more than half their seats, with Labour returning as the largest party north of the border, and the Liberal Democrats reclaiming its place as the third party of British politics – winning 48 seats.The new figures, released yesterday, came as Reform UK co-founder Nigel Farage announced that he would be returning as the populist party's leader and would stand for election in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. Even before Farage's latest bid, pollsters told Yahoo News that Reform UK could pose a serious threat to the Tories by splitting the vote and potentially handing even more seats to Labour.The YouGov projection follows a similar poll by modelling site Electoral Calculus, which came out on 31 May. The polling also compares the 2019 result with Electoral Calculus' projection.It predicts that Labour is on course to win an even bigger majority of 319 seats - with Starmer's party picking up 485 MPs and the Tories way behind with 66.

The polls have consistently painted a very bleak picture for the prime minister, with Labour holding on to a double-digit poll lead over his Conservatives.Recent by-election results suggest that Labour is likely to win a landslide victory – but there’s still time for the PM to turn it around.Here’s everything you need to know about Sunak and what’s he’s saying about the biggest issues in British politics right now.Early lifeSunak was born in Southampton in 1980, the eldest of three children. His Indian parents both arrived from East Africa in the 1960s. A football-mad boy whose childhood idol was Matt Le Tissier, Sunak was described by the family’s neighbours as a child with “lovely manners”.In his youngest years, the PM attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. According to a recent biography, fellow pupil Ollie Case said: “He was someone that was talked about. The teachers would say: ‘He’s going to be prime minister'.""But, growing up in the 1980s and 90s, he also remembers experiencing racism. “My mother was obsessed with us not having accents,” Sunak has said.Rishi Sunak was football-mad as a boy growing up in Southampton. (ITV)Sunak's familySunak is married to Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian entrepreneur and multi-billionaire. The pair first met in 2004 at Stanford University, his future wife apparently attracted to his “honesty and integrity”.Five years later they married in a two-day Indian wedding held in Bangalore. The couple have two daughters, Krishna and Anoushka, who will turn 13 and 11 this year, both of whom are largely kept out of the public eye.Sunak attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. (Rishi Sunak, Instagram)His parentsYashvir Sunak, Rishi’s father, was born in Kenya. He arrived in the UK to study medicine and then stayed, becoming an NHS GP. His mother, Usha, was born in Tanzania and is a pharmacist.The couple met in Britain and settled in Southampton in the 1970s. Usha is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.His educationAs a teenager Sunak studied at Winchester College where he was, he says, a self-confessed “geek”. According to a recent biography, the “naughtiest” thing the prime minister did during his school days “was to smuggle a hand-held television into the school so that he did not miss any key games of Euro 96”.The childhood home of Rishi Sunak in Southampton. (Getty Images, photo taken in 2022)Perhaps unsurprisingly for someone with such an unblemished record, he went on to become the school’s head boy. Sunak worked while studying, delivering medicines for his mother’s pharmacy and as a waiter at a local Indian restaurant.After school, Sunk read philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, graduating in 2001 with a first class degree. While still at university he held an internship at the Conservative Party campaign headquarters and joined the party, but went on studying before entering politics.He earned his MBA from Stanford in 2006 as a Fulbright Scholar, meaning he was selected among the most promising candidates from the UK.How much is he worth?As prime minister, Rishi Sunak earns £80,807 on top of a salary of £84,144 for being an MP. But his current income from Westminster pales in comparison to his family’s vast wealth through marriage.The Sunday Times valued the couple’s joint fortune at £730m. Murty's father is the co-founder of Infosys, an Indian tech conglomerate, in which she holds shares estimated at around £430m. Her family is also involved in a £900m business arrangement with Amazon in India, and she is a shareholder of multiple other companies.Rishi Sunak's mother is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.Before entering politics Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and a series of hedge funds. He is also known to have invested in blind trusts, in which investments are made without holders knowing where the funds are located. These arrangements reportedly hold Sunak’s own multi-million-pound fortune.His religionSunak is not only the first prime minister of colour and of Indian heritage but he is also the first practising Hindu to hold the biggest job in UK politics.He has spoken of his pride in his Hindu faith, saying, “that’s how I was raised, and that’s how I am”. He said: “Having faith gives you resilience, gives you strength that is important and it provides an outlook on life which I find particularly valuable.”Sunak on... the NHSThe prime minister’s biggest challenge in office has been the crisis in the NHS - and to many people in the sector his government has been found wanting. “We have not made enough progress,” Sunak said when asked about his commitment to cut NHS waiting lists during an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV. Asked if that meant he had failed, the prime minister replied: “Yes, we have.""Sunak expects to see waiting lists start to reduce this spring, and blames the delays on “industrial action”, as disputes with junior doctors and consultants over pay and conditions continue. Yet Sunak himself has been blamed for holding up a deal that would prevent more walkouts.Sunak, his wife Akshata and daughters Anoushka and Krishna (second left) at Santa Monica Pier, California, on their summer holiday in 2023. (AP)Sunak on… immigrationAccording to the prime minister, illegal migration threatens to “overwhelm” Europe. In June 2023 he claimed his plan to “stop the boats” and tackle illegal immigration was working, but by August 2023 he had changed his mind: “It’s not an easy problem to fix,” he told broadcasters. “I never said we would be able to solve it overnight.”He has staked much of his reputation on the government's Rwanda Bill - his plan to deport asylum seekers to the east African country that finally became law last month, after months of legal and procedural challenges. It has paved the way for deportation flights to get off the ground within weeks.He described his policy, which he says will act as a deterrent to people traffickers, as being “the will of the people” – yet polling suggests low support for such a punitive approach.The policy, coupled with Conservative talk of limits on legal migration, shows that the government is committed to taking a hard line on the issue, despite the risk of alienating more moderate voters.The Rwanda policy is not universally popular. (YouGov)Sunak on... the cost of living crisisThe prime minister has told hard-pressed working families that they will feel some relief from the cost of living crisis as inflation continues to drop following its highs of October 2022. He described the government’s tax cuts as “meaningful” and has welcomed the dip in mortgage rates at the turn of the year.Sunak says falling inflation will have the biggest impact on family budgets “and will start to ease some of those pressures” and that he was right to focus on that figure. However, the global drop in energy prices is probably the biggest factor in easing the hit on wallets - something that the prime minister has no control over.However, the fall in inflation to 2.3% on 22 May this year – the lowest it has been in nearly three years – was likely one of the key factors in persuading Sunak to call a snap election many weeks earlier than experts had predicted.Can we expect more handouts or tax breaks to help balance family budgets? Not according to Sunak, who has warned voters that it’s time to “move on” from government support.Sunak on... pensionsThe triple-lock pensions policy is a tricky one for Sunak – especially since Labour has committed to retaining the policy. Any change to a policy that has become a hallmark of recent Conservative governments would not go down well with the 12 million pensioners it would likely impact – many of whom are lifelong Tory voters.Last November, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said pensions should start being pegged to an average of inflation and wage growth, which would help reduce state spending over time.Sunak’s response to that was ambiguous to say the least: “We are the government that has … delivered the triple lock and it is why, right now, pensions are, depending on how you look at it, £800 or £900 bigger than they otherwise would have been.” He is yet to confirm whether it will appear in the manifesto."
The Independent,Keir Starmer blasts Sunak’s leadership over ‘failure to grasp the nettle’ on election betting scandal,[],"Geordie Greig,David Maddox and Kate Devlin",26 June 2024 at 8:18 am·6-min read,26,June,2024,08:18:00,6,"Sir Keir Starmer has taken aim at Rishi Sunak’s leadership ability over the election date betting scandal, accusing the prime minister of “failing to grasp the nettle” and take action quickly enough.The Labour leader’s taunts came on the day that Mr Sunak finally agreed to suspend the candidates, two weeks after the allegations first emerged. The scandal continued to deepen on Tuesday when Scotland Yard confirmed that five more police officers were alleged to have placed bets on the timing of the general election. The Met said it had been passed information on the allegations by the Gambling Commission.Speaking to The Independent, Sir Keir insisted that, had Labour candidates been involved in allegedly trying to use insider information to make bets, they “would have been straight out of the door” and their “feet wouldn’t have touched the ground”.Just a few hours after the interview, the Labour leader made good on his words, suspending Central Suffolk and North Ipswich candidate Kevin Craig after being told he was also being investigated by the Gambling Commission. Sir Keir also handed back Mr Craig’s £100,000 donation to the party.The Labour leader made it clear that the final week of the election campaign would be about character and leadership, and who is best placed to make the tough decisions in government.Sir Keir’s attack on the prime minister had echoes of the 2010 campaign, when Gordon Brown was described as “frit” by David Cameron as he headed towards defeat.Starmer, pictured discussing knife crime with actor Idris Elba on Tuesday, has been critical of the prime minister’s handling of the betting scandal (PA Wire)Craig Williams, the candidate for Montgomeryshire, was Mr Sunak’s parliamentary private secretary, and Laura Saunders, the candidate for Bristol North West, has worked for the party since 2015. Her husband, Tony Lee, has taken leave of absence from his role as the Tory director of campaigns, after he too came under investigation by the Gambling Commission.Sir Keir spoke of his anger at the scandal that has tainted British politics over the last two weeks, and questioned the length of time it took for Mr Sunak to take action.“It’s a failure to grasp the nettle,” he said. “It’s I don't know how many days after the first admission – I think it’s 13 days, and certainly a good week and a bit since [it first broke]. If they had been my candidates, they’d have been straight out of the door and their feet wouldn’t have touched the floor, but to wait a week, to make excuses like that, is inexcusable.”The Labour leader himself has been accused of being slow to take action against candidates in the past, including during the Rochdale by-election in April, when Labour’s candidate Azhar Ali was suspended for repeating conspiracy theories about Israel that claimed the country had orchestrated the Hamas terrorist attacks on 7 October.Mr Ali’s words were first put to Labour on a Saturday and broke in the evening. After Labour attempted to defend the decision not to suspend their candidate on the Sunday political shows, further accusations were put to the party on the Monday, and he was then suspended.Sir Keir said this showed that he and his party had acted quickly in comparison to Mr Sunak and the Tories.The Conservatives have withdrawn their support for Craig Williams, the former candidate for Montgomeryshire (PA Media)“I think the issue blew up on the Sunday, and [Mr Ali] was gone by the Monday,” he said. “That was a by-election, where we were drawing the only candidate in the by-election, where basically we had to concede the by-election.”Sir Keir’s comments came as Mr Williams, who has admitted placing a bet on the date of the election, defended himself after his suspension. He said he had “committed an error of judgement, not an offence” and added that he intended to clear his name.But public anger over the issue was highlighted by an opinion poll that showed increasing support for the idea that those who gambled on the election date should be barred from standing as candidates.Almost two-thirds (63 per cent) of the UK public said that candidates who placed bets on the date of the general election should not be allowed to stand, in research by Savanta conducted from 21 to 24 June, before the Conservative Party announced that it had withdrawn its support.Savanta’s research has underlined the challenges the prime minister faces, with over half (54 per cent) of Conservative voters saying that the candidates shouldn’t have been allowed to stand.It came as Scottish Secretary Alister Jack insisted that a claim he made, that he had won £2,000 betting on a July election, had been a joke.He said in a statement: “Following reports today I want to be absolutely clear I have not breached any gambling rules. I placed two unsuccessful bets on the date of the general election and one successful one.“I put two bets on in March of £5 each for an election to be held in May and June respectively. In April, I put £20 at 5 to 1 on an election being held between July and September. I had no knowledge of the date of the election until the day it was called. As I have said previously, I placed no bets in May and am not under investigation by the Gambling Commission.”Shortly after the prime minister called the election, he told the BBC he had made £2,100 after betting on June and July election dates.Rishi Sunak’s leadership is again under question (EPA)Mr Sunak had withstood days of mounting calls to suspend those caught up in the row, with Northern Ireland minister Steve Baker the latest senior Tory to call for action.In a bid to head off criticism, the prime minister announced on Monday that the Conservatives were conducting their own inquiry into the row. But a day later, the party said that “as a result of ongoing internal enquiries” it could no longer support either candidate.Mr Williams – who, as Mr Sunak’s parliamentary private secretary, was one of the prime minister’s closest aides – appeared to admit having placed a bet on the election date just days before the Tory leader announced it, saying he had made a “huge error of judgement”.Despite being ditched by their party, both Mr Williams, who is standing in Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr, and Ms Saunders, the former candidate for Bristol North West, will still appear on ballot papers, as the deadline to change these has passed.Mr Baker piled pressure on Mr Sunak on Monday when he told ITV: “I would call them up and ask them, ‘Did you do it?’ And if they did it, then they are suspended.“But the prime minister would have to answer why he hasn’t done it. I haven’t got inside information on why the prime minister hasn’t done it.”The Northern Ireland minister joined senior Tories including Tobias Ellwood, who also called for the two candidates to be suspended.After the announcement, Conservative former cabinet minister David Frost tweeted: “We get there in the end. But why did it take so long to come to a decision that seemed so necessary right from the start?”Others said to be involved in the Gambling Commission inquiry include the party’s chief data officer Nick Mason, who has taken a leave of absence from CCHQ.A close protection officer for the prime minister has also been suspended by the Metropolitan Police and is being investigated."
The Independent,Four arrests at Rishi Sunak’s house after man filmed leaving ‘parting gift’ dirty protest in his lake,[],Tom Barnes,25 June 2024 at 3:55 pm·2-min read,25,June,2024,03:55:00,2,"Four men have been arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass at Rishi Sunak’s constituency home, as video appears to show an intruder carrying out a dirty protest in a lake at the property.The men were detained at around 12.40pm on Tuesday before being escorted off the prime minister’s property in Kirby Sigston, North Yorkshire Police said.The force added that the men included one 52-year-old from London, one 43-year-old from Bolton, one 21-year-old from Manchester, and one 20-year-old from Chichester.They remain in police custody and inquiries are ongoing.A video has been released by protest group Youth Demand showing a young man entering the Prime Minister’s property and appearing to defecate in a lake.The group said the action was a “parting gift” for the Prime Minister and the Conservative government.In a press release, the group identified the man in the video as Oliver, 21, a student from Manchester, and included a statement from him.“We have so much to thank the Tories for: from crumbling schools, s*** in the rivers and a collapsing NHS; to creating a nation with more food banks than McDonalds and 4.3 million UK children living in poverty,” he said.“From allowing their mates to get filthy rich from selling weapons to battle-test on toddlers in Gaza, or by drilling for more oil as the world burns – it’s quite a legacy!”Youth Demand describes itself as a campaign calling for an arms embargo on Israel, as well as for the Government to revoke all new oil and gas licences granted since 2021.Earlier this year the Prime Minister condemned the group after it staged a demonstration outside the home of Labour leader Keir Starmer.The demonstrators hung a banner outside Sir Keir’s house that read: “Starmer stop the killing” surrounded by red hand prints.It is not the first time the prime minister’s home has been targeted by protesters.In August last year four Greenpeace protesters were arrested and charged with criminal damage after allegedly climbing on to the roof of Mr Sunak’s home in Kirby Sigston.His west London home was subject to a demonstration by Just Stop Oil in November last year."
The Independent,Angela Rayner forced to abandon Glastonbury plans as Labour ordered to skip festival ahead of election,[],David Maddox,26 June 2024 at 9:00 am·3-min read,26,June,2024,09:00:00,3,"Labour has told its staff that nobody can take time off this weekend to go to Glastonbury even with the party holding a huge lead in the polls.An insider confirmed “there’s a three line whip” on everyone not to go to Glastonbury this year with the final week of campaignng about to begin. Even Labour’s deputy leader Angela Rayner has been forced to abandon her plans to go to the music festival with headliners Coldplay, Shania Twain, SZA and Dua Lipa.The festival which once echoed to “Oh Jeremy Corbyn” has become another symbol of “No Jeremy Corbyn” from a party which has expelled its former leader in a ruthless charge to regain power.People arriving at Glastonbury on Wednesday - but Labour staffers are not allowed (Getty Images)Instead staff who have been working day and night in Labour’s swanky offices in Southwark just south of the Thames will be redeployed to “key marginals” in the next 48 hours.“Now the manifesto is done there is less for people to do here and we need boots on the ground in target seats,” The Independent was told on a visit to the headquarters.There is some discussion over what “target seats” now means with the way the polls now suggest that constituencies which once seemed out of reach and impossible now being within reach. A sign of that was the decision by Rishi Sunak to spend more time in his Richmond and Northallerton seat in Yorkshire because of the danger of being the first sitting prime minister to lose his constituency in an election.Deputy party leader Angela Rayner had been due to attend the festival (PA)The revelation came on a visit by The Independent to the sprawling open plan office where the ruthless Labour operation has planned its election victory.Only Sir Keir Starmer has his own small office with different “departments” nestling next to one another across the expanse.The area is littered with diet coke cans, bottles of high energy power drinks and half eaten oranges in a clear sign on what has fuelled Labour’s march to power over the last few weeks.But with the policy teams work now done the floor is now emptying as they are bussed off to different parts of the UK to make sure the poll predictions of a massive victory come true.“Not many actual votes have been cast yet and we cannot take anything for granted.”There are other signs of what has helped motivate this winning team apart from the discount on drinks offer at a nearby pub.A plastic model of Liz Truss looks down on people near to the main entrance to the operation perhaps as a constant reminder of the “mini budget” that dashed Tory hopes of a revival. Ms Truss has featured on many of Labour’s campaign messages, not least the question about why Rishi sunak permitted her to be a candidate.Labour have a hope of picking up her Norfolk South West seat which seems to be vulnerable for the first time in history.But while the abiding message in the 2024 campaign has been “change” - change from Jeremy Corbyn, change for the country - there is a giant reminder of Labour’s socialist roots.A poster from the 1910 election - well before Labour was a proper national force and the two main parties with the Liberals and the Tories - dominates the room close to Sir Keir’s office.With marching workers it proclaims: “Forward! The day is breaking”.Campaign manager Morgan McSweeney can be seen pacing around nervously but there is an air of confidence in the room that after 14 years of irrelevance Labour is back and about to seize power again.A room filled with light and determination seems to reflect the end of a long dark chapter in Labour history. Who needs Glastonbury when you can almost taste victory?"
Sky News,Labour candidate Kevin Craig suspended after betting against himself,[],Sky News,Updated 25 June 2024 at 5:07 pm·4-min read,25,June,2024,05:07:00,4,"A Labour candidate has been suspended by the party after betting against himself - with the Gambling Commission launching an investigation into him.Kevin Craig is running to become the MP for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich - a safe Conservative seat previously held by ex-Tory Dan Poulter, who defected to Labour ahead of the election and is not standing again.Sky News' chief political correspondent Jon Craig understands the bet was relating to the outcome of the vote in his constituency - and the candidate had actually been betting he would lose the contest.Politics live: Dropped Tory candidate vows to 'clear name'Labour confirmed Kevin Craig had been suspended by the party - though at this late stage, he will still appear on the ballot paper with ""Labour"" next to his name.It is also understood that the party will return £100,000 in donations to the businessman that he has made since Sir Keir Starmer took charge of Labour.Posting on X, Mr Craig said he had ""enjoyed the odd bet for fun"" throughout his life, adding: ""A few weeks ago when I thought I would never win this seat I put a bet on the Tories to win here with the intention of giving any winnings to local charities.""While I did not place this bet with any prior knowledge of the outcome, this was a huge mistake, for which I apologise unreservedly.""He said he had ""so much respect"" for Sir Keir and it was ""right that the party upholds the highest standards for its parliamentary candidates - just as the public expects the highest standards from any party hoping to serve in government"".Mr Craig also said he would ""comply fully"" with the Gambling Commission's investigation and apologised to his local Labour team, adding: ""I deeply regret what I have done and will take the consequences of this stupid error of judgement on the chin.""A Labour Party spokesperson said: ""With [Sir] Keir Starmer as leader, the Labour Party upholds the highest standards for our parliamentary candidates, as the public rightly expects from any party hoping to serve, which is why we have acted immediately in this case.""The incident comes after two Conservative candidates were suspended by their party for allegedly placing bets on when the election date would be.Those allegations first emerged almost two weeks ago, with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak saying he would wait for the outcome of the Gambling Commission's inquiry before acting.However, in a U-turn announced this morning, both candidates have now been suspended - though again the Conservative Party name will still appear on ballot papers.Two Tory party officials and an officer from Mr Sunak's close protection team are also being investigated by the Gambling Commission over the placing of bets on the timing of the election.And later on Tuesday, another Conservative politician was also revealed to be under investigation by the commission - Welsh MS Russell George.A statement from the leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew RT Davies, said Mr George would step back from his role as the party's deputy chief whip in the Senedd while the investigation is ongoing.Scotland Secretary Alister Jack has denied any wrongdoing after reports he had made more than £2,000 by betting on the timing of the election.He told Sky News: ""I am very clear that I have never, on any occasion, broken any Gambling Commission rules. Specifically, I did not place any bets on the date of the general election during May (the period under investigation by the Gambling Commission). Furthermore, I am not aware of any family or friends placing bets.""""And for the avoidance of doubt that based on my comment above, the Gambling Commission have obviously not contacted me.""Mr Craig is the founder and chief executive of marketing and PR agency PLMR, with the company's website describing him as ""an expert in political communications, crisis management, and corporate communications"".He also served as a Labour councillor for 17 years in London.A full list of the candidates running for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich is below:Charlie Caiger, independent;Tony Gould, Reform UK;Mike Hallatt, independent;Brett Alistair Mickelburgh, Lib Dems;Dan Pratt, Greens;Patrick Spencer, Conservatives."
The Telegraph,Keir Starmer is about to kill the Brexit dream for good,[],Martin Howe,26 June 2024 at 9:28 am·5-min read,26,June,2024,09:28:00,5,"Sir Keir Starmer and his Labour team enjoy warm cuddly feelings about the European Union. Although Starmer has ruled out returning to the customs union or the EU’s single market, Labour says that it will improve the UK’s relationship with the EU by negotiating a veterinary agreement to reduce border checks and seeking mutual recognition agreements allowing touring artists and professionals to export their services to the EU.But what is equally clear is that Labour’s feelings about the EU are not reciprocated. Labour’s overtures were met with a brutal put-down from EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier. He warned that the EU will block Labour’s plan to improve the terms of Brexit as “cherry picking”, unless the UK accepts the full obligations of the single market, including free movement of workers. Barnier’s intervention highlights a truth which is apparent to everyone, except, for some reason, to those who still hanker for a step by step return to EU membership. The EU is not interested in improving trade with its neighbours as an end in itself. What it wants is to use trade terms as a carrot and stick to force its neighbours into following product standards and rules dictated by Brussels.The EU has achieved near total compliance with its single market rules by the EEA countries Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Switzerland has put up more of a fight against the EU’s attempts to impose control on it, but still has to follow EU rules in many areas and to accept the free movement of workers.This is what makes negotiating about trade with the EU much more difficult and dangerous than negotiating with other trading partners around the world. They will agree to things like mutual recognition if they think it makes trading sense from their point of view, for example by allowing their professionals to export their services into the UK market in return for giving access to professionals from the UK.But the EU will also demand control over the UK’s own rules as part of the price of this kind of arrangement. In return for mutual recognition of professional qualifications, it will demand that UK professions comply with the rules laid down in the EU’s own directives. In return for a seemingly innocuous veterinary agreement to ease border checks on meat, it will demand that the UK comply with the whole panoply of the EU’s own ossified veterinary medicines law.Most worryingly, Rachel Reeve has suggested that Labour would seek mutual recognition for bankers and financial services workers, which would open the door to Brussels reimposing some of its anti-competitive rules from which the City has only just been freed.Aligning with EU rules over which we have no control is extremely damaging. We have no vote on future changes to them, which will be made in the EU’s interests and not in ours. This negates democracy and our right to control our own laws. It prevents us from innovating and improving the competitiveness of our economy, and can also interfere with our trade deals around the world with other countries who regard many Brussels rules as protectionist barriers against their own exports.Starmer’s and Reeve’s comments about trying to negotiate with the EU to improve the terms of Brexit reveal their naivety about the EU and its objectives. Their attempt will either fail altogether in the face of the EU’s demands – probably the most likely outcome – but if they do a deal, it is likely to involve a very heavy price in loss of independence and control in return for modest trade benefits.But Labour would only be following more overtly and enthusiastically a route already embarked on surreptitiously by Rishi Sunak and his government. Last year he abandoned Liz Truss’s Northern Ireland Protocol Bill which had been passed by the House of Commons and would have solved the problem of EU laws applying in Northern Ireland. Instead he agreed the so-called Windsor Framework, which entrenched the EU’s control over all laws relating to goods in Northern Ireland, in return for some narrow and limited easings on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.It is not only Northern Ireland which is affected. Jeremy Hunt was unable to increase the VAT registration threshold for the whole of the UK by more than a paltry £5000, because of the EU’s VAT rules which apply in Northern Ireland. And as part of the government’s deal to get the DUP back into power sharing, it agreed to limit divergences between the rules relating to goods in Great Britain and EU rules, in order to avoid further barriers to trade across the Irish Sea inside the United Kingdom.Of course, there is nothing wrong with preventing barriers to trade inside the UK, but this should be done by freeing Northern Ireland from EU rules, not by shadowing EU rules across the whole of the UK.So the choice is between Labour which enthuses about easing trade with the EU, an innocuous objective in its own right, but is naïvely willing to cede hard-won control over our laws back to the EU. The Conservatives, whose record over the past two years is one of tying the UK deeper into aligning with EU laws, despite their protestations of delivering Brexit. Reform which promises to axe all remaining EU laws and scrap the Windsor Framework. Or of course the Liberal Democrats, who have a longer term objective of returning to EU membership."

The term is also sometimes used to refer to the election itself, as in ‘they could not win at the ballot box’.CampaignThe time before an election in which politicians persuade people to vote for them. In the case of the 2024 election in the UK, parliament was dissolved on the 30 May and the election will take place on 4 July.CanvassingGoing round a particular area trying to persuade people to vote for one party or the other.In UK elections, this is often done by volunteers knocking on people’s doors.Capital gains taxCapital gains tax is a tax on profit when people sell assets that have increased in value.In the 2024 election, the Conservatives have promised that landlords who sell to sitting tenants will be spared capital gains tax on the proceeds, while Labour has left the door open to raising capital gains.Child benefitChild benefit is a benefit paid to parents with children under 16 (or under 20 in approved education or training).The Conservatives have promised to increase the threshold at which high earners start to lose the benefit from £60,000 to £120,000.Sir Keir Starmer, like the Conservatives, has pledged not to raise VAT.

For example, both the 2010 election and 2017 elections resulted in hung parliament.In 2010, the Conservatives formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, while in 2017, the Conservatives formed a minority government with a 'confidence and supply' agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).Income tax thresholdThe thresholds between the tax-free allowance, basic rate tax and higher rates of tax.Both parties have said they will continue the freeze on income tax thresholds brought in under the Conservatives, which means people pay more tax as more and more people are pushed into higher tax brackets if wages rise.MajorityA party with a majority – more than half of the seats in the House of Commons – has won the election.The number of votes by which an individual MP wins a constituency is also referred to as their majority.ManifestoPolitical parties publish manifestos before a general election, with a set of policies that the party stands for and aims to implement if elected.Manifesto pledges are not legally binding.Marginal seatA seat in which the incumbent MP won by a small majority, meaning a swing is more likely than in a so-called ‘safe seat’ where the MP had a large majority.Net zeroThe UK Government has set a goal for Britain’s emissions to reach net zero – where emission and removal of greenhouse gases reaches equilibrium – by 2050.All major parties are expected to stick to this goal, barring Reform UK.Opinion pollAn opinion poll is a research survey (usually carried out on a representative sample of the electorate) to gauge likely results in an election.Poll‘The polls’ refers to the places where people vote in an election: exit polls and opinion polls refer to two kinds of survey used to predict election results.Postal voteAn absentee vote where the vote is sent in by post.At the 2019 general election, 17.2% of voters across the UK used a postal ballot.Proxy voteA vote where a person who can’t make it to the booth appoints someone to vote for them.In the 2019 election, 0.6% of voters appointed a proxy.PsephologyPsephology is the scientific study of elections and voting and is used to predict and analyse election results.Polling dayThe day when the country places their vote: in the UK 2024 election, this is July 4.PurdahBefore British elections, the country enters purdah, officially known as the ‘pre-election period of sensitivity’.Purdah means that politicians (both local and national) and other people such as civil servants face restrictions on what they can do and announce.Ministers who remain in office can’t announce new funding, or new policies, or anything which might sway voters or make the government more popular.The idea is that public money cannot be spent on the election.Spoiled ballotA ballot paper which has been marked wrongly (for instance with a vote for more than one candidate) will not be counted.Sometimes people spoil ballots deliberately as a protest vote to show dissatisfactionSwing‘Swing’ is the change in voter support for a political party between one election and the next.It is used to analyse the performance of parties in different areas.Tax burdenThe tax burden refers to the total amount of taxes paid by a group (in this case the UK as a whole) as a proportion of total income.The tax burden is currently at its highest in 70 years according to the OECD.The Equality ActThe 2010 Equality Act protects people against discrimination in Britain.The Conservatives want to ‘tweak’ the Act so that sex-based protections only apply on the basis of someone’s biological sex.Triple lockThe triple lock is a guarantee introduced to the state pension in 2010 so it would not lose value in real terms.The guarantee means that the state pension will rise by the highest out of average earnings, inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) or 2.5%.Triple lock plusThe ‘triple lock plus’ is a Conservative policy, which would see the tax-free pension allowance rise every year in line with the triple lock of average wages, inflation, or 2.5% – whichever is highest, to prevent pensioners being pulled into paying income tax.TurnoutTurnout refers to the percentage of people eligible to vote who turn out to vote on election day.In the 2019 election, for example, 67.3% of those eligible turned out to vote.VATValue added tax is added to goods and services sold by VAT-registered companies, and is the third-largest source of government income after income tax and national insurance.Both Labour and the Conservatives have pledged not to raise VAT.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

We missed the world wars; enjoyed the benefits of a functional and free NHS; partied in the 1960s; and we have a triple-lock pension. Tuition fees? We were paid to party at university! And we own more than 75% of the private housing stock in the country, making homes unaffordable for young families.What has our generation bequeathed to the succeeding generations? Unaffordable homes, Brexit, polluted waters and toxic air. It’s time to make amends for our selfishness and bequeath a better Britain – and a better world – to our children.A criterion for deciding who to vote for on 4 July would be to use the Nolan principles of public office: selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership.

The Guardian,‘Normal politics won’t stop it’: housing crisis dominates election in Hitchin,[],Robert Booth Social affairs correspondent,26 June 2024 at 7:48 am·8-min read,26,June,2024,07:48:00,8,"The green belt around Hitchin has rarely looked greener. A chlorophyll-friendly cycle of pouring rain and blazing sunshine has left the landscapes of this Hertfordshire-Bedfordshire constituency throbbing with midsummer life.But these open fields and stands of oak are at the heart of the issue vexing so many voters here in this general election: how to crack the housing crisis.Hitchin, a mostly rural constituency 35 minutes by rail from central London and newly formed from three previously Conservative seats, is under huge housing pressure. The green belt is being eyed up not just by developers but political parties, too.Private rents are up 36% since the last general election five years ago, according to Zoopla. House prices are up 13% despite interest rate rises. If Labour and the Conservatives are to meet their respective pledges to build 1.5m and 1.6m new homes in the next parliament, then constituencies such as Hitchin will need to find room.But already pressures are high. Thousands of people have moved from London since the pandemic pricing out local young people. Many alighted on the historic town of Hitchin, which now has 60 places to buy coffee and, since last September, a branch of the gift and lifestyle store Oliver Bonas – a sure sign that plenty of residents have a healthy disposable income.Canvassing in one of the town wards this month, Alistair Strathern, the Labour candidate, spoke to seven households in one street who had recently arrived from north-east London – three from the same borough of Waltham Forest.There’s a Brick Lane Bagel stall and a shop selling puppucinos (that’s cappuccinos for dogs). On the town square, the jewellers Gatwards might have seen sales of £1,000 pieces fall amid the cost of living crisis – but big ticket purchases over £10,000 are up. The owner is having a refurb to install a bar to cater to the high-rollers.“The local population has to compete with the effect of gentrification caused by people moving here from London,” said Jack Taylor, 31, a charity director who is among the many struggling to buy. “Everyone born in Hitchin or Stevenage is moving farther afield as they just can’t afford it.”Voters also get frustrated about congested roads, patchy rail services, overwhelmed GPs and stretched schools. A place that was a pressure valve for London’s housing crisis is itself starting to boil over.In common with much of England, housebuilding has been slowing down in recent decades. In North Hertfordshire district it has almost halved in the 15 years since the global financial crisis. The average waiting time for a three-bed house for social rent in Hitchin is now nearly four years.The London arrivals have also changed the social mix. Selling paper plates at the outdoor market, John Haykin, a Hitchin resident of 45 years, said the town had “lost a lot of community in the last five to 10 years”.Music and food festivals in the town have an atmosphere “like a London borough”, said Tom Hardy, 34, the town centre manager.But as the candidates – Strathern for Labour, Bim Afolami for the Conservatives and Chris Lucas for the Liberal Democrats – canvass in a tight race, few voters trust they have the answer.Dave, 36, an insurance worker, moved to Hitchin from London so he could afford to buy a £200,000 one-bed flat. Now he wants to move in with his partner and the cost of a two-bed flat here means they must consider moving farther afield again.“I can’t see any political party getting to grips with the housing crisis,” he said. “It seems to have a force behind it that normal politics won’t be able to stop.”One answer could be to concrete over more fields. But after decades of identikit estates being built on farmland by volume housebuilders, opposition to “sprawl” is widespread.On the western boundary of the constituency, North Hertfordshire district council has agreed to remove enough land from the green belt to build 2,100 homes. This Luton overspill will surround a cluster of historic rural villages, woodland, bridleways and hiking paths – what the villagers call their “green lung”.Interactive“Rishi [Sunak] has said [he’ll protect the green belt], [Micheal] Gove has said it, but they don’t do it,” said Dave Harris, a villager. “This is a classic example. This whole process has made me despondent about UK politics.”If it wins next week, Labour is promising to speed up planning and to take chunks out of the grey belt (environmentally poor green belt). But the mood in Hitchin suggests Keir Starmer would be wise not to ignore the risk of another shires rebellion of the kind that thwarted Boris Johnson’s 2021 attempts to ease planning controls.On the eastern constituency border, there is disquiet where a 700-home estate is planned at Highover Farm. It will move the boundary of Hitchin town to within a few hundred metres of nearby Letchworth.“You might as well build a cathedral and call it a city,” said Liz, 63, a nurse who lives next door to the planned estate. She fears the family homes won’t help the young people priced out of Hitchin or those in need of social housing and will be sold to people out of the area.Trust that new housing developments will be accompanied by better roads, enough schools and GP surgeries is shot.The Priory school, the town’s 1,200-pupil comprehensive, is already losing three teachers this year who won’t be replaced and some classes have up to 32 pupils, says the headteacher, Geraint Edwards.Special educational needs provision in the area is under huge pressure. And then there is the constant headache of the service on the rail link to London, with almost a third of trains operated by Govia Thameslink running late.Labour’s big idea is new towns, which, if delivered, would be the first since the 1970s. The idea has support in Hitchin, not least as Ebenezer Howard’s original 1903 garden city of Letchworth lies just over the constituency border. The policy at least holds out the promise of confined rather than sprawling housebuilding.But the hard question is where? Asked in between door knocks if he would accept a new town in the constituency, Strathern said only that his party would “come forward with a really sensible framework for engaging communities, not just here, but right across the country, on where the best places for new towns would be”.InteractiveAfolami, the Conservative candidate and Treasury minister who held the now defunct Hitchin and Harpenden seat, said voters were right to be “really unhappy with how poorly managed, in terms of local infrastructure, the housing has been”. This was an “indictment of how the council have done things” but he conceded it was also legitimate to “criticise the Conservative government over the last 13 years for not wielding a heavier stick on how councils and developers interact and making sure the infrastructure comes in first”.New towns, he said, were “obviously a good idea” but “the difficulty is where they go”.And to complete the noncommittal picture, the Lib Dem candidate, Lucas, was supportive “in principle” but said: “You can’t just magic up a place for new towns.”No one seems to want to grasp the nettle before polling day.And even when new houses are built, there are problems. Strathern has been campaigning on the Campton Fields estate, built recently in the north of the constituency. Freeholders have been dismayed at facing a combined £34,000 annual charges from private firms to manage the roads, pavements and play areas because they have not been adopted yet by the council. Weeds sprout from the pavements. It is a bizarre situation that Strathern calls “fleecehold”.But building is not the only solution. At Letchworth Citizens Advice, a renter named Stuart, 35, could be found pleading for emergency cash for food after falling £3,400 in rent arrears.His debts were caused by zero-hours contracts in warehouses and manufacturing companies. Employers keep laying him off after a few months so he doesn’t accrue employment rights, leading to periods without wages.The number of people with housing problems seeking help at the bureau is up 62% on last year. Insecure work is a common issue.defaultIn this relatively affluent constituency with higher than average levels of employment, wages and higher education, you hear concerns about Labour’s “vindictive” plan to levy VAT on private schools. There are calls for more defence spending than Labour is offering. Sample responses to Starmer include: “not strong enough”, “a good man”, “a nothing person”. It could be close on 4 July.Taken overall, the mood is one of antipathy towards the Conservatives but only lukewarm enthusiasm for Labour. Whoever wins will find much to do in Hitchin."
Yahoo News UK,"Will Nigel Farage's Reform UK 'beat' the Tories in the election?With some polling figures putting the Tories and Reform UK nearly neck and neck, could Farage's party really end up with nearly as many MPs as Sunak's?","['What do the latest polls say?', 'Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?', 'Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?', 'What is proportional representation?']",James Cheng-Morris and  Ellen Manning,Updated 14 June 2024 at 6:33 am·7-min read,14,June,2024,06:33:00,7,"Leading pollster John Curtice has poured cold water on suggestions that Reform UK is now beating the Conservative Party in the general election polls.As representatives from seven parties took prepared to take part in a TV debate on Thursday, a YouGov survey for The Times newspaper said Reform’s support had increased by two points to 19%, putting them ahead of the Tories for the first time.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage took the the opportunity to hail the poll results in the debate, declaring: “We are now the opposition to Labour.”But Curtice urged caution, insisting that single polls should not be relied on. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""This is one poll - we’ve actually, I think, had four other polls published in the last 24 hours - none of which have had Reform ahead, not even all of which have had Reform gaining ground, but quite a couple of them certainly suggesting it’s also got very close.""He said it may not be the case that Reform are ahead - and could be on average four or five points behind. But he said: ""This is still bad news for the Conservatives. The only way Rishi Sunak can hope to get even to base camp in narrowing the lead that Labour have started off with this campaign was to squeeze the Reform vote.""He added: ""Rather than making progress, things are actually going backwards, not least of course because of Nigel Farage’s decision to fight this campaign.""With many speculating that Reform UK with Farage at the helm could ""beat"" the Tories, Yahoo News UK takes a look.What do the latest polls say?YouGov’s voting intention tracker, updated on Tuesday, suggests the Tories and Reform UK are neck and neck.With Labour well ahead on 38%, the Tories are trailing on 18% – compared to a high of 53% under Boris Johnson in 2020 – with Reform UK just behind on 17% and the Liberal Democrats on 15%.However, there are multiple polls taking place at any one time by a number of different companies.According to the PA news agency, an average of all polls that were carried out wholly or partly during the seven days to June 13 puts Labour on 43%, 21 points ahead of the Conservatives on 22%, followed by Reform on 14%, the Lib Dems on 10% and the Greens on 6%.And while Reform’s average is up one percentage point on the figure for the previous week and the Tories are down one point, there is still an eight-point gap, on average, between the two.Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?Unless something remarkable happens, in short: 'No' - and that's because of the first past the post (FPTP) voting system in which the candidate with the largest number of votes in their constituency is elected.According to the Electoral Reform Society, which is against FPTP, this system leads to a situation where “even if millions of voters support the same party, if they are thinly spread out across the UK they may only get the largest number of votes in a couple of these contests – so only win a few MPs"".“Tens of thousands of voters supporting a different party, but who live near each other, could end up with more MPs. This means the number of MPs a party has in parliament rarely matches their popularity with the public.”Rishi Sunak on the campaign trail on Wednesday. (AFP via Getty Images)Farage knows this well. As the leader of UKIP in the 2015 election, he saw his party win 12.6% of the nationwide vote and one seat. The Liberal Democrats won 7.9% of the vote... and eight seats.Indeed, YouGov last week released a poll – put together using the multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) surveying technique, from a sample size of nearly 60,000 respondents – which suggested the Tories would win just 140 seats, having won 365 in 2019. But this is still 140 more than the zero it projected Reform UK to win, in spite of its strong polling figures.The model had Reform UK ""performing strongly in a number of seats but still a long way off winning in any"", with projected second-placed finishes in 27 constituencies.YouGov's MRP projection. (YouGov)Granted, this model was formed between 24 May and 1 June, before Farage's headline-grabbing intervention on Monday last week in which he announced he would be standing as an MP.But, even as Reform UK polls closer than ever to the Tories, it's difficult to imagine the party winning more than a handful of seats.Chris Hopkins, director at polling firm Savanta, told Yahoo News UK that in one respect, Reform UK is at an advantage compared to Ukip in 2015 because ""Ukip took votes from both Labour and the Conservatives, and we are not seeing that with Reform UK – they are all coming from the Conservatives.""That is the consequence of Rishi Sunak making immigration a centrepiece of the campaign and failing to deliver on it. Even if you have voters that are neutral on immigration, they would say the small boats policy has been a disaster.""But even so, Hopkins said, Reform UK is still ""at a huge electoral disadvantage"" in that its votes are not very concentrated, they are very evenly spread.""There are going to be some races where Reform UK is strong - the Nigel Farage factor in Clacton is really interesting - but realistically its ceiling is five seats: and that’s a high ceiling.""Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey on a campaign visit in Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire, on Wednesday. (PA)Like Reform UK, Sir Ed Davey’s Liberal Democrats are performing well in the polls.In a sign of how defensive the Tory campaign is becoming, one online party advert claims voting for Reform UK or the Lib Dems could give Labour 100 extra seats, resulting in the biggest majority in its history.It depicts a scenario where the Conservatives are beaten into third place behind the Lib Dems, with just 57 seats, despite getting 19% of the vote and without Reform winning a single seat.Read more: Pollsters got it wrong in 2015, so could Labour’s lead be overestimated? (The Guardian)However, it remains unlikely the Lib Dems will finish second. YouGov’s MRP poll projected the party performing strongly, winning 48 seats. This would be up 37 from 2019, but still nowhere near the Tories’ projected 140.However, amid all this talk about projections, it’s worth remembering they are still only polls and not a definite indicator of how people will vote on 4 July. The 1992 and 2015 elections are notable examples of how polling didn’t match the end results of Tory wins.What is proportional representation?Proportional representation, as defined by the UK parliament, is an electoral system ""in which the distribution of seats corresponds closely with the proportion of the total votes cast for each party. For example, if a party gained 40% of the total votes, a perfectly proportional system would allow them to gain 40% of the seats.""This differs from the first past the post system, as set out above, in that a relatively high vote share rarely corresponds with increased seats for the smaller parties. In 2019, for example, the Lib Dems won 11.5% of the vote but only 1.7% – 11 – of the 650 seats.Unsurprisingly, both Reform UK and the Lib Dems support proportional representation.The Lib Dems this week made it part of their manifesto, with the party saying it would introduce the single transferrable vote method, a form of proportional representation which allows electors to rank their preference of candidates on the ballot.The party previously sought to change the UK’s voting system while in the coalition government under then-leader Nick Clegg, but voters rejected the plan in a 2011 referendum.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

Many also assume his title is hereditary.So what do you really need to know about the man who, on current poll ratings, is set to be the UK’s next prime minister?His early lifeKeir Starmer was born in Southwark, south London, in 1962, as the second of four children. His parents were Labour Party members and named him after Keir Hardie, the party’s first leader in parliament.The family moved out of the capital and he grew up in Hurst Green, a village just outside the small Surrey town of Oxted. He was active in youth politics from his teenage years but was also a skilled musician, taking music lessons alongside Norman Cook, who later became better known as a member of The Housemartins and the DJ Fatboy Slim.Starmer played the flute, piano, violin and recorder and was a junior exhibitioner at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.His familyStarmer is married to Victoria, a former solicitor who later retrained in occupational health and now works for the NHS. The pair met through their work in the law in the early 2000s and married in Essex in 2007.She was first seen accompanying her husband when the couple were filmed clapping for carers during the pandemic in 2020 outside their home in Camden. They have two children, a son and daughter, but both are kept out of the public eye.Victoria's father was Jewish and originally came from Poland, while her mother converted when they got married. Starmer has said in a previous interview that ""my wife in particular wants our children to know the faith of her family"" and that they ""observe some of the practices, for example Friday night prayers"".Keir Starmer with parents, Rodney and Josephine, at his graduation. (Twitter/Keir Starmer)His parentsThe Labour leader's father, Rodney Starmer, worked as a toolmaker in a factory, and his mother Josephine Starmer (née Baker), was a nurse.His father worked long, 14-hour days but spent his time outside work caring for Josephine, who was diagnosed with the autoimmune condition Still’s disease. She required two hip and knee replacements twice in her lifetime and struggled with arthritic pain.As a young man Starmer also helped care for his mother, which he has said led to him being more emotionally reserved. His sister, Katy, recalled: “He’s had to be a grown-up all his life. I’ve always been quite open about my feelings – Keir is good at most things, but not that.” Josephine Starmer died in 2015, and his father three years later.His educationStarmer passed the 11-plus examination, and attended Reigate Grammar School from age 11. While he was at the school it became an independent fee-paying institution, but as an existing student he was exempt from fees, and his tuition in the sixth form was covered by a bursary.After school he studied law at the University of Leeds, this first in his family to attend university, graduating with a first class degree in 1985. He undertook postgraduate law studied at the University of Oxford, where he served as editor of a radical magazine, Socialist Alternatives.A photograph of a younger Starmer as shown on ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories in 2021. (ITV)Why is he a sir?Stamer was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 2014 in recognition of his work in the legal profession, culminating in a five-year term as Director of Public Prosecutions.He first became a barrister in 1987 at the Middle Temple, later joining Doughty Street Chambers and was appointed a Queen’s Counsel in 2002, aged just 39. In 2008 he was appointed head of the Crown Prosecution Service and DPP.During his tenure he chose to prosecute three Labour MPs and a Conservative in the wake of the parliamentary expenses scandal, and was responsible for prosecuting former MP Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce for perverting the course of justice after Pryce claimed responsibility for her former husband’s speeding offence.Starmer on... the NHSThe Labour leader has said that, if elected, his government would “get the NHS working around the clock and pay staff properly to do it”.The remark followed a commitment to provide £1.1bn in funding for the health service to cut waiting lists by paying doctors and nurses to carry out additional out-of-hours care, which would be funded by axing tax breaks for wealthy “non-doms” who hoard money overseas. He added: “The Conservative Party that brought our NHS to its knees will put it in the ground. We have to get it back on its feet.”Starmer describes the NHS as “the crowdfunded solution for all of us”, reinforcing his commitment to healthcare being free at the point of use, but says reform is inevitable or the health service would “remain on life support”. He has pledged to integrate up-to-date technology into every part of the NHS including using artificial intelligence to diagnose disease earlier and more accurately.He supported the doctors strikes, telling ministers: “Don’t break junior doctors, talk to them. Get in the room [and] sort it out.”Starmer with his wife, Lady Victoria Starmer, at the Labour Party Conference in October 2023. (Alamy)Starmer on… immigrationThe government has “lost control of borders”, according to Labour. Starmer has said a Labour government would set up a new policy unit to tackle illegal migration and has suggested that a returns agreement for asylum seekers could be negotiated with the European Union to solve the small boats crisis.He described the government’s thwarted Rwanda plan, which would see illegal migrants deported to the African nation but has to be put into practice due to legal blocks, as a “gimmick” and a “farce” and has promised to reverse it.Starmer on... the cost of living crisisStarmer has sought to keep Rishi Sunak’s handling of the cost of living crisis in the minds of voters by claiming that “his fingerprints are all over their struggling household budgets”. In a letter to his shadow cabinet, leaked to The Guardian, he wrote: “Rishi Sunak is the chief architect of choices prioritising the wealthiest and of the government’s failure to get a grip of the economy and get growth going.”He has said he would prioritise tackling inflation, blaming it for putting up prices and eroding household savings, but has pledged to “take the difficult and responsible decisions” to bring it down.Starmer pictured in 2010, when he was director of public prosecution at the CPS, making a statement about MPs who face charges over their expenses claims. (Getty)Starmer on... private schoolsLabour has dropped its early promise to scrap charitable status for private schools, but has committed to levying a 20% VAT rate on school fees removing their “unfair tax break”. The money raised, he said, will be used to address the “appalling state” of the school system for all children.“It’s not an attack on private schools. It’s just saying an exemption you have had is going to go,” he warned private schools who have been critical of the plan – reminding them they are not obliged to pass that tax on to parents in the form of increased fees.Starmer on… the House of LordsWhen he was first Labour leader, Starmer proposed a “root and branch reform of the centre of government… rooting out unearned privilege and addressing unaccountable power”.But his promise to scrap the House of Lords within the first four years of a new parliament - a controversial move that caused a split among his party’s grandees, has been abandoned.Starmer still backs plans for a second chamber “electoral legitimacy”, but as his party nears government he has stepped away from the most radical form of that pledge. He is now reportedly committed to cutting the number of hereditary peers, reducing the size of the chamber and introducing a new appointments process."
Yahoo News UK,"Three important UK election issues, explainedRishi Sunak said his leadership is needed in 'uncertain' times. Keir Starmer said the country needs to be 'rebuilt'. So what issues do voters care about most?","['The economy', 'Health', 'Immigration and asylum']",James Cheng-Morris,Updated 28 May 2024 at 11:11 am·5-min read,28,May,2024,11:11:00,5,"After months of speculation, Rishi Sunak confirmed the general election will be held on 4 July.The prime minister said Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer could not be trusted to lead the country through “uncertain” times. He made the economy and combating global security the key elements of his pitch to the nation as he announced the election date.In response, Starmer told voters: “Together we can stop the chaos, we can turn the page, we can start to rebuild Britain.”But amid this “uncertainty” and need to “rebuild”, what do the voters consider the key issues?This chart, produced using YouGov polling over the course of this parliament, offers an insight in the issues voters care most about and how that has ebbed and flowed over time.Compared to when Boris Johnson's Tories won the December 2019 poll, the economy, immigration, defence and tax have grown in importance in the eyes of the electorate. This has come amid the cost of living crisis; small boats crossing the English Channel; the onset of the Ukraine war and wider global instability; and the highest tax burden in 70 years.Housing has also become a bigger concern, with the Renters Reform Bill - in which the government pledged to scrap no-fault evictions - having been paused after Sunak called the election.Meanwhile, the last general election was fought - and won by the Tories - on a single issue: Brexit. Yet the chart shows a clear downturn in its relevance among voters, particularly after a trade deal was agreed with the EU in December 2020.This next chart, meanwhile, highlights what voters have considered the top issues over the past year. By a wide margin, the top three are the economy, health and immigration and asylum.Here, Yahoo News UK breaks down what is behind these issues and how they have ebbed and flowed in importance among voters since the last election in 2019.The economyThe unprecedented lockdown called by Boris Johnson in March 2020 meant the public’s attention shifted to the economy, as demonstrated by the huge spike in the chart above. The then-chancellor Rishi Sunak was forced to implement a £70bn furlough scheme, lasting 18 months, to protect people’s jobs.There was a second almighty economic shock - and rise in public concern - in February 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This caused a further spike in an already turbulent wholesale energy market, driving up costs for suppliers and ultimately customers.Average energy bills eventually reached £2,500 a year (and would have exceeded £4,000 had the government not intervened). This was double the £1,278 consumers were paying before the war and by the time this election takes place, people will still be paying much more than this: £1,568.Energy prices were also a key driver in inflation reaching 11.1% - a 41-year high - by October 2022, though it has since fallen to 2.3%, which is near the Bank of England’s 2.0% target.The third economic shock of this parliament - and most damaging for the Tories - was in October 2022 when Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng's disastrous “mini budget”, containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, prompted an economic crisis. It led to soaring interest rates, and to this day homeowners who are remortgaging are facing significantly higher bills.HealthHealth, like the economy, is another issue which clearly correlated with the beginning of the pandemic. The above chart shows an enormous spike in public concern when COVID cases started to multiply in March 2020, ultimately leading to the nationwide lockdown as the NHS faced collapse.Cases fell that summer, but spikes in the chart can be seen once infections rose again and fresh nationwide lockdowns were imposed in October 2020 and January 2021. By March 2022, likely as concerns over the Omicron variant faded, there was much less concern about health.In January last year, there was a brief spike as the NHS in England experienced the biggest industrial action in its history, with tens of thousands of nurses and ambulance staff walking out simultaneously.As for the state of play going into the election, NHS waiting lists remain higher than they were when Sunak vowed to cut them last year. According to the latest figures, an estimated 7.54 million treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of March, relating to 6.29 million patients.Immigration and asylumSince the last election, the immigration and asylum narrative has largely revolved around one issue: small boats crossing the English Channel.The numbers have risen in most of the intervening years: there were 1,843 crossings in 2019, 8,466 in 2020, 28,526 in 2021, 45,774 in 2022 and 29,437 last year. This year, the number has already passed the 10,000 mark.The regular sharp spikes in the above chart demonstrate how frequently crossings have been in the news, including some occasions when hundreds of migrants have made the dangerous journey in a single day.But it also reflects how the government has made this part of its own agenda. It was Boris Johnson’s government which first announced plans to deport migrants to Rwanda in April 2022. That policy was picked up by Rishi Sunak when he became prime minister in October that year, with Sunak since repeating his pledge to “stop the boats”.But after calling the election, Sunak admitted this week that flights would not take off before the country goes to the polls.Read moreFive important laws that could be dropped due to Sunak's snap election (Yahoo News UK)OPINION - Rishi Sunak has been in last-ditch campaign mode for so long — a General Election is logical (Evening Standard)Door open for Boris Johnson to campaign for Tories, Rishi Sunak signals (PA Media)"

Yahoo News UK,Who is Ed Davey? Lib Dem leader attracts attention with election stuntsEverything you need to know about the former minister who has pledged to fight for the NHS.,[],Hannah Fearn,7 June 2024 at 11:47 am·7-min read,7,June,2024,11:47:00,7,"Ed Davey has been involved in a number of comedy stunts since the election was called. (Alamy) With the spotlight on prime minister Rishi Sunak and Labour leader Keir Starmer as they prepare to slug it out in a general election campaign, the focus had started slipping from Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey until a series of stunts put him back in the spotlight.The former coalition government cabinet minister - who lost his seat, punished by voters for getting into bed with the Tories, but then won it back again - is sending a clear message that he should not be overlooked.He’s had a long political career and the climax may still be ahead: if polls continue to shift away from the Conservatives at the current trajectory, there’s a slim possibility that, if the election is held in October, he could end up as Leader of the Opposition.So what do we know about the man behind the third party in British politics? Hannah Fearn finds out.His early lifeEd Davey was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on Christmas Day in 1965. He was the youngest of three boys, but lost his father at just four years old, and his mother followed over a decade later when he was in his mid-teens. She spent three years battling cancer, during which time he nursed his mother together with his grandmother and brother Henry.Once a keen Scout and Air Scout, he later remembers feeling “isolated” at school because of his caring responsibilities, which meant he couldn’t take part in after-school activities or sports. “The last 18 months she was bedridden and in a lot of pain. I’d spend hours on the bed, talking to her,” he said. Davey was with his mother when she died at Nottingham General Hospital, after being placed on an unsuited dementia ward.After both his parents had died, Davey was brought up by his maternal grandparents in the village of Eakring, though his grandfather died soon after. He spent much of his childhood and young adulthood close to his grandmother. “First of all, she was looking after me. Then we were looking after each other,” he said.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

Gasson stood in four elections but failed to win a seat and is now a councillor. The pair have two children, a son and daughter.Their son, born in 2007 and now a teenager, is disabled with a neurological condition. He attended special schools but is now educated at home with a tutor - a change that Davey said led to him becoming verbal for the first time. He has spoken about his anxiety about who will care for his son when he and his wife are no longer around. “It’s the thing that worries me more than anything else in my life,” he said.Gasson was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in 2012. She was well for many years following her diagnosis, but declined during lockdown and is working on recovering her physical strength.Liberal Democrats election broadcast shows Ed Davey with his son. (Liberal Democrats)His parentsHis father, John, was a solicitor and his mother, Nina, a teacher. Davey has described how he was inspired to study by his mother, who always wanted him to try hard academically and who he wanted to impress.His educationDavey attended the private Nottingham High School, the alma mater of former chancellor Kenneth Clarke. He became head boy, with Labour MP Ed Balls - who was studying in the year below - watching on. After school, he achieved a first class degree in philosophy, politics and economics at Jesus College, Oxford where he was junior common room president. After becoming an economics research for the Liberal Democrats he returned to study, reading for a master’s degree in economics at Birkbeck College, London.Ed Davey, pictured with his family. (Liberal Democrats)Why is he a sir?For three years, the Lib Dem leader was a member of the cabinet during the period of Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, holding the post of secretary of state for energy and climate change from 2012 to 2015. He was knighted in the 2016 New Year’s Honours for “political and public services”.Davey on... the cost of living crisisDavey has repeatedly attacked the government for failing to curb rapid inflation and the devastating effect it is having on household budgets. He called the Conservative Party “so out of touch they might as well be living on another planet”, and said he warned Jeremy Hunt “people are desperate for real help… but all the chancellor could offer is empty words and unfair tax hikes”. In particular, he has urged more action on food price inflation, which analysis from his own party found had risen 37 per cent in one year for the average weekly supermarket trip. He has promised to end energy hikes and abandoned his plan to add 1p to income tax to save the NHS because ordinary voters can no longer afford it.Davey on... the NHSThe Liberal Democrats have made the NHS a cornerstone of their policy platform for the last five years. In Davey’s words: “Voting Conservative is bad for your health.” He promises to reverse cuts to GP numbers and guarantee a doctor’s appointment when you need one, improve access to NHS dentistry and save lives by tackling ambulance call out delays. Davey blames the care crisis for deepening the problems of the health service and says his party would spend £5bn a year on a “care package” to ensure patients are discharged from hospital more quickly, freeing up bed space. However, there is little detail on how this would be financed without raising taxes on the wealthiest - which Davey has promised not to do in his push to poach disillusioned Tory voters.British Leader of the Liberal Democrats party Ed Davey arrives at the BBC Broadcasting House, for his appearance on 'Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg', in London, Britain, April 28, 2024. REUTERS/Maja SmiejkowskaDavey on... immigrationThe Lib Dem leader has been a long-standing advocate for refugee rights and critic of the government’s immigration policy. He has called for Conservative plans to deport failed asylum seekers to Rwanda a “cynical distraction” from the partygate crisis and the money would be better spent on measures to tackle the cost of living crisis. He added: “They’ve provided no evidence to suggest that this new policy will stop illegal smuggling, they’re not cracking down on the organised crime gangs, which is what you need to do.” He has called for a new right to work for refugees and asylum seekers, and major reform of the Home Office which he says is no longer up to the job. After the end of the coalition government, Davey has said his party “was wrong” to go along with the introduction of a minimum income standard for immigrants. He later described the policy as “nasty and unfair”.Davey on... the Post Office scandalDespite the Horizon scandal that led to the wrongful prosecution of more than 700 subpostmasters crossing the tenure of more than a dozen business secretaries, Ed Davey has recently taken the heat for failing to investigate the issue while he was in the job.It has emerged that Davey initially rejected a request to meet justice campaigner Alan Bates, and later accepted it only on the advice that it would be good for his PR. He has recently apologised for not acting earlier, admitting that he is sorry that he “did not see through Post Office lies” about the fault in the Horizon programme."

Yahoo News UK,"Who is Richard Tice? Reform’s former leader turned Farage sidekickThe candidate for Hartlepool has seen his party's popularity swell in recent months, with one poll showing reform ahead of the Conservatives.",[],Andrew Naughtie,Updated 14 June 2024 at 6:45 am·6-min read,14,June,2024,06:45:00,6,"Now that Nigel Farage has taken over as the leader of Reform UK, Richard Tice’s public profile is fading fast - but the Reform chairman remains involved in the party's operations.So far, the party has only one MP, Conservative defector Lee Anderson. But a recent poll has shown Reform overtaking the Tories, raising the possibility Anderson could hold his seat and even end up with fellow Reformers in the next Parliament.As the candidate for Hartlepool, where he stood as the Brexit Party candidate in 2019, Tice hopes to be one of them. So who is he, and what does he stand for?Childhood and educationBorn in Surrey in 1964 to James Tice, a showjumper, and Joan Tice, a horse trainer. Educated at the private boarding school Uppingham, he studied at the University of Salford, gaining a degree in construction economics and quantity surveying – teeing him up for a career that he said would ""continue the family genes in the property industry"".Family (partner & kids)Tice has three children from a 24-year marriage that ended in divorce. He is now in a long-term relationship with the right-wing writer and journalist Isabel Oakeshott.She is perhaps best known for two notorious incidents that set her against leading Tories: a book that featured the heavily disputed allegation that David Cameron had engaged in sexual activity with a pig, and the release of embarrassing messages entrusted to her by Matt Hancock when she agreed to write a book with him.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election? Full list mappedThe key issues that will decide the electionWhen is the first UK general election TV debate?What is purdah? The strict rule that governs what politicians can and can't sayNet worthWhile not quite in the same league as Rishi Sunak, Tice is one of the wealthiest people in British politics. As he describes it on his website, he made his multi-million-pound fortune over the course of “30 years of making things happen in property investment”, starting with a graduate job at a London firm in 1987.According to Tice, the company he leads as CEO, Quidnet Capital, has “bought and managed £500 million in commercial properties across the UK on behalf of clients”.He was also a key figure in the redevelopment of London’s Nine Elms district, near Battersea Power Station, a controversial project that has transformed a stretch of the Thames’s south bank with a welter of rapidly erected high-rise blocks.GB News linksAlong with Nigel Farage, Lee Anderson and several MPs on the right flank of the Tory party, Tice is a regular on the hard-right, culture war-focused TV outlet GB News. There he hosts a programme called “Richard Tice’s Sunday Sermon”, which serves as a platform for him to deliver his political analysis without the interruptions of an interviewer.However, despite the network being a relatively safe space for him in ideological terms, Tice’s appearances aren’t always amicable. A recent interview with host Andrew Pierce, a longtime right-wing commentator, saw him challenged fiercely about Reform’s chances in a summer election should one be called – with Pierce pointing to the “weirdos” selected by the party to fight numerous seats as evidence the party is “not ready”.Richard Tice, pictured in 2018 at a 'Leave Means Leave' campaign event, is focused on the issue of immigration. (Steve Finn/WENN)Tice was also involved in an incident that saw the network deemed in breach of broadcasting regulator Ofcom’s impartiality regulations, specifically an interview in which a former Brexit Party MEP failed to “sufficiently challenge” his views on immigration.The regulator is under increasing pressure to crack down on GB News heading into the election, with critics arguing it cannot be allowed to broadcast shows that feature Tory and Reform MPs interviewing each other without alternative points of view represented.Tice on NHSThe state and future of the NHS set to be one of this election’s main battlegrounds, and Reform’s key health policy is to spend £17 billion on the NHS on top of its current budget in an effort to get waiting lists down to zero. It also proposes introducing tax relief on private healthcare – something that has been criticised by opponents as a creeping step towards the privatisation of healthcare writ large.Tice’s stated rationale is that the reason the service is struggling is because the money it needs is being spent on other things that the public do not in fact support. Top of the list is Net Zero, which the party and its predecessors have long decried as a pointless “woke” project.In April, Tice used a press conference to frame the choice starkly. “We have a choice in this country, it seems to me,” he said. “A pretty clear choice. Do we want zero waiting lists in two years, and to keep them there? That is the Reform choice. Or do we want net zero CO2 emissions in 25 years? That is the Labour choice.”Tice on immigrationImmigration is by far Reform UK’s top issue, with the party looking to build on Farage’s two decades of campaigning against it in its legal and illegal forms.As far as the election goes, Tice and the party are targeting the continuing arrival of small boats of people travelling across the English Channel, many of them seeking asylum. He has criticised the government for failing to stop “mass immigration” post-Brexit, and described Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda policy as “a disaster”, arguing on GB News that its supposed deterrent value was revealed to be zero just hours after the House of Commons finally passed the law.Reform chairman Richard Tice (L) and leader Nigel Farage speak at the party's economic policy launch at Church House in London. (Alamy Live News)“Within a matter of hours more boats, absolutely packed full, overfilled with illegal migrants, were setting off from the beaches. And we learnt on Tuesday morning that sadly five people, including a young child, drowned leaving the beaches. That's not a deterrent. That's an absolute disaster.”Instead of deporting people to Rwanda, he is arguing for a “pick up and take back” policy that would see small boat arrivals deposited back on French soil. As evidence that this is both practical and humane, he has cited similar policies deployed in the US and Australia.However, he has not addressed the fact that Australia’s policy has been criticised internationally for leaving so-called “boat people” confined to facilities on the island of Nauru, where there have been incidents of suicide and self-immolation.Tice on cost of living crisisPerhaps unsurprisingly given he is trying to peel away former Tory voters, Tice has criticised recent Tory prime ministers harshly for overseeing Britain’s intense cost of living crisis. In 2022, he accused then-prime minister Boris Johnson of “waffling” over the situation. “Clueless, out of touch, no ideas, no help,” he tweeted. “Shocking.”He has also warned that the prospect of a “disastrous” Labour government will offer no prospect of meaningful relief for struggling households.Instead, Reform proposes lifting the minimum level of income tax to £20,000 while cutting various other taxes – among them fuel duty, another gesture to the party’s rejection of environmentalism as a top priority."
The Independent,Rishi Sunak accused of failing to order probe into 17 potential breaches of ministerial code,[],Kate Devlin,26 June 2024 at 8:21 am·3-min read,26,June,2024,08:21:00,3,"Rishi Sunak has been accused of eroding the public’s trust in politics by failing to order investigations into more than a dozen potential breaches of strict ethics rules during his time as prime minister.The Liberal Democrats say he presided over 17 possible violations of the ministerial code in 18 months, none of which were referred to his ethics adviser.The accusation comes as the Conservative’s election campaign is embroiled in a betting scandal.The Westminster gambling row deepened late on Tuesday when a cabinet minister revealed he had placed bets on the date of the general election.Scotland secretary Alister Jack denied he had broken any rules, but said he put three wagers on the timing of the July 4 poll, becoming the latest of seven politicians and officials to be drawn in to the controversy.Earlier Sir Keir Starmer took aim at Rishi Sunak’s leadership ability over the betting scandal, accusing the prime minister of “failing to grasp the nettle” and take action quickly enough.Rishi Sunak at a Conservative general election campaign event in EdinburghDaisy Cooper, the deputy leader of the Lib Dems, who compiled the list, accused the Tory government of being “besieged by sleaze”.“Their brazen disregard for the rules has torn up standards in public life and eroded trust in our political system,” she said.And she said Mr Sunak had “proven himself too weak to take any action on the slew of Conservative scandals under his leadership”.The Lib Dems say they would stamp out sleaze by enshrining the ministerial code in law and make the government’s ethics adviser fully independent, a move they say would stop ministers “marking their own homework”.Cases cited by the Lib Dems include Rishi Sunak’s wife’s shares in a childcare company which could have benefited from a government scheme.The party also pointed to cabinet minister Michelle Donelan’s use of £34,000 of taxpayers’ money to cover libel damages.And that no action was taken over allegations against  Mark Menzies, who disputes claims he used thousands of pounds of party funds to pay off people who had locked him in a flat, before the story hit the headlines.Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has admitted he made bets - but denied wrongdoing (PA Wire)The Libs Dems say cases which warranted an investigation occurred almost once a month since the appointment of Mr Sunak’s Ethics Adviser in December 2022.One of his predecessors, Boris Johnson, lost an ethics adviser in 2020 when Sir Alex Allan quit after he was overruled over a report into alleged bullying by the home secretary Priti Patel.The Lib Dems say other potential breaches of the ministerial code included Nadhim Zahawi’s legal threats to campaigners and journalists, including this newspaper, over his tax affairs.Ms Cooper said that the Conservatives had been “besieged by sleaze” and that her party’s plans would “end the cycle of scandals”.The Conservatives have been approached for comment."
