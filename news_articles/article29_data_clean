Husain explained the noise to the audience by confirming a demonstration was taking place.The distraction did not stop the Conservative and Labour leaders from attacking each other on immigration, tax and welfare.A snap poll released by YouGov in the minutes after the debate concluded there was no clear winner, with both receiving 47% of the vote in a survey of 1,716 viewers, with 6% saying they did not know who was the victor.When asked what they thought of the BBC debate, 62% said they found it “frustrating” and 40% said it was “interesting”.Earlier, a poll by Electoral Calculus of 19,000 people forecast that Labour would win 650 seats in the House of Commons to the Conservatives’ 60, with the Liberal Democrats in second place on 71 and Reform UK on 18 seats.The debate ended in acrimonious fashion, with Starmer accusing Sunak of lying after the prime minister once again brought up the Conservatives’ claim, widely discredited, that a Labour government would mean people would pay £2,000 more in tax.Addressing the country, Sunak said: “Can you afford to pay at least £2,000 more in tax? If you’re not certain about Labour, don’t surrender to them, don’t vote for any other party, vote Conservative.”In response, Starmer said: “That is a lie, he’s been told not to repeat that lie and he’s just done it.”Husain raised the criticism directed at the spending plans of both men’s parties raised by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, saying the think tank accused them of “ignoring raw facts”.Perhaps the biggest cheer of the night was reserved for an audience member, Robert Blackstock, who criticised both men.He said Sunak had made a “fair job of being chancellor”, but is a “pretty mediocre prime minister”. He then said he believes Starmer’s “strings” are being pulled by senior members of the Labour Party.Blackstock asked: “Are you two really the best we’ve got to be prime minister of our great country?”Asked later about women's rights, both committed to protecting women’s rights to single-sex spaces, regardless of whether someone has a gender recognition certificate. Sunak said he seek to ""change the law, so that the old Equalities Act recognises that sex means biological sex"", while Starmer referenced an anti-trans joke made by Sunak in front of the mother of a murdered trans teenager.Sunak and Starmer also sparred on immigration, with Sunak claiming a new Labour trade deal with the EU would mean the free movement of people into the UK, accusing Starmer of “taking people for fools”.Starmer insisted: “We are not going back into the EU. We are not accepting freedom of movement. I’m not a defeatist like the prime minister.”The exchange came on the day Home Office figures revealed that more than 50,000 migrants have arrived in the UK after crossing the English Channel since Sunak became prime minister, including more than 13,000 this year.Starmer has been criticised for his comments on immigration during a debate hosted by The Sun newspaper earlier this week, in which he singled out Bangladesh, saying that “at the moment people coming from countries like Bangladesh are not being removed”.Sabina Akhtar, a Labour councillor in Stepney Green in London, resigned from the party on Wednesday in protest at his comments.Early in the debate, Starmer brought up Sunak’s fine for breaking COVID lockdown rules, and later he said the prime minister’s “lived world is millions of miles away” from millions of families in the UK. He also said Sunak was “out of touch”.Read a full account of the key moments of the debate, plus reactions:LIVE COVERAGE IS OVER41 updatesWed 26 June 2024 at 6:00 pm GMT-4Harriet SinclairHow well do BBC debate viewers think the leaders performed?This is how well (and badly) viewers thought the leaders performed in tonight's debate.How well or badly do BBC debate viewers think each leader performed?Rishi SunakWell: 56%Badly: 44%Keir StarmerWell: 61%Badly: 39%https://t.co/wjNCCLiyWP pic.twitter.com/3dECqu1N8c— YouGov (@YouGov) June 26, 2024Wed 26 June 2024 at 5:45 pm GMT-4Harriet Sinclair Starmer and Sunak clash over small boats and betting in final TV debate before polling dayRishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer clashed over migration and the betting scandal that has engulfed Westminster in their final televised head-to-head before polling day.The Prime Minster asked the Labour leader if he was planning to make a deal with the Taliban to send back asylum seekers rejected from the UK in a spiky exchange over the small boats crisis.Read the full story from the Evening Standard.Wed 26 June 2024 at 5:30 pm GMT-4Harriet Sinclair Combative, energetic, passionate – where has this Rishi been until now?If the Tories don’t knock a chunk out of Labour’s lead after Rishi Sunak’s terrier-like performance in the BBC debate, it won’t be for lack of trying.Unlike England’s footballers, Mr Sunak gave it everything he had to expose the Labour leader’s weaknesses on tax, migration and women’s rights.He also had a new word for voting Labour: surrender.Read the full story from The Telegraph.Wed 26 June 2024 at 5:08 pm GMT-4Harriet Sinclair Key moments from BBC’s head-to-head election debate between Starmer and SunakRishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer have faced off in the final televised head-to-head clash of the General Election campaign.The BBC debate, hosted by Mishal Husain, saw the Tory and Labour leaders grilled about their positions on a variety of issues, including migration, welfare and the gambling scandal which has emerged in the middle of the election campaign.Read the full story from PA.Wed 26 June 2024 at 4:53 pm GMT-4Harriet SinclairConservative voters overwhelmingly find Sunak the winnerThe large majority of Tory voters thought Sunak won the debate.Conservative 2019 voters who viewed the #BBCdebate think Sunak won by 82% to 18%https://t.co/wjNCCLiyWP pic.twitter.com/xe8eWvhX3E— YouGov (@YouGov) June 26, 2024Wed 26 June 2024 at 4:50 pm GMT-4Harriet Sinclair Who won the BBC general election TV debate?

We will have a low mortgage deposit scheme to help young people get on the ladder.""Sunak replied: ""It’s become too hard to own your own home.

Here’s another more blatant question. Everyone try again.” #BBCDebate— Dyl (@dylanhjm) June 26, 2024Of course the BBC, not content with answers on representing women that didn’t drag trans people into the debate, had to do a follow up to ensure it was a political football #BBCdebate— Pete of the North (@PeteOfTheNorth) June 26, 2024I don’t really know why they allowed the trans rights question through. Such a complex and nuanced issue should not be discussed so flippantly in a debate format like this. #BBCDebate— CMK  (@Conor_MK) June 26, 2024Wed 26 June 2024 at 4:19 pm GMT-4Harriet SinclairBusiness owner says she has lost 90% of business with EuropeJulie, who owns a jazz vinyl record business, said that after Brexit she had lost 90% of our business with Europe. She asked: how can we mend our broken trading relationship with Europe? (BBC)Small business owner Julie said she had lost 90% of her European business post-Brexit and asked how the leaders would repair relations with Europe.Sunak thanked her for running a small business and said he would cut taxes on business rates, and he wanted to abolish national insurance for small businesses. ""I am the person who has made sure we have good relations with Europe,"" he said.Starmer responded that money for national insurance was used for the NHS and pensions, asking how the Conservative party would pay for it.He said that he voted to remain in the EU, but that we are not going back to the EU. He added that he did not accept that the UK could not get a better deal than we have, adding that Boris Johnson ""botched it"".He said: ""We are not going back into the EU. We are not accepting freedom of movement. I'm not a defeatist like the prime minister. I'm going to fight for a better deal so you can succeed and our economy can succeed.Sunak replied:""What it will cost is more migration. You’re taking people for fools.""Starmer shot back: ""One of the problems with this prime minister is his lived world is millions of miles away from the millions of families they’re trying to support.""Wed 26 June 2024 at 4:13 pm GMT-4Harriet SinclairLeaders asked about single-sex spacesThe leaders were asked if they would protect single-sex spaces.Sunak said he would protect female-only spaces and female-only services. He said Starmer had not matched his pledge to reform the equalities law to reflect that ""sex"" means ""biological sex"".Starmer said: ""yes, is the answer to the question. it is very important that we protect women's spaces,"" adding that he had worked with groups involved in tackling sexual violence.He added: ""I do recognise that there are a small number of people who are born into a gender they don't recognise and I will treat them as I treat all human beings - with dignity and respect... otherwise you end up where we did with the prime minister of a country making a joke about trans people in front of the mother of a murdered transgender teenager.""Sunak responded that he did not make a joke (as the mother of Brianna Ghey sat in Parliament), and said Starmer was not pledging to protect female-only spaces.Starmer said: ""Over the past 14 years, there’s been this tendency on almost every issue to find the points of difference and division rather than bringing the country together which is what we’re good at.""Sunak said: ""When it comes to women's safety, sex means biological sex for me - that is the only way you can deliver the protections that Vicky (who asked the question) wants."" He also harked back to the hounding of Labour MP Rosie Duffield over the issue.Starmer's response was criticised by supporters of Duffield, including gender critical author JK Rowling.It's very important that we protect women's spaces... but men can also be women, says the Labour leader.

""I think that leadership is about empowering your team,"" he said.Rishi Sunak said: ""I have two young daughters and that's how you can trust me, because as a dad I want them to grow up in a country that is safe for them"".He said the government had been making changes to HRT and maternity care, and was rolling out more free childcare ""and that will make a big difference to families up and down the country"".Talking about gender recognition certificates, Sunak said he would change the law so that sex means biological sex. ""That’s how you protect female only spaces and services,"" he said.Starmer said it is ""very important that we protect women-only spaces"", adding: ""I do recognise that there are a small number of people who are born into a gender they don't identify with and I will treat them with respect.""Wed 26 June 2024 at 4:03 pm GMT-4Harriet SinclairLeaders both asked about their capability to be PM🚨 NEW: Voter Robert to Rishi Sunak: “You’re a pretty mediocre prime minister” To Keir Starmer: “Your strings are being pulled by very senior members of the Labour Party.” “Are you two really the best we’ve got to be prime minister of our great country?”#BBCDebate pic.twitter.com/RISQuSI5Sk— Politics UK (@PolitlcsUK) June 26, 2024An audience member asked, to huge applause, ""Are you two really the best we've got to be prime minister of our great country?""Sunak responded he understood the frustration and said the country had faced some tough times.

(BBC)Keir Starmer said he was ""very concerned"" about Nottingham council running out of money, adding that there were also Conservative-run councils that had run out of money. ""We would change the way payments were made to councils,"" he said, adding that longer term, three-year financial settlements would help, as well as specific proposals around no-fault evictions. ""Huge damage has been done to our economy,"" he added.Rishi Sunak responded: ""Most politics is local. The services you mentioned are so important. I want to roll out family hubs. Nottingham is a glimpse of the future, bankrupt under Labour. Birmingham, that is a snapshot of what will happen if Keir Starmer is in power.""Mishal Husain interjected that other councils such as Woking and Thurrock that have also been in finfncial troubles were Conservative.Wed 26 June 2024 at 3:53 pm GMT-4Harriet SinclairViewers say Starmer struggling with formatPosts on social media suggest viewers don't think Starmer is doing well with the format.This debate format isn't currently working for Keir Starmer.

If you’re a young couple, we’ve effectively abolished stamp duty. Those are the tax cuts, that’s how we’re going to pay for it. Mark my words your taxes are going to go up under a Labour government.""Keir Starmer responded: ""False. Liz Truss tried that experiment on the country. Rishi Sunak said we should unite behind her. I am not prepared to inflict that on the country. Rishi Sunak hasn’t learned the lesson, he has commitments in there that is unfunded.""When Starmer dismissed Sunak's defence that he warned people about Liz Truss, moderator Mishal Husain interjected to say in reference to Jeremy Corbyn: ""Hang on, you know what it’s like to unite behind the leader of your party"", prompting applause from the audience.Wed 26 June 2024 at 3:48 pm GMT-4Harriet SinclairWhat's happening outside the debateThe noise has died down somewhat, but protesters remain outside the debate.General Election Debate Protest in Nottingham started.We will not allow Genocide enablers to go undisturbed in our city.Free Palestine! 🇵🇸✊ pic.twitter.com/rA8uBiaOot— Nottingham Solidarity Group (@NottsSolidarity) June 26, 2024Wed 26 June 2024 at 3:47 pm GMT-4Harriet SinclairSunak claims migrants 'queueing up in Calais' for a Labour governmentRishi Sunak claimed that people were queueing up in Calais to wait for Keir Starmer to be in charge.He said: ""Do not surrender our borders to Keir Starmer and the Labour party.

Are you going to sit down with the Ayatollah, do a deal with the Taliban? It is complete nonsense... You are taking people for fools, I think these people should not stay in our country. They will be put on planes to Rwanda.""For context, more than 50,000 migrants have arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel since Sunak became prime minister, including over 13,000 so far this year.Home Office figures show 144 people made the journey in three boats on Tuesday, taking the provisional total for 2024 to date to 13,045.This is already a record for the first six months of a calendar year.Wed 26 June 2024 at 3:41 pm GMT-4Harriet SinclairLeaders asked why we can't 'easily' close our bordersKeir Starmer.

He said he had been part of operations to take down terrorist gangs.Sunak said it was ""completely unfair"" that people came here illegally and jumped the queue. ""We have made progress, the numbers have come down over the past 12 months compared to the 12 months before"" and said the Rwanda plan would solve the issue.Sunak was reminded that the numbers of arrivals for this year were up.Sunak replied that if Labour won, the people smugglers ""would need a bigger boat"".Wed 26 June 2024 at 3:34 pm GMT-4Harriet SinclairStarmer claps back at Sunak over welfareBeverly asked about welfare.

I think that in the last 14 years politics has become too much about self entitlement, and MPs thinking about what they could get for themselves.”He added: “The instinct of these people to think the first thing they should do is try to make money, that was the wrong instinct, and we have to change that.”Starmer continued: “What I did, when one of my team was alleged to have been involved and investigated by the Gambling Commission, they were suspended within minutes, because I knew it made it really important to be swift, the Prime Minister delayed and delayed and delayed until eventually he was bullied into taking off.”In response, Sunak said: “It was important to me, that given the seriousness and the sensitivity of the matters at hand that they were dealt with properly, and that’s what I’ve done.”Wed 26 June 2024 at 3:16 pm GMT-4Harriet SinclairThe debate beginsThe final showdown between Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer has begun.Wed 26 June 2024 at 3:15 pm GMT-4Harriet SinclairLib Dems air election broadcast ahead of the debateEd Davey spoke movingly about his mother.

We’re going to work until 10pm on July 4 to earn people’s vote.“It’s clear quite a lot of people have made up their mind to vote Liberal Democrat and that’s very, very exciting – people who were thinking of voting Labour and realise they can’t win in seats like here in Henley, and vast parts of the Home Counties and the West Country, and they’re backing us, and I’m grateful for that.“But we want to persuade people who are a bit undecided, possibly people who have voted Conservative before, to come and join us to get the Conservatives out of government – I think they need to go out of government.”The Liberal Democrat leader added: “Whoever’s in government, they need strong opposition, they need people who can hold people to account on things like the health service, so that’s why I think over the next few days we’re going to be talking to everybody, particularly those undecided Conservatives, to see if they’ll come and join us.“Some of them will have to break a habit of a lifetime, and that can be really difficult for people, but I hope when they listen to us on the economy, on the health service, on the police, on the environment, they’ll know we’re the right home for them.”Wed 26 June 2024 at 1:45 pm GMT-4Harriet SinclairHow is the Tory betting scandal playing to undecided voters?The betting scandal is threatening to engulf Sunak's final days of campaigning.On the #Daily, @SkyNewsNiall is joined by @darrenmccaffrey and @LukeTryl to look at how the election date betting scandal is cutting through to those who are still wondering who to support - and those who could change their mind. 🎧➡️ https://t.co/ERzU4zUofj— Sky News (@SkyNews) June 26, 2024Wed 26 June 2024 at 1:30 pm GMT-4Harriet SinclairGreenpeace defends Tory bus protestGreenpeace protester Amy Rugg-Easey, holds a banner after climbing on to the roof of the Conservative election campaign bus.

Yahoo News UK,"Who is Richard Tice? Reform’s former leader turned Farage sidekickThe candidate for Hartlepool has seen his party's popularity swell in recent months, with one poll showing reform ahead of the Conservatives.",[],Andrew Naughtie,Updated 14 June 2024 at 6:45 am·6-min read,14,June,2024,06:45:00,6,"Now that Nigel Farage has taken over as the leader of Reform UK, Richard Tice’s public profile is fading fast - but the Reform chairman remains involved in the party's operations.So far, the party has only one MP, Conservative defector Lee Anderson. But a recent poll has shown Reform overtaking the Tories, raising the possibility Anderson could hold his seat and even end up with fellow Reformers in the next Parliament.As the candidate for Hartlepool, where he stood as the Brexit Party candidate in 2019, Tice hopes to be one of them. So who is he, and what does he stand for?Childhood and educationBorn in Surrey in 1964 to James Tice, a showjumper, and Joan Tice, a horse trainer. Educated at the private boarding school Uppingham, he studied at the University of Salford, gaining a degree in construction economics and quantity surveying – teeing him up for a career that he said would ""continue the family genes in the property industry"".Family (partner & kids)Tice has three children from a 24-year marriage that ended in divorce. He is now in a long-term relationship with the right-wing writer and journalist Isabel Oakeshott.She is perhaps best known for two notorious incidents that set her against leading Tories: a book that featured the heavily disputed allegation that David Cameron had engaged in sexual activity with a pig, and the release of embarrassing messages entrusted to her by Matt Hancock when she agreed to write a book with him.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election? Full list mappedThe key issues that will decide the electionWhen is the first UK general election TV debate?What is purdah? The strict rule that governs what politicians can and can't sayNet worthWhile not quite in the same league as Rishi Sunak, Tice is one of the wealthiest people in British politics. As he describes it on his website, he made his multi-million-pound fortune over the course of “30 years of making things happen in property investment”, starting with a graduate job at a London firm in 1987.According to Tice, the company he leads as CEO, Quidnet Capital, has “bought and managed £500 million in commercial properties across the UK on behalf of clients”.He was also a key figure in the redevelopment of London’s Nine Elms district, near Battersea Power Station, a controversial project that has transformed a stretch of the Thames’s south bank with a welter of rapidly erected high-rise blocks.GB News linksAlong with Nigel Farage, Lee Anderson and several MPs on the right flank of the Tory party, Tice is a regular on the hard-right, culture war-focused TV outlet GB News. There he hosts a programme called “Richard Tice’s Sunday Sermon”, which serves as a platform for him to deliver his political analysis without the interruptions of an interviewer.However, despite the network being a relatively safe space for him in ideological terms, Tice’s appearances aren’t always amicable. A recent interview with host Andrew Pierce, a longtime right-wing commentator, saw him challenged fiercely about Reform’s chances in a summer election should one be called – with Pierce pointing to the “weirdos” selected by the party to fight numerous seats as evidence the party is “not ready”.Richard Tice, pictured in 2018 at a 'Leave Means Leave' campaign event, is focused on the issue of immigration. (Steve Finn/WENN)Tice was also involved in an incident that saw the network deemed in breach of broadcasting regulator Ofcom’s impartiality regulations, specifically an interview in which a former Brexit Party MEP failed to “sufficiently challenge” his views on immigration.The regulator is under increasing pressure to crack down on GB News heading into the election, with critics arguing it cannot be allowed to broadcast shows that feature Tory and Reform MPs interviewing each other without alternative points of view represented.Tice on NHSThe state and future of the NHS set to be one of this election’s main battlegrounds, and Reform’s key health policy is to spend £17 billion on the NHS on top of its current budget in an effort to get waiting lists down to zero. It also proposes introducing tax relief on private healthcare – something that has been criticised by opponents as a creeping step towards the privatisation of healthcare writ large.Tice’s stated rationale is that the reason the service is struggling is because the money it needs is being spent on other things that the public do not in fact support. Top of the list is Net Zero, which the party and its predecessors have long decried as a pointless “woke” project.In April, Tice used a press conference to frame the choice starkly. “We have a choice in this country, it seems to me,” he said. “A pretty clear choice. Do we want zero waiting lists in two years, and to keep them there? That is the Reform choice. Or do we want net zero CO2 emissions in 25 years? That is the Labour choice.”Tice on immigrationImmigration is by far Reform UK’s top issue, with the party looking to build on Farage’s two decades of campaigning against it in its legal and illegal forms.As far as the election goes, Tice and the party are targeting the continuing arrival of small boats of people travelling across the English Channel, many of them seeking asylum. He has criticised the government for failing to stop “mass immigration” post-Brexit, and described Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda policy as “a disaster”, arguing on GB News that its supposed deterrent value was revealed to be zero just hours after the House of Commons finally passed the law.Reform chairman Richard Tice (L) and leader Nigel Farage speak at the party's economic policy launch at Church House in London. (Alamy Live News)“Within a matter of hours more boats, absolutely packed full, overfilled with illegal migrants, were setting off from the beaches. And we learnt on Tuesday morning that sadly five people, including a young child, drowned leaving the beaches. That's not a deterrent. That's an absolute disaster.”Instead of deporting people to Rwanda, he is arguing for a “pick up and take back” policy that would see small boat arrivals deposited back on French soil. As evidence that this is both practical and humane, he has cited similar policies deployed in the US and Australia.However, he has not addressed the fact that Australia’s policy has been criticised internationally for leaving so-called “boat people” confined to facilities on the island of Nauru, where there have been incidents of suicide and self-immolation.Tice on cost of living crisisPerhaps unsurprisingly given he is trying to peel away former Tory voters, Tice has criticised recent Tory prime ministers harshly for overseeing Britain’s intense cost of living crisis. In 2022, he accused then-prime minister Boris Johnson of “waffling” over the situation. “Clueless, out of touch, no ideas, no help,” he tweeted. “Shocking.”He has also warned that the prospect of a “disastrous” Labour government will offer no prospect of meaningful relief for struggling households.Instead, Reform proposes lifting the minimum level of income tax to £20,000 while cutting various other taxes – among them fuel duty, another gesture to the party’s rejection of environmentalism as a top priority."
Sky News,"Exit from recession was stronger than first thought, official figures show",[],Sky News,28 June 2024 at 2:54 am·3-min read,28,June,2024,02:54:00,3,"The UK's exit from recession during the first three months of the year was stronger than initial figures suggested, according to official data.In an update on its first growth estimate, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.7% between January and March.It had originally said on 10 May that output was 0.6% up on the previous three months - a positive figure that brought to an end the shallow recession that struck during the second half of 2023.Then, the effects of Bank of England interest rate rises to combat inflation were widely blamed by economists for choking off demand.Money latest:Former Bank of England rate-setter sees cut ahead this summerAll the growth during the January-March period was attributable to the services sector, which accounts for almost 80% of the economy.We have since learned there was zero growth recorded by the ONS for the month of April, with poor weather hitting construction and high streets.The data is the last from the ONS before the country goes to the polls on 4 July - with the economy, and personal finances especially, among the topics high on voters' minds following the effects of the COVID pandemic and energy-driven cost of living crisis.The timing of the general election has coincided with fierce debate over whether the Bank should now be cutting interest rates, allowing for an easing in borrowing costs.At its last policy meeting just over a week ago, the rate-setting committee voted 7-2 to maintain Bank rate at 5.25%.The minutes of the meeting betrayed continuing worries about the pace of wage growth and stubborn inflation within services.The Bank fears that a rate rise, at this stage, risks fuelling price growth further as basic salaries grow at a pace of 6%.The rate of inflation is currently back at its 2% target for the first time in three years.Despite this gap in favour of consumers, with wage growth outpacing inflation since June last year, the effects of the crises since 2020 have taken their toll, according to campaigners on living standards.The Resolution Foundation said on Friday real household disposable incomes were lower in early 2024 than they were back in late 2019.It said growth so far in this parliament was weaker than all but two parliaments since 1910, despite growth over the past year of 2.4%.The thinktank declared average incomes were £120 a year lower per person over the period since the last election.Figures such as this get to the heart of the election campaign amid criticism of the main parties' lack of clarity over their tax and spending commitments.But they also give ammunition to critics of the Bank of England who argue interest rates should come down.Read more:Manifesto checker: What are all the parties' pledges?A very simple guide to what each party is promisingIn its financial stability report on Thursday, there was a further nod to pressures ahead as it warned there were still three million mortgage holders yet to feel the pain of higher interest rates in their repayments.As things stand, financial markets and economists see August or September as the likely months for the first rate cut, barring any new shocks.For many, the prospect of action in June was largely eradicated by the election - the Bank anxious to avoid any questions over its independence."

But what annoys me is that f****** p*** we’ve got in. What good is he? You tell me, you know. He’s just wet.

The place near Dover. Army recruitment. Get the young recruits there, yeah, with guns on the f****** beach, target practice. F****** just shoot them.“That is what the Greeks done. You know about that. The Greeks shot a load. Ringfence Bradfordstan. Round the f****** up. Do that f****** lot as well. And you’ve got these b******s running our country.

Any of that f****** lot get in your ambulance, just don’t put oxygen on the b******. Use something else. You know where I’m coming from.”Long-time party activist George Jones, who organises events for Mr Farage, was also caught describing the Pride flag as “degenerate” and LGBT+ people “nonces”.Long time party activist George Jones (right) described LGBT+ people as ‘nonces’ in the undercover footage (Channel 4 News)In the covertly filmed exchange, Mr Jones reacted angrily when he saw a police car driving past a pub displaying an LGBT flag.He said: “You see that f****** degenerate flag on the front bonnet? What are the old bill doing promoting that crap? They should be out catching nonces not promoting the fuckers.”Going on to explain Reform’s criminal justice policies, he said the party would “bring back the noose” and added: “Our police officers will be paramilitaries, they won’t be police,” and that the party should “bring back the noose”.On Thursday, Reform UK candidate Raymond Saint was dropped after it emerged that he had been on a list of members of the British National party.The upstart party has been dogged by controversy, with pro-Hitler and pro-Putin comments made by a number of candidates over the last few months. Mr Farage blamed a third-party vetting company for failing to do its job properly.Reform UK has been dogged by controversy, with pro-Hitler and pro-Putin comments made by a number of candidates over the last few months (Getty Images)Ian Gribbin, who was standing in Bexhill and Battle, said Britain would have been “far better” off if it had “taken Hitler up on his offer of neutrality” instead of fighting the Nazis.Mr Farage told Channel 4 News: “I am dismayed by the reported comments of a handful of people associated with my local campaign, particularly those who are volunteers. They will no longer be with the campaign.“The appalling sentiments expressed by some in these exchanges bear no relation to my own views, those of the vast majority of our supporters or Reform UK policy. Some of the language used was reprehensible.”Mr Parker told the broadcaster: “I would like to make it clear that neither Nigel Farage personally or the Reform Party are aware of my personal views on immigration.“I would therefore like to apologise profusely to Nigel Farage and the Reform Party if my personal views have reflected badly on them and brought them into disrepute as this was not my intention.”"

Take our quiz,['Solutions'],Stuart Heritage,28 June 2024 at 0:00 am·7-min read,28,June,2024,00:00:00,7,"Over the last couple of decades, whenever there has been a general election – and there have been a lot of them – the overwhelming likelihood is that it will be so full of gaffes and panic that it will end up being compared to The Thick of It. This is a testament to the painful authenticity of that show and a sad reality of political discourse in the 21st century.However, by anyone’s standards, the 2024 general election has been especially The Thick of Itty. At one point, the show’s creator, Armando Iannucci, pointed out that one fleeting talking point – the Conservative’s plan to let an independent body tackle immigration, to stop MPs from being tripped up on the subject in the media – was basically the plot of the 2007 special The Rise of the Nutters.In other words, it is high time for a quiz.

The Telegraph,The photo ID you need to vote in UK elections,"['What are the voter ID requirements?', 'What types of ID are accepted?', 'Do the rules apply to postal votes?', 'How can I get a voter ID card?', 'What if I do not have a valid ID?', 'Why was voter ID introduced?', 'Why is voter ID so controversial?']",Amy Gibbons,28 June 2024 at 2:54 am·5-min read,28,June,2024,02:54:00,5,"Since May 2023, voters across the UK have been asked to show a form of photographic ID at their local ballot box.The requirement draws on the recommendations of a 2016 report by Lord Pickles, the former communities secretary, which warned there was a risk of “significant abuse” in the electoral system if people could vote under false pretences with little risk of detection.As Labour continues to hold a lead of around 20 percentage points in the latest election opinion polls, The Telegraph sets out everything you need to know about voting rules ahead of the general election on July 4.Here are the acceptable forms of identification you can bring to vote for an election candidate. Read the latest election pollsFollow The Telegraph’s general election live coverageWhat are the voter ID requirements?Everyone wanting to vote in the UK must produce photo ID to take part in certain elections.For voters in England, Scotland and Wales, this includes UK parliamentary elections, by-elections and recall petitions. Those in England also need their ID for local elections.The requirement does not apply to Holyrood, Senedd or council elections in Scotland and Wales. People in Northern Ireland already needed photo ID to vote, so the rule change does not affect them.Voters in both England and Wales also need ID for police and crime commissioner elections.The rule has been applied in stages, beginning with the local elections in England on May 4 2023. This year’s general election will be the first time ID is required for a national poll.The change marks a significant departure from the previous system in most of the UK, where voters only had to verbally confirm their name and address.What types of ID are accepted?Voters are required to show one form of photo ID at the polls, and it does not need to be in date so long as it is recognisable as the person at the ballot box.However, it must be the original version – not a photocopy – and the name on the ID should be the same as it appears on the electoral register.Acceptable forms of voter ID include:Passport issued by the UK, any of the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, a British Overseas Territory, an EEA state or a Commonwealth country (including an Irish Passport Card)Full or provisional driving licence issued by the UK, any of the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, or an EEA stateA Blue BadgeAny identity card bearing the Pass (Proof of Age Standards Scheme) hologramAny of the following travel passes:Older person’s bus pass funded by the GovernmentDisabled person’s bus pass funded by the GovernmentOyster 60+ card funded by the GovernmentFreedom passScottish national entitlement card issued for the purpose of concessionary travel (including a 60+, disabled or under 22s bus pass)60 and over Welsh concessionary travel cardDisabled person’s Welsh concessionary travel cardSenior SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandRegistered blind SmartPass or blind person’s SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandWar disablement SmartPass issued in Northern Ireland60+ SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandHalf fare SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandAny of these government-issued documents:Biometric immigration documentMinistry of Defence Form 90 (Defence Identity Card)National identity card issued by an EEA stateElectoral identity card issued in Northern IrelandVoter authority certificateAnonymous elector’s documentDo the rules apply to postal votes?No. You do not need to have any form of photo ID to vote by post.The deadline to apply for a postal vote was 5pm on June 19 in England, Scotland and Wales, with June 15 the limit in Northern Ireland.However, those who applied on time were asked to provide your National Insurance (NI) number to verify their identity. If you were not able to do this, you will need to explain why.Those who registered in time will automatically be sent their postal ballot and are advised to fill out the forms and post them back for free as soon as they can.There is no formal deadline for this but leaving it too close to polling day may mean your vote could not be delivered in time to be counted.How can I get a voter ID card?The deadline to apply for a VAC passed on June 26 at 5pm.Those who applied on time will receive a voter authority certificate (VAC) either online or by post. To complete the application, a recent digital photo of yourself and your NI number was required.For those without an NI number, it was possible to provide alternative documents as proof of identity, such as a birth certificate, a bank statement or utility bill.What if I do not have a valid ID?Anyone without a form of ID that fits the requirements was still able to apply for a VAC, but must have done so before the 5pm deadline on June 26.This is not a substitute to registering for vote, which must have been done in advance of any application.Why was voter ID introduced?The aim was to stamp out voter fraud by forcing people to prove their identity at the polls.In his Government-commissioned report, Lord Pickles warned that the authorities were in a “state of denial” and “turning a blind eye” to the problem of electoral fraud.Why is voter ID so controversial?The Government has said the change is necessary to curb the “inexcusable potential” for “stealing someone’s vote” by simply quoting their name and address at the ballot box.However, critics say actual claims of electoral fraud are very rare in the UK.In 2019, the last general election year, there were only 33 allegations of impersonation at the polling station out of more than 58 million votes cast, according to the Electoral Reform Society.Opponents of the rule have also warned it will make it more difficult for certain people to vote, including the disabled, transgender and non-binary people, and black and ethnic minority groups."
Yahoo News UK,"Three important UK election issues, explainedRishi Sunak said his leadership is needed in 'uncertain' times. Keir Starmer said the country needs to be 'rebuilt'. So what issues do voters care about most?","['The economy', 'Health', 'Immigration and asylum']",James Cheng-Morris,Updated 28 May 2024 at 11:11 am·5-min read,28,May,2024,11:11:00,5,"After months of speculation, Rishi Sunak confirmed the general election will be held on 4 July.The prime minister said Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer could not be trusted to lead the country through “uncertain” times. He made the economy and combating global security the key elements of his pitch to the nation as he announced the election date.In response, Starmer told voters: “Together we can stop the chaos, we can turn the page, we can start to rebuild Britain.”But amid this “uncertainty” and need to “rebuild”, what do the voters consider the key issues?This chart, produced using YouGov polling over the course of this parliament, offers an insight in the issues voters care most about and how that has ebbed and flowed over time.Compared to when Boris Johnson's Tories won the December 2019 poll, the economy, immigration, defence and tax have grown in importance in the eyes of the electorate. This has come amid the cost of living crisis; small boats crossing the English Channel; the onset of the Ukraine war and wider global instability; and the highest tax burden in 70 years.Housing has also become a bigger concern, with the Renters Reform Bill - in which the government pledged to scrap no-fault evictions - having been paused after Sunak called the election.Meanwhile, the last general election was fought - and won by the Tories - on a single issue: Brexit. Yet the chart shows a clear downturn in its relevance among voters, particularly after a trade deal was agreed with the EU in December 2020.This next chart, meanwhile, highlights what voters have considered the top issues over the past year. By a wide margin, the top three are the economy, health and immigration and asylum.Here, Yahoo News UK breaks down what is behind these issues and how they have ebbed and flowed in importance among voters since the last election in 2019.The economyThe unprecedented lockdown called by Boris Johnson in March 2020 meant the public’s attention shifted to the economy, as demonstrated by the huge spike in the chart above. The then-chancellor Rishi Sunak was forced to implement a £70bn furlough scheme, lasting 18 months, to protect people’s jobs.There was a second almighty economic shock - and rise in public concern - in February 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This caused a further spike in an already turbulent wholesale energy market, driving up costs for suppliers and ultimately customers.Average energy bills eventually reached £2,500 a year (and would have exceeded £4,000 had the government not intervened). This was double the £1,278 consumers were paying before the war and by the time this election takes place, people will still be paying much more than this: £1,568.Energy prices were also a key driver in inflation reaching 11.1% - a 41-year high - by October 2022, though it has since fallen to 2.3%, which is near the Bank of England’s 2.0% target.The third economic shock of this parliament - and most damaging for the Tories - was in October 2022 when Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng's disastrous “mini budget”, containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, prompted an economic crisis. It led to soaring interest rates, and to this day homeowners who are remortgaging are facing significantly higher bills.HealthHealth, like the economy, is another issue which clearly correlated with the beginning of the pandemic. The above chart shows an enormous spike in public concern when COVID cases started to multiply in March 2020, ultimately leading to the nationwide lockdown as the NHS faced collapse.Cases fell that summer, but spikes in the chart can be seen once infections rose again and fresh nationwide lockdowns were imposed in October 2020 and January 2021. By March 2022, likely as concerns over the Omicron variant faded, there was much less concern about health.In January last year, there was a brief spike as the NHS in England experienced the biggest industrial action in its history, with tens of thousands of nurses and ambulance staff walking out simultaneously.As for the state of play going into the election, NHS waiting lists remain higher than they were when Sunak vowed to cut them last year. According to the latest figures, an estimated 7.54 million treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of March, relating to 6.29 million patients.Immigration and asylumSince the last election, the immigration and asylum narrative has largely revolved around one issue: small boats crossing the English Channel.The numbers have risen in most of the intervening years: there were 1,843 crossings in 2019, 8,466 in 2020, 28,526 in 2021, 45,774 in 2022 and 29,437 last year. This year, the number has already passed the 10,000 mark.The regular sharp spikes in the above chart demonstrate how frequently crossings have been in the news, including some occasions when hundreds of migrants have made the dangerous journey in a single day.But it also reflects how the government has made this part of its own agenda. It was Boris Johnson’s government which first announced plans to deport migrants to Rwanda in April 2022. That policy was picked up by Rishi Sunak when he became prime minister in October that year, with Sunak since repeating his pledge to “stop the boats”.But after calling the election, Sunak admitted this week that flights would not take off before the country goes to the polls.Read moreFive important laws that could be dropped due to Sunak's snap election (Yahoo News UK)OPINION - Rishi Sunak has been in last-ditch campaign mode for so long — a General Election is logical (Evening Standard)Door open for Boris Johnson to campaign for Tories, Rishi Sunak signals (PA Media)"

The polls have consistently painted a very bleak picture for the prime minister, with Labour holding on to a double-digit poll lead over his Conservatives.Recent by-election results suggest that Labour is likely to win a landslide victory – but there’s still time for the PM to turn it around.Here’s everything you need to know about Sunak and what’s he’s saying about the biggest issues in British politics right now.Early lifeSunak was born in Southampton in 1980, the eldest of three children. His Indian parents both arrived from East Africa in the 1960s. A football-mad boy whose childhood idol was Matt Le Tissier, Sunak was described by the family’s neighbours as a child with “lovely manners”.In his youngest years, the PM attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. According to a recent biography, fellow pupil Ollie Case said: “He was someone that was talked about. The teachers would say: ‘He’s going to be prime minister'.""But, growing up in the 1980s and 90s, he also remembers experiencing racism. “My mother was obsessed with us not having accents,” Sunak has said.Rishi Sunak was football-mad as a boy growing up in Southampton. (ITV)Sunak's familySunak is married to Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian entrepreneur and multi-billionaire. The pair first met in 2004 at Stanford University, his future wife apparently attracted to his “honesty and integrity”.Five years later they married in a two-day Indian wedding held in Bangalore. The couple have two daughters, Krishna and Anoushka, who will turn 13 and 11 this year, both of whom are largely kept out of the public eye.Sunak attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. (Rishi Sunak, Instagram)His parentsYashvir Sunak, Rishi’s father, was born in Kenya. He arrived in the UK to study medicine and then stayed, becoming an NHS GP. His mother, Usha, was born in Tanzania and is a pharmacist.The couple met in Britain and settled in Southampton in the 1970s. Usha is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.His educationAs a teenager Sunak studied at Winchester College where he was, he says, a self-confessed “geek”. According to a recent biography, the “naughtiest” thing the prime minister did during his school days “was to smuggle a hand-held television into the school so that he did not miss any key games of Euro 96”.The childhood home of Rishi Sunak in Southampton. (Getty Images, photo taken in 2022)Perhaps unsurprisingly for someone with such an unblemished record, he went on to become the school’s head boy. Sunak worked while studying, delivering medicines for his mother’s pharmacy and as a waiter at a local Indian restaurant.After school, Sunk read philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, graduating in 2001 with a first class degree. While still at university he held an internship at the Conservative Party campaign headquarters and joined the party, but went on studying before entering politics.He earned his MBA from Stanford in 2006 as a Fulbright Scholar, meaning he was selected among the most promising candidates from the UK.How much is he worth?As prime minister, Rishi Sunak earns £80,807 on top of a salary of £84,144 for being an MP. But his current income from Westminster pales in comparison to his family’s vast wealth through marriage.The Sunday Times valued the couple’s joint fortune at £730m. Murty's father is the co-founder of Infosys, an Indian tech conglomerate, in which she holds shares estimated at around £430m. Her family is also involved in a £900m business arrangement with Amazon in India, and she is a shareholder of multiple other companies.Rishi Sunak's mother is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.Before entering politics Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and a series of hedge funds. He is also known to have invested in blind trusts, in which investments are made without holders knowing where the funds are located. These arrangements reportedly hold Sunak’s own multi-million-pound fortune.His religionSunak is not only the first prime minister of colour and of Indian heritage but he is also the first practising Hindu to hold the biggest job in UK politics.He has spoken of his pride in his Hindu faith, saying, “that’s how I was raised, and that’s how I am”. He said: “Having faith gives you resilience, gives you strength that is important and it provides an outlook on life which I find particularly valuable.”Sunak on... the NHSThe prime minister’s biggest challenge in office has been the crisis in the NHS - and to many people in the sector his government has been found wanting. “We have not made enough progress,” Sunak said when asked about his commitment to cut NHS waiting lists during an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV. Asked if that meant he had failed, the prime minister replied: “Yes, we have.""Sunak expects to see waiting lists start to reduce this spring, and blames the delays on “industrial action”, as disputes with junior doctors and consultants over pay and conditions continue. Yet Sunak himself has been blamed for holding up a deal that would prevent more walkouts.Sunak, his wife Akshata and daughters Anoushka and Krishna (second left) at Santa Monica Pier, California, on their summer holiday in 2023. (AP)Sunak on… immigrationAccording to the prime minister, illegal migration threatens to “overwhelm” Europe. In June 2023 he claimed his plan to “stop the boats” and tackle illegal immigration was working, but by August 2023 he had changed his mind: “It’s not an easy problem to fix,” he told broadcasters. “I never said we would be able to solve it overnight.”He has staked much of his reputation on the government's Rwanda Bill - his plan to deport asylum seekers to the east African country that finally became law last month, after months of legal and procedural challenges. It has paved the way for deportation flights to get off the ground within weeks.He described his policy, which he says will act as a deterrent to people traffickers, as being “the will of the people” – yet polling suggests low support for such a punitive approach.The policy, coupled with Conservative talk of limits on legal migration, shows that the government is committed to taking a hard line on the issue, despite the risk of alienating more moderate voters.The Rwanda policy is not universally popular. (YouGov)Sunak on... the cost of living crisisThe prime minister has told hard-pressed working families that they will feel some relief from the cost of living crisis as inflation continues to drop following its highs of October 2022. He described the government’s tax cuts as “meaningful” and has welcomed the dip in mortgage rates at the turn of the year.Sunak says falling inflation will have the biggest impact on family budgets “and will start to ease some of those pressures” and that he was right to focus on that figure. However, the global drop in energy prices is probably the biggest factor in easing the hit on wallets - something that the prime minister has no control over.However, the fall in inflation to 2.3% on 22 May this year – the lowest it has been in nearly three years – was likely one of the key factors in persuading Sunak to call a snap election many weeks earlier than experts had predicted.Can we expect more handouts or tax breaks to help balance family budgets? Not according to Sunak, who has warned voters that it’s time to “move on” from government support.Sunak on... pensionsThe triple-lock pensions policy is a tricky one for Sunak – especially since Labour has committed to retaining the policy. Any change to a policy that has become a hallmark of recent Conservative governments would not go down well with the 12 million pensioners it would likely impact – many of whom are lifelong Tory voters.Last November, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said pensions should start being pegged to an average of inflation and wage growth, which would help reduce state spending over time.Sunak’s response to that was ambiguous to say the least: “We are the government that has … delivered the triple lock and it is why, right now, pensions are, depending on how you look at it, £800 or £900 bigger than they otherwise would have been.” He is yet to confirm whether it will appear in the manifesto."
Yahoo News UK,"3 electoral maps that show how disastrous the election could be for the ToriesWith new modelling predicting a Labour victory even bigger than Tony Blair's 1997 landslide, the outlook for Rishi Sunak is not looking good.",['Which Tory ministers are at risk of losing their seats?'],James Cheng-Morris and  James Hockaday,Updated 5 June 2024 at 8:34 am·4-min read,5,June,2024,08:34:00,4,"The outlook was already looking bleak for the Conservative Party when Rishi Sunak called the general election following months of dismal approval ratings that showed little sign of improving.At a campaign event last week, Sunak said he didn't think defeat to Labour was a ""foregone conclusion"", suggesting his main election rival Sir Keir Starmer was taking the British electorate ""for granted"".However, a general election projection released on Monday will have added to the Tories' woes – predicting the biggest win for Labour in the party's history, surpassing even that of Tony Blair's 1997 landslide.The analysis, carried out by YouGov for Sky News, used a relatively new polling technique called Multi-level Regression and Post-stratification (MRP), which is regarded to have had a good track record and can provide detailed predictions at a constituency level basis. The scale of Sunak's problems is demonstrated by the interactive maps below, showing just how much ground the Tories are expected to lose compared to their 2019 victory.Click on the arrows in the top left to switch between the two maps. Check your own constituency to see if it is projected to change handsThe first map above shows the seats won in the 2019 general election, when Boris Johnson led the party to a stunning majority.The wall of Tory blue on the map, compared to the spots of Labour red, is a demonstration of just how far Labour, then led by Jeremy Corbyn, had fallen in public standing. The result was Labour's worst electoral performance since 1935.If you toggle to the second map, the projection by YouGov (which was based on polling carried out between 24 May - 1 June) suggests that Starmer's party is on track to win 422 seats, with the Tories down to just 140.Such a result would be the Conservative Party's worst performance at a general election since 1906. If YouGov's predictions are accurate, Labour winning a 194-seat majority would be the highest number since Conservative Stanley Baldwin won a majority of 208 in 1924.The model suggests the Conservatives could be set for near wipeout across many areas of the country, including London, the North East, the North West, and Wales.It also projects that the Scottish National Party would lose more than half their seats, with Labour returning as the largest party north of the border, and the Liberal Democrats reclaiming its place as the third party of British politics – winning 48 seats.The new figures, released yesterday, came as Reform UK co-founder Nigel Farage announced that he would be returning as the populist party's leader and would stand for election in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. Even before Farage's latest bid, pollsters told Yahoo News that Reform UK could pose a serious threat to the Tories by splitting the vote and potentially handing even more seats to Labour.The YouGov projection follows a similar poll by modelling site Electoral Calculus, which came out on 31 May. The polling also compares the 2019 result with Electoral Calculus' projection.It predicts that Labour is on course to win an even bigger majority of 319 seats - with Starmer's party picking up 485 MPs and the Tories way behind with 66. The modelling shows the Lib Dems getting very close to the Conservative Party, with 59 seats.While Electoral Calculus' polling, based on opinion polls from 8 May to 20 May, returns a different set of projections to YouGov's, both clearly indicate the scale of the problem facing Sunak.The Electoral Calculus model has predicted Sir Keir Starmer's Labour will win a massive majority.

He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""This is one poll - we’ve actually, I think, had four other polls published in the last 24 hours - none of which have had Reform ahead, not even all of which have had Reform gaining ground, but quite a couple of them certainly suggesting it’s also got very close.""He said it may not be the case that Reform are ahead - and could be on average four or five points behind. But he said: ""This is still bad news for the Conservatives. The only way Rishi Sunak can hope to get even to base camp in narrowing the lead that Labour have started off with this campaign was to squeeze the Reform vote.""He added: ""Rather than making progress, things are actually going backwards, not least of course because of Nigel Farage’s decision to fight this campaign.""With many speculating that Reform UK with Farage at the helm could ""beat"" the Tories, Yahoo News UK takes a look.What do the latest polls say?YouGov’s voting intention tracker, updated on Tuesday, suggests the Tories and Reform UK are neck and neck.With Labour well ahead on 38%, the Tories are trailing on 18% – compared to a high of 53% under Boris Johnson in 2020 – with Reform UK just behind on 17% and the Liberal Democrats on 15%.However, there are multiple polls taking place at any one time by a number of different companies.According to the PA news agency, an average of all polls that were carried out wholly or partly during the seven days to June 13 puts Labour on 43%, 21 points ahead of the Conservatives on 22%, followed by Reform on 14%, the Lib Dems on 10% and the Greens on 6%.And while Reform’s average is up one percentage point on the figure for the previous week and the Tories are down one point, there is still an eight-point gap, on average, between the two.Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?Unless something remarkable happens, in short: 'No' - and that's because of the first past the post (FPTP) voting system in which the candidate with the largest number of votes in their constituency is elected.According to the Electoral Reform Society, which is against FPTP, this system leads to a situation where “even if millions of voters support the same party, if they are thinly spread out across the UK they may only get the largest number of votes in a couple of these contests – so only win a few MPs"".“Tens of thousands of voters supporting a different party, but who live near each other, could end up with more MPs. This means the number of MPs a party has in parliament rarely matches their popularity with the public.”Rishi Sunak on the campaign trail on Wednesday. (AFP via Getty Images)Farage knows this well. As the leader of UKIP in the 2015 election, he saw his party win 12.6% of the nationwide vote and one seat. The Liberal Democrats won 7.9% of the vote... and eight seats.Indeed, YouGov last week released a poll – put together using the multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) surveying technique, from a sample size of nearly 60,000 respondents – which suggested the Tories would win just 140 seats, having won 365 in 2019. But this is still 140 more than the zero it projected Reform UK to win, in spite of its strong polling figures.The model had Reform UK ""performing strongly in a number of seats but still a long way off winning in any"", with projected second-placed finishes in 27 constituencies.YouGov's MRP projection. (YouGov)Granted, this model was formed between 24 May and 1 June, before Farage's headline-grabbing intervention on Monday last week in which he announced he would be standing as an MP.But, even as Reform UK polls closer than ever to the Tories, it's difficult to imagine the party winning more than a handful of seats.Chris Hopkins, director at polling firm Savanta, told Yahoo News UK that in one respect, Reform UK is at an advantage compared to Ukip in 2015 because ""Ukip took votes from both Labour and the Conservatives, and we are not seeing that with Reform UK – they are all coming from the Conservatives.""That is the consequence of Rishi Sunak making immigration a centrepiece of the campaign and failing to deliver on it. Even if you have voters that are neutral on immigration, they would say the small boats policy has been a disaster.""But even so, Hopkins said, Reform UK is still ""at a huge electoral disadvantage"" in that its votes are not very concentrated, they are very evenly spread.""There are going to be some races where Reform UK is strong - the Nigel Farage factor in Clacton is really interesting - but realistically its ceiling is five seats: and that’s a high ceiling.""Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey on a campaign visit in Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire, on Wednesday.

(The Guardian)However, it remains unlikely the Lib Dems will finish second. YouGov’s MRP poll projected the party performing strongly, winning 48 seats. This would be up 37 from 2019, but still nowhere near the Tories’ projected 140.However, amid all this talk about projections, it’s worth remembering they are still only polls and not a definite indicator of how people will vote on 4 July. The 1992 and 2015 elections are notable examples of how polling didn’t match the end results of Tory wins.What is proportional representation?Proportional representation, as defined by the UK parliament, is an electoral system ""in which the distribution of seats corresponds closely with the proportion of the total votes cast for each party. For example, if a party gained 40% of the total votes, a perfectly proportional system would allow them to gain 40% of the seats.""This differs from the first past the post system, as set out above, in that a relatively high vote share rarely corresponds with increased seats for the smaller parties. In 2019, for example, the Lib Dems won 11.5% of the vote but only 1.7% – 11 – of the 650 seats.Unsurprisingly, both Reform UK and the Lib Dems support proportional representation.The Lib Dems this week made it part of their manifesto, with the party saying it would introduce the single transferrable vote method, a form of proportional representation which allows electors to rank their preference of candidates on the ballot.The party previously sought to change the UK’s voting system while in the coalition government under then-leader Nick Clegg, but voters rejected the plan in a 2011 referendum.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

The term is also sometimes used to refer to the election itself, as in ‘they could not win at the ballot box’.CampaignThe time before an election in which politicians persuade people to vote for them. In the case of the 2024 election in the UK, parliament was dissolved on the 30 May and the election will take place on 4 July.CanvassingGoing round a particular area trying to persuade people to vote for one party or the other.In UK elections, this is often done by volunteers knocking on people’s doors.Capital gains taxCapital gains tax is a tax on profit when people sell assets that have increased in value.In the 2024 election, the Conservatives have promised that landlords who sell to sitting tenants will be spared capital gains tax on the proceeds, while Labour has left the door open to raising capital gains.Child benefitChild benefit is a benefit paid to parents with children under 16 (or under 20 in approved education or training).The Conservatives have promised to increase the threshold at which high earners start to lose the benefit from £60,000 to £120,000.Sir Keir Starmer, like the Conservatives, has pledged not to raise VAT. (Photo by Stefan Rousseau/PA Images via Getty Images)CoalitionA coalition government is a government formed jointly by more than one political party (for example, by the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives in 2010).ConstituencyThe geographical area that is represented by each MP in the House of Commons.ECHRThe European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is an international convention which protects human rights in Europe.The Conservative manifesto stopped short of promising to withdraw from the ECHR, which would have made plans such as the plan to deport migrants to Rwanda easier.Exit pollA poll conducted outside polling stations just after people have voted on election day.On election day, the results of Britain’s exit poll are published just after polls close at 10pm and tend to give a more accurate prediction of the result than previous polls produced throughout the campaign.First past the postThe first past the post system is used to elect MPs to the House of Commons.The candidate with the most votes in each constituency becomes MP, and the party with the most MPs becomes the government.This can mean that the winning party actually has a minority of votes cast: in 2019, the Conservatives had 43.6% of the vote.Hung parliamentA hung parliament is where no party has enough seats to form an overall majority. For example, both the 2010 election and 2017 elections resulted in hung parliament.In 2010, the Conservatives formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, while in 2017, the Conservatives formed a minority government with a 'confidence and supply' agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).Income tax thresholdThe thresholds between the tax-free allowance, basic rate tax and higher rates of tax.Both parties have said they will continue the freeze on income tax thresholds brought in under the Conservatives, which means people pay more tax as more and more people are pushed into higher tax brackets if wages rise.MajorityA party with a majority – more than half of the seats in the House of Commons – has won the election.The number of votes by which an individual MP wins a constituency is also referred to as their majority.ManifestoPolitical parties publish manifestos before a general election, with a set of policies that the party stands for and aims to implement if elected.Manifesto pledges are not legally binding.Marginal seatA seat in which the incumbent MP won by a small majority, meaning a swing is more likely than in a so-called ‘safe seat’ where the MP had a large majority.Net zeroThe UK Government has set a goal for Britain’s emissions to reach net zero – where emission and removal of greenhouse gases reaches equilibrium – by 2050.All major parties are expected to stick to this goal, barring Reform UK.Opinion pollAn opinion poll is a research survey (usually carried out on a representative sample of the electorate) to gauge likely results in an election.Poll‘The polls’ refers to the places where people vote in an election: exit polls and opinion polls refer to two kinds of survey used to predict election results.Postal voteAn absentee vote where the vote is sent in by post.At the 2019 general election, 17.2% of voters across the UK used a postal ballot.Proxy voteA vote where a person who can’t make it to the booth appoints someone to vote for them.In the 2019 election, 0.6% of voters appointed a proxy.PsephologyPsephology is the scientific study of elections and voting and is used to predict and analyse election results.Polling dayThe day when the country places their vote: in the UK 2024 election, this is July 4.PurdahBefore British elections, the country enters purdah, officially known as the ‘pre-election period of sensitivity’.Purdah means that politicians (both local and national) and other people such as civil servants face restrictions on what they can do and announce.Ministers who remain in office can’t announce new funding, or new policies, or anything which might sway voters or make the government more popular.The idea is that public money cannot be spent on the election.Spoiled ballotA ballot paper which has been marked wrongly (for instance with a vote for more than one candidate) will not be counted.Sometimes people spoil ballots deliberately as a protest vote to show dissatisfactionSwing‘Swing’ is the change in voter support for a political party between one election and the next.It is used to analyse the performance of parties in different areas.Tax burdenThe tax burden refers to the total amount of taxes paid by a group (in this case the UK as a whole) as a proportion of total income.The tax burden is currently at its highest in 70 years according to the OECD.The Equality ActThe 2010 Equality Act protects people against discrimination in Britain.The Conservatives want to ‘tweak’ the Act so that sex-based protections only apply on the basis of someone’s biological sex.Triple lockThe triple lock is a guarantee introduced to the state pension in 2010 so it would not lose value in real terms.The guarantee means that the state pension will rise by the highest out of average earnings, inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) or 2.5%.Triple lock plusThe ‘triple lock plus’ is a Conservative policy, which would see the tax-free pension allowance rise every year in line with the triple lock of average wages, inflation, or 2.5% – whichever is highest, to prevent pensioners being pulled into paying income tax.TurnoutTurnout refers to the percentage of people eligible to vote who turn out to vote on election day.In the 2019 election, for example, 67.3% of those eligible turned out to vote.VATValue added tax is added to goods and services sold by VAT-registered companies, and is the third-largest source of government income after income tax and national insurance.Both Labour and the Conservatives have pledged not to raise VAT.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

The Independent,Pollster warns only one election question to be answered: ‘How big is the Tory loss?’,[],David Maddox and Alicja Hagopian,28 June 2024 at 2:30 am·3-min read,28,June,2024,02:30:00,3,"A leading pollster has warned that defeat for the Tories in the general election next week is now unavoidable and the only question remaining is how much Rishi Sunak’s party loses by.The assessment by Techne UK’s chief executive Michela Morizzo - Italy’s equivalent of Professor Sir John Curtice - comes as her company’s tracker poll for The Independent shows that Labour goo into the final seven-day stretch with a 22 point lead over the Tories.Labour are on 41 per cent (down one) with the Tories languishing on 19 per cent for a third week in a row and Reform UK just two points behind still on 17 per cent. The Lib Dems are on 12 per cent and Greens on 5 per cent meaning that the five main parties almost completely unchanged from last week.Rishi Sunak has been mentioned in barely 1% of the Conservatives’ online adverts (Phil Noble/PA) (PA Wire)It means that the final onslaught unleashed by Rishi Sunak in the head-to-head debate on Wednesday attacking Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer on tax and immigration had almost no impact,, the same as most of his tactics throughout a problematic campaign.Instead, the Tories continue to be dogged by their own self inflicted wounds particularly the gambling scandal and before that Mr Sunak leaving the D-Day commemorations early.Ms Morizzo now believes that there is nothing he can do to turn things around in such a small space of time.She told The Independent: “With less than one full week before the British electorate go to the general election ballot boxes our regular tracker poll of Westminster voting intentions confirms what we have known now for sometime. There continues to be no closing of any gap between Labour and Conservatives continuing at a 22 per cent Labour lead.“If this wasn’t bad enough though for the Conservatives the steady rise of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK throughout the campaign to its position now 17 percent points of national vote - a rise of four to five polling points across the last four weeks will further squeeze and damage the Conservatives already faltering chances.“There can be no doubt that the data shows clearly it is now too late to save the Conservatives - the election is lost for them, the only question is how great this loss will ultimately be. Abstention rate and Reform UK voters will make the difference!”To underline the point, Electoral Calculus predicts that if this poll was the result of an election Labour would have a majority of 268, the Lib Dems would be the official oppposition with 75 seats, the Tories stranded in third with 48 seats and Reform on a stunning 19 seats.The breakdown of the data continues to make depressing reading for the Tories. For a third week in a row Leave voters from 2016 are more likely to vote Reform than Conservative by 28 per cent to 22 percent.Less than four in 10 (38 per cent) of the Tory voters from 2019 have stuck with the party now, while Labour leads in every age, education and socio-economic category.In a sign that voters are despondent about the choices as many as a third (33 per cent) may not vote with 24 per cent deciding not to cast their vote and another 9 per cent uncertain."

It had looked likely that Rishi Sunak would wait until the autumn to call the next election, but the Prime Minister announced in a rain-sodden speech outside of Downing Street on May 22 that July 4 was the chosen date.Read the latest election pollsFollow The Telegraph’s live general election coverageMany assumed Mr Sunak would want more time for the new Rwanda deterrent and recent tax cuts to take effect, having described a ballot in the second half of the year as his “working assumption”.But speculation reached fever pitch in Westminster when the Conservatives refused to rule out an election being called that day. That afternoon, an umbrella-less Mr Sunak announced his snap election decision and set in motion the vote to happen six weeks later on July 4.The choice means that Mr Sunak will have been in No 10 for 618 days by the polling date and has been called a “mistake” by figures like Prof Sir John Curtice, the polling expert.Why is there an election now?Tory figures close to general election planning had also been working under the assumption there was not going to be a summer ballot, but that all changed on May 22.Lord Cameron cut a trip to Albania short in order to return to a Cabinet meeting and Grant Shapps delayed a flight to a Nato meeting two hours to be there.On the day of the announcement, news came that the rate of inflation had fallen even further than expected, which Mr Sunak hailed as a sign that “everything is heading in the right direction”.With the Government’s record perhaps at its strongest on the economy, the Prime Minister was keen to use the news as a launchpad for triggering the election – but what else played into his decision?Key factors for the Prime Minister would have included whether economic statistics was continuing to improve, and whether polling and focus group research suggested that voters were feeling the positive effects of the National Insurance cuts, crediting the Tories for the boost.Getting Rwanda deportation flights off the ground also strengthened the case for going to the polls in the summer, along with a steady decline in the NHS elective waiting list.It had been rumoured that figures in Downing Street were mulling over whether it would be in the Tories’ interests to trigger a ballot sooner rather than later, despite being way behind Labour in the polls.What happens after the general election?Polls will close at 10pm on July 4.Shortly afterwards, the BBC will publish its exit poll of voters in approximately 150 constituencies around England, Scotland and Wales. This provides an indication of who will win once all the ballots have been counted.Over the course of the night, votes are tallied up and the winners of each constituency are announced.If the Conservatives retain a majority in the new Parliament, the party will continue in office and resume normal business.But if Labour or another party wins a clear majority, the Prime Minister and his Cabinet will resign and the King will invite the winning party’s leader to form a new Government.In the case of a hung Parliament, where no single party has a majority, Mr Sunak will remain in power and be given the chance to form a government.The Prime Minister could negotiate with other parties to form a coalition, govern as a minority, negotiate a confidence and supply deal with another party, or resign.In the case of his resignation, the leader of the largest opposition party would be invited to form a government as a minority administration or in coalition with another party.The state opening of Parliament will be Wednesday July 17, with summer recess due to start on July 23 and not ending until September.It has been reported that Sir Keir Starmer plans to delay or cut short recess in a bid to get on with his legislative agenda, in the event of a Labour victory.On July 18, the new Prime Minister will host 50 Nato leaders at Blenheim Palace for a key alliance summit.It will be a key moment to show themselves to the world as Britain’s new leader.Why was the general election not on the same day as the local elections?The general election could have been called on May 2 – the same day as the locals – but Mr Sunak made the decision to avoid a spring poll.The Institute for Government pointed out that a spring election would avoid the risk that “a heavy defeat in the local elections could increase pressure on the Prime Minister – including from within his party – and make it difficult to regain momentum ahead of an election that would by then be less than a year away”.However, that opportunity passed. On March 14, the Prime Minister ruled out a national ballot on May 2, confirming there “won’t be a general election on that day”.It was thought that heavy losses at the locals could tempt restless Tory MPs to mount a challenge against their leader.However, despite a dire set of results for the Conservatives, resulting in hundreds of council seats lost, the rebels appeared to back off.What happens next? Following Mr Sunak’s announcement on May 22, Parliament was prorogued and dissolved eight days later on May 30 after the Prime Minister was granted permission by the King.Prorogation happened on May 24, in line with the 2022 Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act that sets out polling day to take place 25 working days following the dissolution on May 30, landing the general election on July 4.Election candidates use the six-week lead up to ballot day to campaign for their parties.Mr Sunak, Sir Keir Starmer and many other political figures have been campaigning up and down the country. They have also taken part in TV election debates in a bid to win over voters and released their 2024 party manifestos, starting with the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives. It is up to each party when to publish its manifesto, but an analysis by the Institute for Government shows that all Labour and Conservative manifestos since 1997 have been launched between 18 and 29 days before the election.How are general elections called?It is up to the Prime Minister to decide when to hold a national vote, but this power has only been restored in recent years.In 2011, the Fixed Term Parliaments Act effectively put the House of Commons in charge, with general elections held every five years unless a majority of MPs willed it otherwise.For an election to be called early, two thirds of the House had to back the plans. This is how Theresa May’s snap election was triggered in 2017. Alternatively, MPs could spark a ballot by passing a vote of no confidence in the Government.After trying and failing three times to secure the necessary two thirds majority for an early vote in 2019, the Tories opted to circumvent the law with a new purpose-built piece of legislation – the Early Parliamentary General Election Act – which required only a simple majority to pass. This paved the way for Boris Johnson’s snap election in 2019.The Government went on to repeal the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, replacing it with the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act. This new law stripped the Commons of its power to block an early ballot, putting the Prime Minister back in control.Traditionally, the Prime Minister travels to Buckingham Palace to request the dissolution of Parliament, before returning to Downing Street to announce the forthcoming election.How often are elections called? Each Parliament must be dissolved for a general election by the fifth anniversary of the day it first met.This measure was passed under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act by the 2011 coalition government, which set in stone the five-year periods between general elections.Elections may be held earlier – such occurred in 2017 with Theresa May and 2019 by Mr Johnson following a Brexit deadlock – under special circumstances.However, local elections such as the May 2024 by-elections and mayoral elections operate on a different time scale. Who can vote in the general election?The vast majority of UK adults can vote in a general election.In order to vote, you must:be registered to votebe 18 or over on the day of the election (‘polling day’)be a British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizenbe a resident at an address in the UK or Gibraltar, or living abroad and registered as an overseas voter (it is also possible to register if you have no fixed address)not be legally excluded from voting (for example, if you are serving a prison sentence)When should I register to vote?The deadline for registering to vote has now passed. Registration usually stays open until midnight at the end of the 12th working day before polling day, meaning the window closed on June 18 at 11.59pm. The deadline to vote by post passed the following day at 5pm.The deadline to apply for proxy vote also passed on June 26.When will polling take place?Parliament was dissolved a few days after the election announcement and polling day takes place 25 working days after that.The Civil Service has entered “purdah” – the period between an election being called and polling day – which involves strict restrictions on the work of officials to ensure that Whitehall resources are not being used to benefit any party in particular."
The Telegraph,Blair caused Britain’s house price crisis – and Starmer will be no better,[],Ben Wilkinson,28 June 2024 at 2:00 am·3-min read,28,June,2024,02:00:00,3,"Reform blames immigration and Labour blames the Tories – but what is really to blame for the struggle young people now face to buy a home?Sir Keir Starmer seems confident that his party can end the nation’s house price crisis and help more of us realise the dream of homeownership. But I suspect a generation of would-be first-time buyers will be deeply disappointed.The last time that Labour won a landslide victory in 1997, house prices proceeded to rocket – soaring 152pc while Tony Blair was in Number 10, according to analysis by estate agents Savills.In contrast, house price growth has been relatively modest under the Tories – rising 8pc under David Cameron, dropping 1pc under Theresa May, increasing 10pc under Boris Johnson and falling 8pc under Rishi Sunak.House prices had tanked under John Major, then interest rates finally started to fall under New Labour. This encouraged buyers and investors to spend more, and banks to lend more.House prices boomed, and so too did buy-to-let. It was at this point that the house price crisis began, like a runaway train.It looks very likely Sir Keir will also inherit an economy in recovery next month. Interest rates will start to fall this year and things could again start to look rosy very quickly – property prices included. House prices have proved remarkably resilient, surviving the recent mortgage rate squeeze. Surely, the only way is up?But this is news Labour won’t want to hear. It wants to make homes more affordable for buyers and has pledged to boost supply, saying it will build more homes and ensure more of them are allocated as affordable housing. It will also bring back mandatory building targets for local councils, put more resources into planning and free up more green belt land.Although, Labour, of course, won’t be building any homes. It faces the same challenges as the Tories, and its policies aren’t much different from theirs either. Neither can it compel developers to build any.For housing supply to increase, the nation’s housebuilders need to have real incentive. They aren’t going to lay a single brick until they know they can make money.Data this week revealed that since 2015, planning permission has been granted for one million homes that still have not been built. Developers sit on land and eke out homes, controlling their supply to maximise profits.Britain is also facing a skills shortage. Homes are increasingly expensive to construct and there aren’t enough people qualified to build them.There are surprisingly few ways that governments can help buyers by increasing supply and cooling house price growth. So if Labour cannot build more homes, what can it do?The only thing that is really in its power is to meddle with taxes. With Labour’s manifesto scant on detail, imaginations are running wild as to what the party might choose to do if it secures a “supermajority” next week.Any raid on capital gains or stamp duty will deter owners from selling and shut yet more buyers out of the market. The best thing Labour can do is steer well clear of any interference in taxes which will clog the market.Labour wants to appease the younger generation who believe it’s the Tories’ fault they can’t buy a house. The reality is that governments have little to no control over house prices.Whichever strings they pull, they will always be dictated by economic forces – and whatever buyers are willing and able to pay.If wages increase, so will house prices. If stamp duty is cut, this will be priced in. If mortgage affordability improves, buyers will simply stretch themselves further.If Labour, as it says, wants to be the party of wealth creation, it will have to accept that that means house prices will have to keep on rising."
PA Media: UK News,Steve Baker to launch Tory leadership bid if party loses and he keeps seat,[],"Sophie Wingate, PA Deputy Political Editor",27 June 2024 at 10:05 am·4-min read,27,June,2024,10:05:00,4,"Tory minister Steve Baker will mount a bid to replace Rishi Sunak as party leader should he lead the Conservatives to defeat on July 4 as expected, it is understood.The Northern Ireland minister hinted at a leadership run if he retains his Wycombe seat – where he was re-elected with a slim 4,214 majority in 2019 – at the General Election.He told the PA news agency: “One thing at a time. I want to represent the people of Wycombe the best that I can, as I always have done.“Then let’s see what happens.”🙏Obviously it’s a difficult election, but the reaction on the doorstep has certainly been more positive than the polls would suggest.👉""Something is going on which is bigger than Brexit in the UK, the Conservative Party. That thing, I believe, is the collapse of the…— Rt Hon Steve Baker FRSA 🗽 (@SteveBakerFRSA) June 27, 2024It is understood that he will announce his intentions if the electoral hammering the polls are predicting occurs and Mr Sunak is forced to give up the party’s reins.Mr Baker joins other hopefuls – including Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch and Home Secretary James Cleverly – in jostling for the position with a week to go until polling day.Labour said the manoeuvring showed the Tories were putting “their self-interest and leadership ambitions first”.The contest to pick Mr Sunak’s successor could shape the party for years to come as right-wingers and more centrist Tories battle it out.Security minister Tom Tugendhat on Thursday twice refused to rule out taking a tilt at the top job, when asked in an ITV interview.Seen as being on the moderate wing of the party, he previously ran for the leadership in 2022.Mr Baker cited his experience leading Tory Brexit, Covid-19 lockdowns and net zero rebellions as reasons he would be a suitable candidate.He told HuffPost UK: “It’s a fact my colleagues sent for me four times to provide leadership through crisis to success: before and after the referendum, in Covid and in relation to the cost of net zero.”Earlier this week, he admitted the Tories’ election campaign has gone “badly” and that its double-digit poll deficit is “extremely worrying”.He said “things have gone wrong” for the party and that he is standing for re-election to try to “sort this mess out”.Mr Baker also complained that the Prime Minister “didn’t consult me” on calling a summer election.After Mr Sunak surprised Westminster by announcing the July 4 poll in May, Mr Baker went ahead with a holiday in Greece rather than campaigning in his constituency.The Tory campaign has in recent days been overshadowed by the row over the alleged use of inside information to bet on the timing of the July 4 poll, dampening Mr Sunak’s hopes of putting a dent in Labour’s 21-point average poll lead.Mr Baker was the first serving minister to call for those who placed bets on the election date to be suspended by the party, with the Prime Minister later pulling support from candidates Craig Williams and Laura Saunders.Asked whether he wanted to be part of the battle for the soul of the Conservative Party, Mr Baker told Times Radio on Tuesday: “That’s why I’m standing.“I’ve said to numerous people on their doorstep that … I recognise things have gone wrong and that I would love to have the opportunity to rise to their expectations of giving them the Conservative Party and the Conservative government which they expect. Pragmatic, professional and yet principled…“I would very much like to have the chance to sort this mess out.”Tory MPs usually vote to select the top two candidates, who are then put forward to the party membership, although the rules and timeline of the race would be set out by the backbench 1922 Committee.Mr Baker was first elected to represent Wycombe in 2010 but faces a tough contest to keep his seat next week.Labour’s deputy national campaign co-ordinator Ellie Reeves said: “While the Tories put their self-interest and leadership ambitions first, it’s clearer than ever: if the Conservatives are given another five years, the chaos will just continue.“This changed Labour Party is ready to serve the British people – country first, party second. The public has the chance for change with Labour if they vote for it on July 4.”"

I just don’t think that should happen.”He said the TV showdown had been “fiery”, but insisted “I’m not motivated by personal animosity (towards Mr Sunak) in the slightest”.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on a campaign visit to Denby Pottery Factory, Ripley (Joe Giddens/PA)The Prime Minister defended the latest Conservative campaign advert when challenged over its controversial imagery.He told broadcasters in Derbyshire: “This is an incredibly important election, and there’s an important choice for people.

The Guardian,"‘We’re taxing non-doms, not condoms!’: Labour strives to reconnect with disengaged voters",[],Daniel Boffey in Hull,27 June 2024 at 2:00 am·7-min read,27,June,2024,02:00:00,7,"Even during a general election campaign with projections of historic – even unprecedented – results, people cannot always be relied upon to give their full attention.“We met a guy who said he was going to vote Labour but wouldn’t now because he had just heard that we were taxing condoms,” said Labour’s Karl Turner, who was first voted in as the MP for Hull East in 2010 and is standing for re-election this time.“I said, ‘condoms?’ ‘Yeah,’ he said: ‘I just heard on that [pointing to the TV] that you are taxing condoms, and I’m not having it. You’re not getting my vote.’ It was Terence [Turner’s parliamentary assistant] here who worked it out.“‘We’re taxing non-doms, not condoms,’ I said. ‘Oh,’ he said. ‘Like the prime minister’s wife? Ah.’ He calls out: ‘Margaret: they’re taxing non-doms, not condoms.’”It was one vote saved for Labour in East Yorkshire – but as the general election moves from what observers have described as the “air war”, where messaging is all-important, to the “ground war”, where mobilising the voters to actually visit the ballot box is key, it is the significant tranche of voters who have entirely switched off that worries Turner.Hull East was the only constituency at the last general election where under half (49.3%) of the electorate turned out to vote. Within Turner’s constituency is the ward of Marfleet, which has a strong claim to be the most politically disillusioned place in Britain. Turnout was 11.6% in the last local elections.Disillusionment and distrust when it comes to politics and politicians is a UK-wide phenomenon, and is strong in Hull East.On Monday, the retired women at the Marfleet community centre were having an afternoon researching their family histories on laptops. “They don’t give a damn about the people below ’em,” said Lesley Robinson, a retired personal assistant. “What’s the point? They all lie.”“They tell you what they think you want to know – they treat us as stupid,” added Sue Hurst, 78. “You are born in hope and die in despair.” Robinson agreed, interjecting: “They treat us like children or worse than that. At least children get pocket money.”Pauline French, 70, who retired last year as the cleaner at the centre, puffed out her cheeks. “I will, but my husband and son won’t vote,” she said. “People just don’t bother.”It is not that the people here don’t have problems. Marfleet is one of the most socially disadvantaged places in a city with plenty of issues, but there is a complete absence of belief that anyone is going to do anything about it.A focus group of non-voters in the city, carried out by More In Common for the Guardian, offers further evidence of the depth of those feelings.“I work for the NHS so nothing good comes out of elections for me … no one cares,” said Hameder, a trainee nurse.Michael, a service engineer, described politicians as “brainless monkeys”. Sam, who is hoping to start an apprenticeship, explained she felt bad sometimes about not taking an interest in politics and that her friends told her off for it, but that it was hard when “everything does feel in so much disrepair … Everyone just hates politics and hates Rishi Sunak.”The immediate concern for Labour beyond Hull is that, with Keir Starmer’s party so far ahead in the polls, the apathetic will be joined by many more who will assume there is little point in voting given the apparent certainty of the result.It is a nagging doubt in Labour HQ that new polling from More in Common polling will do little to assuage.Rather than asking individuals about their own engagement with politics, which people often overstate, respondents were asked about their friends and family.Questioned as to whether their friends and family were more excited or more apathetic about the election, Britons were almost three times more likely to say apathetic. Asked if their friends and family thought the general election would make a meaningful difference to the country, barely a quarter (26%) agreed.Most starkly, 41% said family and friends were more disillusioned with this general election compared with previous ones, while only 7% said they were less disillusioned.Voter turnout is a Hull-wide problem. Three out of the four constituencies with the lowest turnout in 2019 were Hull seats, with the other being Chorley, where the Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, stood unopposed.Turner was born and bred in the constituency and is regarded locally as someone who cares, but it is difficult not to take the turnout figures personally at times.Speaking from his constituency office, located between a branch of Pizza Mafia and the Witham Tandoori, the 53-year-old said: “I was on a doorstep the other day and the guy said: ‘I won’t be voting Labour.’ I said: ‘Oh, why is that?’ ‘It’s because I don’t like you.’ ‘Oh right,’ I said. ‘That’s very honest of you. That’s what my wife says as well’.“As I was walking down the path, he said: ‘I thought you would come out with a fucking clever line.’ I said: ‘May I ask you how you will vote, for my data?’ He said: ‘I’m going to sit down and work out which bastard can stop you.’ He then said, real genuinely: ‘Can you help me with that? Who’s coming second?’”It has become Turner’s habit to check the weather for polling day, in the hope that a clear sky could encourage people out.But he believes beyond this election that a great challenge for Labour will be to convince people politicians are not “all the same” – a perception that he believes was deepened by the failed promises of Brexit and Boris Johnson.He said: “I think the big problem is if you’re in a low-wage economy, then people have got bigger things to worry about: paying the rents, paying the mortgages, looking after the family, feeding the kids. Going along to the polling station hardly matters.”Turner notes that there was real enthusiasm for voting for leave in the Brexit referendum, with the leave campaign attracting 73.4% of the vote in Hull East. Across the city, turnout was 62.9%.There was also excitement for Johnson in 2019: Turner gave him the moniker “Boris the magnificent” because of the impression on the doorsteps. Turner was close to losing his seat to the Tories.defaultBut that trust turned to dust, he said, after Partygate and the realisation that the most notable impact of Brexit on Hull had been a 50% loss in catching quotas for the city’s biggest deep-sea trawler due to changes in access to Norway’s waters.Turner believes Labour’s cautious approach to its manifesto is the right one. Further empty promises would only deepen the problem, he says. He suggests that part of the solution might be to make it easier for people to vote by allowing them to vote over a number of days, for example.But the rise of Reform, which is expected to come from nowhere and take second pace in Hull East, highlights to him how important it will be for the next Labour government to be truly radical and prove they are different.“People in Hull East should be voting because, actually, it makes a real difference in areas like [this] to their lives,” he said. “To sort of persuade them to get from … that feeling of it doesn’t matter to actually giving them something to vote for is a difficulty.“I’ve said to Keir and anybody else who was prepared to listen: ‘Look, what we need is policy, which really makes a difference in their lives.’”The Sure Start centres of the last Labour government that helped young parents were the sort of initiative that Turner said gave people a stake in the election, but that they had needed more time to bed in.For now, Turner can only hope that the votes are there on 4 July to make change possible – and that Labour’s message on taxing non-doms and the rest is getting through."

It is now looking ever-more likely that Sir Keir Starmer will be prime minister by next Friday.Nigel Farage may yet have a good election night as Reform UK are currently in third place in the polls. The polling for the party has slipped following the controversy over Farage’s comments about the war in Ukraine but the party is still some five percentage points ahead of the Lib Dems.There was even further grim reading for the Tories on 26 June, when a separate poll conducted by Ipsos for the Evening Standard claimed that a record seven out of 10 Britons do not like the Conservative Party.Yahoo News UK summaries the positions of the parties according to five separate opinion polls.No major changes show Labour on course for large victoryA poll by Savanta puts Labour on 42% – 21 points ahead of the Tories, who are on 21%. Ipsos also puts Labour on 42%, compared to 19% for the Tories, while JL Partners give similar results, with Labour on 41% and the Tories on 25%.A Verian poll shows Labour on 38%, with the Tories on 21%, while Survation show Labour on 41%, compared to a historic low of 18% for the Tories.An average of opinion polls from February to June this year. (PA)An average of all polls with survey work completed during the seven days to 26 June puts Labour on 41%, 21 points ahead of the Conservatives on 20%, followed by Reform on 16%, the Lib Dems on 11% and the Greens on 6% – unchanged on the figures for the previous week.On 22 May, the day Sunak called the election, the seven-day averages stood at Labour 45%, Conservatives 23%, Reform 11%, Lib Dems 9% and Greens 6%.Tories could slump to lowest number of seatsEarlier this month, three major polls showed the Tories were on course for a historic defeat, with one projection showing the party potentially slumping to the lowest number of seats since the party was formed.Using the multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP) technique, which enables projections to be made at constituency level, YouGov's polling for Sky News projected Labour being on course to achieve a 200-seat majority. The poll suggested Labour would secure 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.The YouGov poll for Sky News.A More In Common UK poll for the News Agents podcast showed Labour projecting to finish on 406 seats, with the Conservatives on 155.Meanwhile, polling by Savanta and Electoral Calculus for the Telegraph, showed Sunak could become the first sitting prime minister to lose his seat of Richmond and Northallerton to Labour. It put Labour on 516 seats, with the Tories on just 53.What are the latest odds?As of 26 June, Oddschecker – a website which compares odds across different bookmakers – had Labour at 1/41 to win the most seats. To put that in context, this is seen as so likely that a £10 bet would return just £10.24.The Conservatives are 80/1 to win the most seats, a scenario seen as so unlikely that a £10 punt would return £810.A Conservative majority government is also seen as so unlikely (125/1) that Oddschecker sees a Reform UK government as more likely (100/1).What went wrong for the Tories?YouGov's voting intention tracker between January 2020 and June 2024. (YouGov)So, why have the polls changed so dramatically? It's worth looking back on an extremely eventful four-and-a-half years in UK politics.According to YouGov's voting intention tracker (see chart, above), Tory support peaked at 53%, with Labour on 32%, in April 2020, months after the party's stunning success in the 2019 general election and Boris Johnson's pledge to “get Brexit done”. That month also saw Starmer take over as Labour leader from Jeremy Corbyn.This was also amid a spirit of national unity following the onset of the COVID pandemic which nearly killed Johnson himself. The then-PM had been released from hospital five days before this particular survey was taken.Boris Johnson delivers his final speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street in September 2022. (AFP via Getty Images)Over the rest of the year, there was a downturn in support amid chaos over COVID rules, with the Tories falling as low as 35% in November 2020, compared to Labour on 40%.However, the UK’s successful COVID vaccination programme provided a pathway out of lockdown and with it, improved poll ratings. Tory support peaked at 41% in June 2021, with Labour at 30%.In October that year, there was a sense Johnson was untouchable. At the Tory party conference, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg remarked how the PM was ""in total command of his party, and politically dominant in the country"".But this fell apart quickly with the Partygate scandal, which emerged in November that year. Time and again, reports emerged of government and Tory staff – including Johnson – having taken part in lockdown-era social gatherings when their own COVID rules had prohibited them.By January 2022, Tory support had plummeted to 28%, with Labour on 38%. Johnson struggled on, but never recovered and a wave of ministerial resignations forced him to resign in July that year.The UK had three separate prime ministers – Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak – between 6 September and 24 October, 2022. (Getty Images)His successor, Liz Truss, then embarked on arguably the most disastrous prime ministerial reign in history, characterised by the catastrophic ""mini-budget"", containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, which prompted an economic crisis. Like Johnson, she lost the confidence of Tory MPs – and voters – and had to resign.Her 49-day spell as PM was the shortest in history, with Tory support plummeting to 19% (with Labour on 56%) the day after she announced her resignation in October 2022.Rishi Sunak, who had lost to Truss in the previous month's Tory leadership election, took over. However, as the above YouGov chart indicates, he has failed to cut through with voters. Tory support was at 23% two days after he assumed office, with the most recent survey, carried out on Thursday, showing support is now lower than under Truss at 18%.In short, the polls and odds, not to mention other factors such as notable by-election victories for Starmer's Labour, are pointing to a Labour government next week.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

The Telegraph,Everything you need to know about the betting scandal rocking the general election,"['When did it start?', 'Who is involved?', 'Is anyone else involved?', 'Who is investigating?', 'What is the punishment for using inside information?']",Nick Gutteridge,27 June 2024 at 3:52 pm·4-min read,27,June,2024,03:52:00,4,"Westminster has been rocked by allegations that senior Tories bet on the date of the general election before it was announced by Rishi Sunak.The Gambling Commission, an independent watchdog, has launched an investigation into whether party figures illicitly used insider knowledge.So far five Conservatives have been named as under investigation, as well as one Labour candidate who bet on the result in his own seat.Here The Telegraph walks you through the developing scandal.When did it start?The issue first came to public attention on June 12 when The Guardian reported that Craig Williams had placed a bet on the timing of the election.Mr Williams, who is the Prime Minister’s parliamentary private secretary, admitted having a “flutter” on the fact that the snap poll would be called in July.He reportedly placed a £100 wager on that fact at a bookmaker in his Welsh constituency three days before Mr Sunak announced the election date.The Conservatives have since withdrawn their support for Mr Williams, who will now appear on the ballot paper on July 4 as an independent candidate.Who is involved?It has since emerged that four other Conservatives are being investigated for betting on the election.The Gambling Commission is investigating Tony Lee, the party’s director of campaigning, and Laura Saunders, his wife who was the Tory candidate in Bristol North West.Nick Mason, Craig Williams and Laura Saunders are being investigated - Alice HeppleTony Lee is on 'leave' following the probeLike Mr Williams, the party has since removed its support from Ms Saunders.Nick Mason, its chief data officer, has taken a leave of absence following the Gambling Commission to investigate him.Allegations have also been made against Russell George, a Tory member of the devolved Welsh parliament.Russell George is the fifth Conservative politician to be investigated in connection with betsThree other Conservatives are reported to have bet on the election. But they are not under investigation by the watchdog because they are not accused of using inside information to do so.Alister Jack, the secretary of state for Scotland, has admitted that he placed three bets on the date of the election earlier this year, winning one and losing two.Kevin Hollinrake, the business minister, said on Thursday that he had bet on the Tories winning the election but not on the seat where he is running.Meanwhile, Sir Philip Davies, who is standing for re-election in Shipley, has not denied placing an £8,000 bet that he would lose the seat at the election.Liam Booth-Smith, Rishi Sunak’s chief of staff, has been interviewed as a witness by the Gambling Commission but he is not suspected of placing any bets himself.Is anyone else involved?The Labour Party has also been dragged into the scandal after suspending a candidate who wagered that he would lose his seat.Kevin Craig, who was due to stand for Sir Keir Starmer’s party in Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, said he had planned to give the winnings to local charities.Kevin Craig said he was 'deeply sorry'The Metropolitan Police has also confirmed that the Gambling Commission is looking at five more police officers over election bets after one from Rishi Sunak’s close protection team was arrested.Who is investigating?The Conservatives are conducting an internal investigation into their own candidates.But probes are also being carried out by the Gambling Commission and the Metropolitan Police.Scotland Yard has taken control of a number of criminal investigations into the scandal.The force said on Wednesday that it will take charge of a small number of cases where offences such as misconduct in public office are alleged to have been committed.The Gambling Commission is continuing its own investigations into offences which are alleged to have breached the Gambling Act, under which it is illegal to use inside information to place a bet.Inside information is information which is known by an individual or individuals as a result of their role in connection with an event, and which is not in the public domain.“If someone uses confidential information in order to gain an unfair advantage when betting, this may constitute an offence of cheating under Section 42 of the Gambling Act, which is a criminal offence,” the act says.What is the punishment for using inside information?It is therefore a potential criminal offence to place a bet on something when you already know the outcome thanks to information that is not in the public domain.Those found guilty could face up to two years in prison, a fine, or both.In many cases, the Gambling Commission deems sanctions imposed by a sports governing body or the confiscation of winnings by a betting operator to be proportionate."

Many also assume his title is hereditary.So what do you really need to know about the man who, on current poll ratings, is set to be the UK’s next prime minister?His early lifeKeir Starmer was born in Southwark, south London, in 1962, as the second of four children. His parents were Labour Party members and named him after Keir Hardie, the party’s first leader in parliament.The family moved out of the capital and he grew up in Hurst Green, a village just outside the small Surrey town of Oxted. He was active in youth politics from his teenage years but was also a skilled musician, taking music lessons alongside Norman Cook, who later became better known as a member of The Housemartins and the DJ Fatboy Slim.Starmer played the flute, piano, violin and recorder and was a junior exhibitioner at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.His familyStarmer is married to Victoria, a former solicitor who later retrained in occupational health and now works for the NHS. The pair met through their work in the law in the early 2000s and married in Essex in 2007.She was first seen accompanying her husband when the couple were filmed clapping for carers during the pandemic in 2020 outside their home in Camden. They have two children, a son and daughter, but both are kept out of the public eye.Victoria's father was Jewish and originally came from Poland, while her mother converted when they got married. Starmer has said in a previous interview that ""my wife in particular wants our children to know the faith of her family"" and that they ""observe some of the practices, for example Friday night prayers"".Keir Starmer with parents, Rodney and Josephine, at his graduation. (Twitter/Keir Starmer)His parentsThe Labour leader's father, Rodney Starmer, worked as a toolmaker in a factory, and his mother Josephine Starmer (née Baker), was a nurse.His father worked long, 14-hour days but spent his time outside work caring for Josephine, who was diagnosed with the autoimmune condition Still’s disease. She required two hip and knee replacements twice in her lifetime and struggled with arthritic pain.As a young man Starmer also helped care for his mother, which he has said led to him being more emotionally reserved. His sister, Katy, recalled: “He’s had to be a grown-up all his life. I’ve always been quite open about my feelings – Keir is good at most things, but not that.” Josephine Starmer died in 2015, and his father three years later.His educationStarmer passed the 11-plus examination, and attended Reigate Grammar School from age 11. While he was at the school it became an independent fee-paying institution, but as an existing student he was exempt from fees, and his tuition in the sixth form was covered by a bursary.After school he studied law at the University of Leeds, this first in his family to attend university, graduating with a first class degree in 1985. He undertook postgraduate law studied at the University of Oxford, where he served as editor of a radical magazine, Socialist Alternatives.A photograph of a younger Starmer as shown on ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories in 2021. (ITV)Why is he a sir?Stamer was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 2014 in recognition of his work in the legal profession, culminating in a five-year term as Director of Public Prosecutions.He first became a barrister in 1987 at the Middle Temple, later joining Doughty Street Chambers and was appointed a Queen’s Counsel in 2002, aged just 39. In 2008 he was appointed head of the Crown Prosecution Service and DPP.During his tenure he chose to prosecute three Labour MPs and a Conservative in the wake of the parliamentary expenses scandal, and was responsible for prosecuting former MP Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce for perverting the course of justice after Pryce claimed responsibility for her former husband’s speeding offence.Starmer on... the NHSThe Labour leader has said that, if elected, his government would “get the NHS working around the clock and pay staff properly to do it”.The remark followed a commitment to provide £1.1bn in funding for the health service to cut waiting lists by paying doctors and nurses to carry out additional out-of-hours care, which would be funded by axing tax breaks for wealthy “non-doms” who hoard money overseas. He added: “The Conservative Party that brought our NHS to its knees will put it in the ground. We have to get it back on its feet.”Starmer describes the NHS as “the crowdfunded solution for all of us”, reinforcing his commitment to healthcare being free at the point of use, but says reform is inevitable or the health service would “remain on life support”. He has pledged to integrate up-to-date technology into every part of the NHS including using artificial intelligence to diagnose disease earlier and more accurately.He supported the doctors strikes, telling ministers: “Don’t break junior doctors, talk to them.

Starmer has said a Labour government would set up a new policy unit to tackle illegal migration and has suggested that a returns agreement for asylum seekers could be negotiated with the European Union to solve the small boats crisis.He described the government’s thwarted Rwanda plan, which would see illegal migrants deported to the African nation but has to be put into practice due to legal blocks, as a “gimmick” and a “farce” and has promised to reverse it.Starmer on... the cost of living crisisStarmer has sought to keep Rishi Sunak’s handling of the cost of living crisis in the minds of voters by claiming that “his fingerprints are all over their struggling household budgets”. In a letter to his shadow cabinet, leaked to The Guardian, he wrote: “Rishi Sunak is the chief architect of choices prioritising the wealthiest and of the government’s failure to get a grip of the economy and get growth going.”He has said he would prioritise tackling inflation, blaming it for putting up prices and eroding household savings, but has pledged to “take the difficult and responsible decisions” to bring it down.Starmer pictured in 2010, when he was director of public prosecution at the CPS, making a statement about MPs who face charges over their expenses claims.

The money raised, he said, will be used to address the “appalling state” of the school system for all children.“It’s not an attack on private schools. It’s just saying an exemption you have had is going to go,” he warned private schools who have been critical of the plan – reminding them they are not obliged to pass that tax on to parents in the form of increased fees.Starmer on… the House of LordsWhen he was first Labour leader, Starmer proposed a “root and branch reform of the centre of government… rooting out unearned privilege and addressing unaccountable power”.But his promise to scrap the House of Lords within the first four years of a new parliament - a controversial move that caused a split among his party’s grandees, has been abandoned.Starmer still backs plans for a second chamber “electoral legitimacy”, but as his party nears government he has stepped away from the most radical form of that pledge. He is now reportedly committed to cutting the number of hereditary peers, reducing the size of the chamber and introducing a new appointments process."
Yahoo News UK,Who is Ed Davey? Lib Dem leader attracts attention with election stuntsEverything you need to know about the former minister who has pledged to fight for the NHS.,[],Hannah Fearn,7 June 2024 at 11:47 am·7-min read,7,June,2024,11:47:00,7,"Ed Davey has been involved in a number of comedy stunts since the election was called. (Alamy) With the spotlight on prime minister Rishi Sunak and Labour leader Keir Starmer as they prepare to slug it out in a general election campaign, the focus had started slipping from Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey until a series of stunts put him back in the spotlight.The former coalition government cabinet minister - who lost his seat, punished by voters for getting into bed with the Tories, but then won it back again - is sending a clear message that he should not be overlooked.He’s had a long political career and the climax may still be ahead: if polls continue to shift away from the Conservatives at the current trajectory, there’s a slim possibility that, if the election is held in October, he could end up as Leader of the Opposition.So what do we know about the man behind the third party in British politics? Hannah Fearn finds out.His early lifeEd Davey was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on Christmas Day in 1965. He was the youngest of three boys, but lost his father at just four years old, and his mother followed over a decade later when he was in his mid-teens. She spent three years battling cancer, during which time he nursed his mother together with his grandmother and brother Henry.Once a keen Scout and Air Scout, he later remembers feeling “isolated” at school because of his caring responsibilities, which meant he couldn’t take part in after-school activities or sports. “The last 18 months she was bedridden and in a lot of pain. I’d spend hours on the bed, talking to her,” he said. Davey was with his mother when she died at Nottingham General Hospital, after being placed on an unsuited dementia ward.After both his parents had died, Davey was brought up by his maternal grandparents in the village of Eakring, though his grandfather died soon after. He spent much of his childhood and young adulthood close to his grandmother. “First of all, she was looking after me. Then we were looking after each other,” he said.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

Gasson stood in four elections but failed to win a seat and is now a councillor. The pair have two children, a son and daughter.Their son, born in 2007 and now a teenager, is disabled with a neurological condition. He attended special schools but is now educated at home with a tutor - a change that Davey said led to him becoming verbal for the first time. He has spoken about his anxiety about who will care for his son when he and his wife are no longer around. “It’s the thing that worries me more than anything else in my life,” he said.Gasson was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in 2012. She was well for many years following her diagnosis, but declined during lockdown and is working on recovering her physical strength.Liberal Democrats election broadcast shows Ed Davey with his son. (Liberal Democrats)His parentsHis father, John, was a solicitor and his mother, Nina, a teacher. Davey has described how he was inspired to study by his mother, who always wanted him to try hard academically and who he wanted to impress.His educationDavey attended the private Nottingham High School, the alma mater of former chancellor Kenneth Clarke. He became head boy, with Labour MP Ed Balls - who was studying in the year below - watching on. After school, he achieved a first class degree in philosophy, politics and economics at Jesus College, Oxford where he was junior common room president. After becoming an economics research for the Liberal Democrats he returned to study, reading for a master’s degree in economics at Birkbeck College, London.Ed Davey, pictured with his family. (Liberal Democrats)Why is he a sir?For three years, the Lib Dem leader was a member of the cabinet during the period of Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, holding the post of secretary of state for energy and climate change from 2012 to 2015. He was knighted in the 2016 New Year’s Honours for “political and public services”.Davey on... the cost of living crisisDavey has repeatedly attacked the government for failing to curb rapid inflation and the devastating effect it is having on household budgets. He called the Conservative Party “so out of touch they might as well be living on another planet”, and said he warned Jeremy Hunt “people are desperate for real help… but all the chancellor could offer is empty words and unfair tax hikes”. In particular, he has urged more action on food price inflation, which analysis from his own party found had risen 37 per cent in one year for the average weekly supermarket trip. He has promised to end energy hikes and abandoned his plan to add 1p to income tax to save the NHS because ordinary voters can no longer afford it.Davey on... the NHSThe Liberal Democrats have made the NHS a cornerstone of their policy platform for the last five years. In Davey’s words: “Voting Conservative is bad for your health.” He promises to reverse cuts to GP numbers and guarantee a doctor’s appointment when you need one, improve access to NHS dentistry and save lives by tackling ambulance call out delays. Davey blames the care crisis for deepening the problems of the health service and says his party would spend £5bn a year on a “care package” to ensure patients are discharged from hospital more quickly, freeing up bed space. However, there is little detail on how this would be financed without raising taxes on the wealthiest - which Davey has promised not to do in his push to poach disillusioned Tory voters.British Leader of the Liberal Democrats party Ed Davey arrives at the BBC Broadcasting House, for his appearance on 'Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg', in London, Britain, April 28, 2024. REUTERS/Maja SmiejkowskaDavey on... immigrationThe Lib Dem leader has been a long-standing advocate for refugee rights and critic of the government’s immigration policy. He has called for Conservative plans to deport failed asylum seekers to Rwanda a “cynical distraction” from the partygate crisis and the money would be better spent on measures to tackle the cost of living crisis. He added: “They’ve provided no evidence to suggest that this new policy will stop illegal smuggling, they’re not cracking down on the organised crime gangs, which is what you need to do.” He has called for a new right to work for refugees and asylum seekers, and major reform of the Home Office which he says is no longer up to the job. After the end of the coalition government, Davey has said his party “was wrong” to go along with the introduction of a minimum income standard for immigrants. He later described the policy as “nasty and unfair”.Davey on... the Post Office scandalDespite the Horizon scandal that led to the wrongful prosecution of more than 700 subpostmasters crossing the tenure of more than a dozen business secretaries, Ed Davey has recently taken the heat for failing to investigate the issue while he was in the job.It has emerged that Davey initially rejected a request to meet justice campaigner Alan Bates, and later accepted it only on the advice that it would be good for his PR. He has recently apologised for not acting earlier, admitting that he is sorry that he “did not see through Post Office lies” about the fault in the Horizon programme."
