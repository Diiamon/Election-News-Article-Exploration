Yahoo News UK,"Three important UK election issues, explainedRishi Sunak said his leadership is needed in 'uncertain' times. Keir Starmer said the country needs to be 'rebuilt'. So what issues do voters care about most?","['The economy', 'Health', 'Immigration and asylum']",James Cheng-Morris,Updated 28 May 2024 at 11:11 am·5-min read,28,May,2024,11:11:00,5,"After months of speculation, Rishi Sunak confirmed the general election will be held on 4 July.The prime minister said Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer could not be trusted to lead the country through “uncertain” times. He made the economy and combating global security the key elements of his pitch to the nation as he announced the election date.In response, Starmer told voters: “Together we can stop the chaos, we can turn the page, we can start to rebuild Britain.”But amid this “uncertainty” and need to “rebuild”, what do the voters consider the key issues?This chart, produced using YouGov polling over the course of this parliament, offers an insight in the issues voters care most about and how that has ebbed and flowed over time.Compared to when Boris Johnson's Tories won the December 2019 poll, the economy, immigration, defence and tax have grown in importance in the eyes of the electorate. This has come amid the cost of living crisis; small boats crossing the English Channel; the onset of the Ukraine war and wider global instability; and the highest tax burden in 70 years.Housing has also become a bigger concern, with the Renters Reform Bill - in which the government pledged to scrap no-fault evictions - having been paused after Sunak called the election.Meanwhile, the last general election was fought - and won by the Tories - on a single issue: Brexit. Yet the chart shows a clear downturn in its relevance among voters, particularly after a trade deal was agreed with the EU in December 2020.This next chart, meanwhile, highlights what voters have considered the top issues over the past year. By a wide margin, the top three are the economy, health and immigration and asylum.Here, Yahoo News UK breaks down what is behind these issues and how they have ebbed and flowed in importance among voters since the last election in 2019.The economyThe unprecedented lockdown called by Boris Johnson in March 2020 meant the public’s attention shifted to the economy, as demonstrated by the huge spike in the chart above. The then-chancellor Rishi Sunak was forced to implement a £70bn furlough scheme, lasting 18 months, to protect people’s jobs.There was a second almighty economic shock - and rise in public concern - in February 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This caused a further spike in an already turbulent wholesale energy market, driving up costs for suppliers and ultimately customers.Average energy bills eventually reached £2,500 a year (and would have exceeded £4,000 had the government not intervened). This was double the £1,278 consumers were paying before the war and by the time this election takes place, people will still be paying much more than this: £1,568.Energy prices were also a key driver in inflation reaching 11.1% - a 41-year high - by October 2022, though it has since fallen to 2.3%, which is near the Bank of England’s 2.0% target.The third economic shock of this parliament - and most damaging for the Tories - was in October 2022 when Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng's disastrous “mini budget”, containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, prompted an economic crisis. It led to soaring interest rates, and to this day homeowners who are remortgaging are facing significantly higher bills.HealthHealth, like the economy, is another issue which clearly correlated with the beginning of the pandemic. The above chart shows an enormous spike in public concern when COVID cases started to multiply in March 2020, ultimately leading to the nationwide lockdown as the NHS faced collapse.Cases fell that summer, but spikes in the chart can be seen once infections rose again and fresh nationwide lockdowns were imposed in October 2020 and January 2021. By March 2022, likely as concerns over the Omicron variant faded, there was much less concern about health.In January last year, there was a brief spike as the NHS in England experienced the biggest industrial action in its history, with tens of thousands of nurses and ambulance staff walking out simultaneously.As for the state of play going into the election, NHS waiting lists remain higher than they were when Sunak vowed to cut them last year. According to the latest figures, an estimated 7.54 million treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of March, relating to 6.29 million patients.Immigration and asylumSince the last election, the immigration and asylum narrative has largely revolved around one issue: small boats crossing the English Channel.The numbers have risen in most of the intervening years: there were 1,843 crossings in 2019, 8,466 in 2020, 28,526 in 2021, 45,774 in 2022 and 29,437 last year. This year, the number has already passed the 10,000 mark.The regular sharp spikes in the above chart demonstrate how frequently crossings have been in the news, including some occasions when hundreds of migrants have made the dangerous journey in a single day.But it also reflects how the government has made this part of its own agenda. It was Boris Johnson’s government which first announced plans to deport migrants to Rwanda in April 2022. That policy was picked up by Rishi Sunak when he became prime minister in October that year, with Sunak since repeating his pledge to “stop the boats”.But after calling the election, Sunak admitted this week that flights would not take off before the country goes to the polls.Read moreFive important laws that could be dropped due to Sunak's snap election (Yahoo News UK)OPINION - Rishi Sunak has been in last-ditch campaign mode for so long — a General Election is logical (Evening Standard)Door open for Boris Johnson to campaign for Tories, Rishi Sunak signals (PA Media)"
Yahoo News UK,The Tory ministers and 'big beasts' who could lose MP seats in the electionSeveral big names in the Conservative Party are at risk of losing their seats in the general election.,"['Grant Shapps', 'Penny Mordaunt', 'Liz Truss', 'Jacob Rees-Mogg', 'Johnny Mercer', 'Victoria Prentis', 'Alex Chalk', 'David TC Davies']",Andy Wells,Updated 20 June 2024 at 3:51 am·5-min read,20,June,2024,03:51:00,5,"Rishi Sunak could become the first prime minister to lose his seat in a general election, according to new bombshell polling.According to the Savanta poll, which was commissioned by The Telegraph, the Conservatives are projected to win just 53 seats in the general election. Some three-quarters of the Cabinet would lose their seats in that scenario – including Sunak.Were Sunak to lose his seat in Richmond (Yorks), it would make him the first prime minister in history to lose their seat in a general election, according to the Institute for Government. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is also facing a battle to hold on to his constituency, with the vote on a “knife edge”.Savanta spoke to around 18,000 people between 7 June and 18 June for their poll. If reflected in the election, Labour would be on course to win 516 seats, with a commanding Commons majority of 382. The Liberal Democrats would have nearly as many seats (50) as the Tories.Jeremy Hunt: My constituency is on a knife edgeHunt could be among the Conservative casualties on the night of the 4 July poll, despite his newly-created seat in Godalming and Ash currently holding a Conservative majority of more than 10,000. He is facing a battle to win the seat in Surrey, with the Liberal Democrats keen on taking a high-profile scalp.Several other Tory ‘big beasts’ also face a tight vote to hold onto their seat, according to a major poll by Ipsos.Grant ShappsDefence secretary Grant Shapps may lose his seat in the election. (Getty)Defence secretary Grant Shapps, who had been touted as a potential leader of the Conservatives after the election, is at risk of losing his Welwyn Hatfield seat, according to Ipsos. Their polling suggests a likely Labour victory, with Sir Keir Starmer’s party currently on 48%, compared to 28% for the Conservatives.Shapps won the seat in the 2019 election with a vote share of 52.6%, increasing his majority from the previous election.Penny MordauntPenny Mordaunt’s seat is at risk from Labour. (PA)Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons, is another Tory MP whose name has been mentioned in a future leadership contest – in the event of the Tories losing the election. However, she may not even be an MP after 4 July as her Portsmouth North seat is at risk.Seen as “leaning Labour”, polling suggests Labour are on 42%, compared to the Tories on 34%. She won 61.4% of the vote in the 2019 election.Liz TrussFormer prime minister Liz Truss may not be an MP after the election. (PA)Former prime minister Liz Truss is at risk in her South West Norfolk seat. The seat is seen as a “toss up”, with Truss currently in the lead at 31%. Labour are a sitting at 27% but Reform UK are polling 30%.Allowing for margins of error and another two weeks of campaigning, the seat will be hotly contested between all three parties on 4 July.Jacob Rees-MoggJacob Rees-Mogg is on track to lose his seat at the general election. (PA)While no longer a government minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg losing his North East Somerset and Hanham seat would perhaps be one of the night’s bigger surprises. Rees-Mogg has been an outspoken critic of some of Sunak’s policies and is a regular presenter on GB News.However, the Ipsos poll has the seat, which has been newly-created for the 2024 election, is currently showing a “likely Labour” win, with the party on 47%, compared to 30% for the Conservatives.Johnny MercerPolling suggests Johnny Mercer will lose his seat to Labour at the election. (PA)Veterans’ affairs secretary Johnny Mercer is standing for the Plymouth Moor View seat, having last won the seat in 2019 with an increased vote share of 60.7%. However, a “likely” Labour win is expected, with a projected vote share of 49% on 4 July. The Tories are currently polling at 30% – half of what they won in 2019.Victoria PrentisAttorney general Victoria Prentis is currently facing being replaced by Labour in the election. (PA)A “likely” Labour victory is predicted for Banbury, a seat currently held by attorney general Victoria Prentis. The Tories are polling at 30% in the constituency, compared to 40% for Labour. Prentis is notable for being the first British MP to take a Ukrainian refugee in her house following Russia’s invasion.Alex ChalkThe Libreal Democrats are projected to take over justice secretary Alex Chalk’s seat. (Alamy)Justice secretary Alex Chalk won 48% of the vote in the Cheltenham constituency in the 2019 election. However, the seat is now leaning to being “strong Liberal Democrat”, with Sir Ed Davey’s party polling 60% of the vote. Chalk and the Conservatives are projected to win 26% of the vote, according to Ipsos.David TC DaviesDavid TC Davies is projected to lose his seat in the general election. (PA)Welsh secretary David TC Davies is facing a “likely” Labour victory on 4 July, with the party projected to win 45% of the vote, compared to 30% for the Tories.

The Telegraph,SNP manifesto 2024: John Swinney’s election policies at a glance,"['Independence', 'Tax and spending', 'Health and social care', 'Welfare', 'Defence and foreign affairs', 'European Union', 'Immigration', 'Energy and environment', 'Can you vote for the SNP in England?']",Simon Johnson,2 July 2024 at 2:43 am·9-min read,2,July,2024,02:43:00,9,"The SNP will face its first national election on Thursday since Nicola Sturgeon stood down as SNP leader in March 2023.The Scottish Nationalists won 48 of Scotland’s Westminster seats in the 2019 election but polls suggest they are on course to lose at least half at the general election thanks to a combination of a resurgent Labour Party, the Scottish Government’s unpopularity and a series of scandals, including a long-running police investigation into the party’s finances.John Swinney, who replaced the disastrous Humza Yousaf as SNP leader and First Minister, has attempted to paper over some of the party’s yawning divisions in his manifesto, which he launched at a campaign event in Edinburgh on June 19.However, the party document was thin and amounted to only 32 pages, three of which are completely blank.There was also no breakdown of costs for a litany of what appear to be expensive commitments on welfare and NHS spending.Mr Swinney was not a success in his first stint as SNP leader – between 2000 and 2004 – when he was ousted after overseeing two poor election results. Although a more seasoned politician now, he lacks the popular appeal of Ms Sturgeon.So far in the election campaign, the future of North Sea oil and gas has been a major issue in Scotland, with a succession of SNP figures struggling to give a clear answer on the new drilling.Mr Swinney himself has come under pressure over the SNP’s handling of devolved policy areas, such as education and health.Despite these being run from Holyrood, there is evidence that many Scottish voters are becoming increasingly disillusioned with the state of schools and the health service.Read the latest election pollsFollow The Telegraph’s general election live coverageHere is a look at what the SNP has promised in its 32-page pledge and what this may mean for Mr Swinney’s chances on July 4.IndependenceTax and spendingHealth and social careWelfareDefence and foreign affairsEuropean UnionImmigrationEnergy and environmentJohn Swinney with his party's 2024 manifesto at the SNP launch in Edinburgh on June 19 - Jeff J MitchellIndependence“Deliver independence” in ScotlandBegin immediate negotiations with the UK GovernmentDevolve new powers to HolyroodSupport abolition of House of LordsAs had been promised, independence is emblazoned on “page one, line one” of the party’s manifesto, which states: “Vote SNP for Scotland to become an independent country.”However, while it asserts that the SNP can “deliver independence”, the document sheds very little light on how this could be achieved in practice.The SNP manifesto states that the devolved government in Edinburgh would be “empowered to begin immediate negotiations with the UK Government to give democratic effect to Scotland becoming an independent country” should the SNP win a majority of Scottish seats.Mr Swinney has said his preferred route to independence would be a referendum, though any calls for this would be certainly rejected by the UK Government, whether led by Sir Keir Starmer or Rishi Sunak.Interestingly, the manifesto emphasises what the SNP claims is an existing mandate for independence from the last Holyrood elections, saying it is “more important than ever for the mandate won in 2021 to be respected”.Pressed by journalists, Mr Swinney repeatedly refused to concede that his party would lose its claimed independence mandate should it fail to win a majority of Scottish seats.The manifesto attempts on multiple occasions to link independence to what polls suggest Scottish voters generally consider more pressing issues, such as the economy, NHS and the cost of living.Other constitutional policies include the devolution of a swathe of new powers to Holyrood and to support the abolition of the House of Lords.Tax and spending“Full devolution” of tax powers to HolyroodEndorse windfall taxes on Scottish businessesSupport Labour’s VAT raid on private schoolsThe SNP have hiked income taxes on everyone earning over £28,000 in Scotland, but would like to go further according to its manifesto.The party is demanding the “full devolution” of tax powers to Holyrood so that more cash can be raised.Mr Swinney said the SNP could “ensure rates and thresholds fit our progressive income tax rates” with the devolution of National Insurance.It also appears to be endorsing a series of windfall taxes on Scottish businesses, claiming powers to impose them would “tackle the twin crises of cost of living and climate change while meeting the specific needs of Scotland”.The party has also backed Labour’s proposal to impose VAT on private schools.Find out how Sir Keir Starmer’s manifesto comparesCurrent fiscal rules would be scrapped under the SNP and replaced with a new set of guidelines allowing more investment in public services.However, the lack of cost details means it is hard to say how these promises would be paid for.Health and social careDemand an extra £10bn for Scottish NHSEnd health service privatisationIncrease NHS pay by at least £6bnThe SNP has demanded that the UK Government pumps an extra £10 billion annually into the NHS, claiming this would “address rampant inflationary pressures and improve performance”.In addition, the party wants the UK Government to match the more generous pay deals Holyrood has agreed with NHS workers to prevent strikes, but is now causing it financial difficulties.This would cost a further £6 billion across the UK and result in a total boost to the Scottish Government’s budget of £1.6 billion.The party is also saying it would introduce a “keep the NHS in public hands bill” to protect the health service.Despite being fully devolved, the SNP has begun warning that only a vote for the nationalists will protect the NHS from privatisation.Opponents have seen this as a sign of desperation from the SNP, particularly as waiting times in Scotland have spiralled to record levels and performance is deteriorating.WelfareScrap two child benefit capOffer free food and energy to low-income groupsDemand full compensation for WASPI womenAt his manifesto launch, Mr Swinney repeatedly attacked Labour over its refusal to promise to scrap the two child benefit cap introduced in 2017.The SNP manifesto says the policy has caused “unnecessary suffering” and must go.While the party has not included costs in its manifesto, independent researchers have estimated that scrapping the policy, which limits benefit payments to two children in a household, would cost £3.4 billion per year.The manifesto also appears to include a vague commitment to effectively offering free food and energy for low-income groups.It backs legislation introducing an “essentials guarantee” to ensure “everyone can afford basic necessities like food and utilities”.The SNP is also demanding “full, fast and fair compensation” for WASPI women, who claim they were wrongly disadvantaged over pension changes.John Swinney campaigning with Edinburgh South West candidate Joanna Cherry on June 12 - Jane BarlowDefence and foreign affairsScrap Trident nuclear deterrentRecognise Palestinian stateIncrease international aid budgetRaise minimum military age to 18The SNP’s flagship defence policy is to scrap the Trident nuclear deterrent.It says the money saved from retiring Britain’s nuclear submarines could instead be spent on “conventional defence and public services”.The party also wants the UK to demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and immediately recognise Palestine as a state.The UK’s international aid budget should be increased to 0.7 per cent, according to the SNP, while the minimum age for joining the UK military should be raised to 18.The party does not put forward a policy on what proportion of GDP should be spent on defence, against the NATO target of 2 per cent.European UnionRe-enter the single marketRestore free movement for EU citizensRejoin the EU following as independent stateThe SNP wants to “reverse the damage of Brexit and re-enter the single market restoring free movement for EU citizens”.However, it appears to concede that the UK will not be rejoining the EU, instead emphasising a “vision for an independent Scotland in the EU”.The manifesto states that Brexit has been a “disaster” for Scotland and wiped billions from the Scottish economy.But, there is no detail about how Scotland would meet membership requirements even if Scotland were to achieve independence.Scottish civil servants have estimated that it could take nearly a decade for a Scottish state to gain entry, from the point of leaving the UK, in what would be a lengthy and highly complex process.There is also nothing about how trade barriers would be created with the rest of the UK – by far Scotland’s largest market – or inevitable border checks would be overcome.ImmigrationReturn of free movement from the EUPowers to issue work permits to foreignersIntroduce post-study and family visasMore welcome regime for asylum seekersScotland’s working age population is expected to shrink over the coming decades, creating a demographic timebomb with fewer working people to pay for services for a larger number of elderly pensioners.The SNP favours a much more liberal immigration policy than the UK Government, including the return of free movement from the EU.It also wants Holyrood to have powers to issue work permits to foreigners, based on the distinctive needs of the Scottish economy. New working visas, five-year post-study visas and family visas with much lower barriers than the UK currently uses would be introduced.The SNP has called for a much more welcome regime for asylum seekers and his government has argued that an independent Scotland would allow them to work and claim benefits.Energy and environmentIntroduce climate compatibility assessments on fossil fuelsBring in climate reparationsInvest £28bn in green economyThe 2024 manifesto does not restate the SNP government’s existing position that there should be a “presumption” against new oil and gas developments in the North Sea.However, it does not fully endorse them either, instead saying there should be an “evidence based approach to oil and gas”.Any further extraction of fossil fuels must only go ahead following a “robust climate compatibility assessment”, though there is no detail on what this would entail.The SNP wants Labour to resurrect its abandoned plan to invest at least £28 billion a year in the green economy and Mr Swinney’s party rules out any new nuclear power plants in Scotland.The manifesto endorses the idea of climate reparations and calls for more investment in “loss and damage”.This is where richer countries, who have historically emitted the most greenhouse gases, make payments to developing countries hit by climate change.It demands that “the UK Government must provide a new contribution to the new Loss and Damage Fund which is truly additional to existing commitments”.Can you vote for the SNP in England?The SNP have only ever fielded candidates in Scotland and will not be contesting any seats in England or Wales.Standing candidates outside of Scotland runs counter to the party’s central aim of negotiating another independence referendum."
The Independent,"Farage not as dangerous as Le Pen because he is a one man act, Straw and Rifkind claim",[],David Maddox,2 July 2024 at 2:28 am·3-min read,2,July,2024,02:28:00,3,"Former foreign secretaries Jack Staw and Sir Malcolm Rifkind have dismissed concerns that Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) topping the first round of the French election should be seen as a warning about Nigel Farage and Reform UK.The result in France has shocked Europe and threatened President Emmanuel Macron’s Le Marche centrist party with a major defeat. He is now dependent on a deal with the far left to keep RN out of power.Concerns have also been expressed after the shock result in France over the weekend with a number of people linking it to the rise of Reform in the polls in the UK election taking place on Thursday.Farage has pushed his party to second in some polls (Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved)Mr Farage has previously been pictured with Ms Le Pen, the French far right leader, and suggested he could work with her on issues like immigration. However, he also suggested that she could be a “a disaster” for France.Connections between the two had previously been made because of their shared views on immigration, both expressing criticism of the west over the war in Ukraine and their similar views on the culture war issues.Ms Le Pen is also believed to have looked at Ukip as a means of remodelling her party from its fascist past to a rightwing nationalist one.However, there are differences with Mr Farage taking a much more libertarian view to economic policy in particular.Le Pen’s party has topped the poll in France (REUTERS)And Mr Straw and Sir Malcolm insisted that the differences do not stop there. Neither expect Reform to perform a similar surge as RN because of crucial differences between the parties - not least because they believe Farage is “a one man show”.Sir Malcolm, who was John Major’s foreign secretary between 1995 and 1997, said: “They are not remotely comparable. Le Pen leads a major party, with a clear ideological identity and many years of growing popular support.“Farage has his own opinions and has some popularity as a campaigner. It is by no means clear if he will even win his own seat in Clacton.“His main objective is to damage the Tories by syphoning of votes that will help Labour win more MPs. He may or may not inflict real damage but he remains an individual not a cause.”Meanwhile, Mr Straw, who served as Labour’s foreign secretary from 2001 to 2006, argued that both Le Pen and Farage provided good reasons not to have a proportional representation electoral system.Former foreign secretary Jack Straw (Getty Images)He said: “I follow French politics as closely as I can. The RN did do very well in the first round but if the left alliance (Nouveau Front populaire) does withdraw in constituencies where it has come third, and Macron's Ensemble does likewise my guess is that the left and centre should win more seats together than the RN, but the RN are now plainly established as a very serious force in French politics.“For all sorts of reasons the RN is much better established than is Farage's lot. It's partly the voting system but partly because thanks to Brexit and Johnson's decision to expel many good One Nation Tories from their party in 2019 the far right rump inside the Tory Party is so much larger than it was - and Sunak has lacked the ability to control it.“Also British society is not so riven as is French in my view. But don't forget that the French voting system is ultimately a first-past-the-post system in the final ballot. If either France or the UK had a PR system God knows where we'd be - except in a mess.”"

He did not register the visit until May 5.He also declared four tickets for Arsenal versus Watford on March 6, 2022, two months after the game, and also declared tickets for his staff for the British Kebab Awards once the deadline had passed."

She also had the highest net satisfaction rating of any Cabinet minister among readers of the influential ConservativeHome website in May. She came fourth in the contest to succeed Boris Johnson in July 2022, and has hinted at a potential Tory leadership run after the election. She may be well placed in Westminster, given that Savanta’s bombshell MRP poll for The Telegraph forecast she would be the only “big beast” left standing after polling day.Leader of the House of Commons, Portsmouth NorthPenny Mordaunt came third in the 2022 leadership contest, and boosted her popularity and her name recognition with her prominent ceremonial role at last year’s Coronation. She was the third most popular Cabinet minister among ConservativeHome readers in May. However, if the Savanta projection is correct, she is on track to lose her seat to Labour on July 4.Former Home Secretary, Fareham and WaterloovilleDespite remaining popular with the Tory base, who admired her tough stance on illegal migration, Ms Braverman might struggle to beat Mrs Badenoch for the support of the Right of the party, having made an early exit in the 2022 leadership race. The Savanta poll also suggests she is set to lose her seat to Labour at the general election.Home Secretary, BraintreeHaving served as education secretary, foreign secretary, and now Home Secretary, Mr Cleverly is one of the Cabinet’s more experienced pairs of hands, though he ranked only 14th among ministers in ConservativeHome’s poll in May.  However, the Army Reserve Lieutenant Colonel is yet another Tory heavyweight likely to lose his seat, according to the Savanta survey, threatening to scupper any leadership ambitions he might harbour.Former Home Secretary, WithamTipped as a grassroots favourite, Ms Patel was recently urged by supporters to stand for the Tory leadership if the party is defeated at the election. Friends said she had not ruled out the possibility of standing but was focused on retaining her Witham constituency in Essex, which she is set to lose to Labour, according to the Savanta poll.Former Prime Minister, Member of the House of LordsThe Foreign Secretary, could technically make a dramatic return as Tory leader, given that there is no requirement for the head of the official opposition (or indeed any opposition party) to hold a seat in the House of Commons. However, such a move would be unprecedented in modern times. The former premier may also pay heed to the fact that he had a negative approval rating with ConservativeHome readers in May.Leader of Reform UK, Not currently an MPMr Farage is currently doing his level best to unseat as many Tory (and Labour) MPs as possible, presumably making him rather unpopular with the Conservative base. But some have speculated he could take the reins from Mr Sunak by defecting from inside Westminster, if he succeeds in his eighth bid to become an MP.Former Prime Minister, Not currently an MPCould Mr Johnson be the Tories’ once and future king? He will not be an MP on July 4, having given up his seat in June last year and opted not to run again. But, like Lord Cameron, he could technically lead from outside Westminster.Minister for Northern Ireland, WycombeMr Baker has indicated that he would put his name forward if he retains his seat in Wycombe, where he has a majority of just 4,214, on July 4. He was previously a senior Tory backbencher, chairing the European Research Group (ERG) of Brexiteer MPs twice during the run up to Britain’s formal departure from the European Union on January 31 2020."
Evening Standard,"'Trust me' with your money, Rachel Reeves tells voters across UK as July 4 polling day looms",[],Nicholas Cecil,2 July 2024 at 2:43 am·10-min read,2,July,2024,02:43:00,10,"Rachel Reeves told how she has strived to persuade Britons to “trust me” with their money as polls showed her becoming the nation’s first female Chancellor within days.As millions of voters across the country are making up their mind over who to back on July 4, she gave reassurances over Labour’s plans for taxation and the economy.Speaking exclusively to The Standard, Ms Reeves said: “I remember when Keir appointed me to the job and he said by the time of the next election people have got to be able to trust me with their money.”In a wide-ranging interview, the shadow chancellor:Spoke of how she wants to grow the City hit by Brexit and some companies listing in New York rather than London.Said she has “nothing against expanding airport capacity,” as Heathrow mulls a third runway, but stressed factors such as the environment needed to be considered.Told how the Metropolitan Police “needs to sort itself out” as Labour vows to halve violence against women and girls within a decade if it gets into power.Rejected easing visa restrictions so London’s hospitality sector can recruit enough staff, stressing: “We want to get immigration down not up so I’m not going to make that commitment.”The Tories have thrown the kitchen sink at Labour on tax as they seek to persuade millions of voters not to trust Sir Keir Starmer’s party on the economy.They cite the note left in 2010 by outgoing Treasury Chief Secretary Liam Byrne to his successor: “I’m afraid there is no money.”So can the nation trust Ms Reeves on the economy and that a Labour government would not leave the public finances in such a state as 14 years ago, admittedly as it reeled from the financial crash.“Absolutely,” she responded.“In the three and a bit years that I have been shadow Chancellor the number one thing that I’ve set out to do is to ensure that people can trust me and do feel that they can trust me with their money which is why everything in our manifesto is fully costed and fully funded.”In a swipe at ex-Prime Minister Liz Truss and her Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s “mini budget,” she added: “I said we would introduce a new Charter for Budget Responsibility with tough spending rules, a fiscal lock so that never again can a Prime Minister and Chancellor try to force through a Budget without a forecast.“So, what people can know with me is that as a former Bank of England economist I’m absolutely committed to that fiscal discipline, the tough rules that are needed to get our public spending under control and our public finances back under control too.”Yet the questions on tax keep on coming, so are there any undisclosed Labour plans to hike levies on the banks in the Square Mile?“Obviously, I worked in the City both at the Bank of England and then in the private sector in financial services, I see our financial services in the UK as a huge asset where there is huge potential to bring more jobs, to export more, to grow that part of the economy,” she said.She stressed Labour had set out “limited tax changes,” such as on non-doms, extending the windfall tax, and changes around how bonuses are treated in private equity, before the phone line goes as she heads to the new constituency of Earley and Woodley in Berkshire, not somewhere Labour would have had on its possible wins radar until recently.Sir Keir has said Labour will not raise taxes on “working people” which he later described as “people who earn their living, rely on our services and don’t really have the ability to write a cheque when they get into trouble”.Given this, what reassurances could the shadow Chancellor give to wealthy Londoners over whether taxes could rise on unearned income?“We have set out the tax changes that we need to make,” she replied, reeling of some of the rises already announced, before adding “beyond that there is nothing in our plans that would require further tax changes.”Labour is banking on restoring healthy economic growth to Britain, which has been elusive in the post-Brexit years, so it can invest more than already announced into public services.But what about council tax and whether it is fair that someone living at One Hyde Park pays less per year than someone living in an average home in Barking & Dagenham, London’s poorest borough (£1,946 v £2,002 a year).“I want taxes to come down,” said Ms Reeves.“But the focus of an incoming Labour government is going to be on growing the economy rather than on tinkering around with tax rates because in the end the way to make people better off is to bring wealth and prosperity, and good jobs, to London and across the UK,” said the Lewisham-born shadow Chancellor.She stressed there would be “difficult decisions” including for example on planning.Pressed on a third runway at Heathrow, she said: “We would need to look at all the evidence at that, but I have nothing against expanding airport capacity.“I want heathrow to be that European hub for travel.“We would need to look at all the evidence including around the environment, but you know I back our airports.“I back investing in infrastructure.”Some hospitality chiefs in London are struggling to recruit enough staff and would like to see visa restrictions eased so these posts could be filled by workers from abroad.But Ms Reeves stated: “Look, we want to get immigration down not up so I’m not going to make that commitment.“We want to work with businesses to help them get the skilled staff that they need but immigration is close to a record high.“We need to focus much more on helping people already in this country get back to work.”She added: “We have a lower participation rate in the labour market than before the pandemic.“We need to get those NHS waiting lists down, help people get back to work, make sure that the welfare system is really geared towards getting people back into work, that’s the answer, not just the lever of immigration.”Labour is pledging to recruits hundreds more teachers and police officers for London but many public sector workers are simply unable to afford to live where they work in the capital so what would the party do to solve this dire situation?Ms Reeves turned partly to the Mayor of London, explaining: “Sadiq in his time as Mayor has trebled the amount of affordable housing built, compared to what he inherited from Boris Johnson and we have made a commitment, an incoming Labour government to build 1.5 million in the first term of a Labour government.“We will work with Sadiq and of course with our other mayors, but I recognise the chronic housing problems in London, to ensure that mix including affordable housing in London and including social and council housing in London.“But in the end, we have got to increase the supply of housing if we are going to ensure that people can afford to buy a home of their own or indeed rent a place of their own.”But if public sector workers are not able to live close to where they work, many of them end up paying ever rising train fares.“We have got the biggest reform in a generation of our railways, bringing railways back into public ownership when those contracts come to an end, so that public transport is run for passengers and not for profit, that’s a commitment that we are making if we have the chance to form the next government,” Ms Reeves responded, though her words are unlikely to reassure some commuters.Labour has been accused of being too timid in some policy areas, which is pushing some young voters towards other parties, such as the Greens.Mr Khan has backed rent controls for the capital, so why won’t Labour do so?“In the end the reason prices go up is because there is a mismatch between demand and supply so our focus is on increasing the supply of housing,” said Ms Reeves.The Mayor also took a political risk with the Ultra Low Emission Zone extension to Outer London, so should Labour be bolder on climate change?Ms Reeves, who Labour has claimed would be Britain’s “first green Chancellor”, insisted: “Our Green Prosperity Plan, the creation of both GB Energy, a wholly publicly-owned energy company where the returns go to the taxpayer, as well as the National Wealth Fund to invest alongside businesses in some of the jobs and industries of the future, while also looking to lower people’s bills, they are pretty bold and exciting moves.”But again is Mr Khan being bolder on free school meals for all primary school pupils, a step that Labour has not adopted.“We are committed to free breakfast clubs at all primary schools,” she said.“But I think people understand the inheritance that an incoming Labour government will have if we have the privilege of forming the next government, we are not going to be able to do everything that people might want us to do.“So we are focusing on those free breakfast clubs to ensure that all children get a really good start to the day and also to help mums and dads work more hours by being able to drop their kids off at school a little bit earlier, that will be our priority.“But if we were going to start making more funding commitments, we would have to say where that money is going to come from and I’ve been really clear that everything in our manifesto will be fully costed and fully funded and that means that you have to say no to people who have got perhaps good ideas but you add them up and if you tried to do all these things it would mean higher taxes and I’m not prepared to do that.”Labour’s manifesto lays out a “landmark mission to halve violence against women and girls in a decade”.Asked whether the Met Police should be making tackling violence against women a higher priority, Ms Reeves said: “An incoming Labour government will make it a higher priority.“It’s a real scourge on our society.“I think something like 2.6 per cent of rape cases end up in a prosecution within the same year.“So many people now just don’t even report rape and sexual crimes because they know that they are not going to get justice and that is a terrible state of affairs.”She added: “The Met needs to sort itself out but also needs to make sure that these serious crimes are reported and then the evidence followed through to conviction.”Tories in Chelsea and Fulham, and Kensington and Bayswater, two marginal seats, believe that Labour’s plan for VAT on private school fees, is swinging some voters their way.“The majority of the children in those two constituencies go to state schools,” said Ms Reeves, a claim disputed by some Conservatives.“And our commitment is to reinvest every single penny of that money (from the VAT change) into our state schools,” she added.“I think most people would agree that the real challenges in our education system are those children who are at state schools where they are not being taught by qualified teachers, where there are not enough text books, pens, paper in the classroom, that those are the kids that are missing out on the first-rate education that businesses tell us is absolutely critical for them and their businesses.”"

PM battles to stay in power after election gambleAs the prime minister calls a snap election, here’s everything you need to know about Rishi Sunak and what he’s saying about the biggest issues in British politics","['Early life', ""Sunak's family"", 'His parents', 'His education', 'How much is he worth?', 'His religion', 'Sunak on... the NHS', 'Sunak on… immigration', 'Sunak on... the cost of living crisis', 'Sunak on... pensions']",Hannah Fearn,23 May 2024 at 7:21 am·8-min read,23,May,2024,07:21:00,8,"Rishi Sunak has the fight of his political life ahead of him after calling a snap general election for 4 July. The polls have consistently painted a very bleak picture for the prime minister, with Labour holding on to a double-digit poll lead over his Conservatives.Recent by-election results suggest that Labour is likely to win a landslide victory – but there’s still time for the PM to turn it around.Here’s everything you need to know about Sunak and what’s he’s saying about the biggest issues in British politics right now.Early lifeSunak was born in Southampton in 1980, the eldest of three children. His Indian parents both arrived from East Africa in the 1960s. A football-mad boy whose childhood idol was Matt Le Tissier, Sunak was described by the family’s neighbours as a child with “lovely manners”.In his youngest years, the PM attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. According to a recent biography, fellow pupil Ollie Case said: “He was someone that was talked about. The teachers would say: ‘He’s going to be prime minister'.""But, growing up in the 1980s and 90s, he also remembers experiencing racism. “My mother was obsessed with us not having accents,” Sunak has said.Rishi Sunak was football-mad as a boy growing up in Southampton. (ITV)Sunak's familySunak is married to Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian entrepreneur and multi-billionaire. The pair first met in 2004 at Stanford University, his future wife apparently attracted to his “honesty and integrity”.Five years later they married in a two-day Indian wedding held in Bangalore. The couple have two daughters, Krishna and Anoushka, who will turn 13 and 11 this year, both of whom are largely kept out of the public eye.Sunak attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. (Rishi Sunak, Instagram)His parentsYashvir Sunak, Rishi’s father, was born in Kenya. He arrived in the UK to study medicine and then stayed, becoming an NHS GP. His mother, Usha, was born in Tanzania and is a pharmacist.The couple met in Britain and settled in Southampton in the 1970s. Usha is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.His educationAs a teenager Sunak studied at Winchester College where he was, he says, a self-confessed “geek”. According to a recent biography, the “naughtiest” thing the prime minister did during his school days “was to smuggle a hand-held television into the school so that he did not miss any key games of Euro 96”.The childhood home of Rishi Sunak in Southampton. (Getty Images, photo taken in 2022)Perhaps unsurprisingly for someone with such an unblemished record, he went on to become the school’s head boy. Sunak worked while studying, delivering medicines for his mother’s pharmacy and as a waiter at a local Indian restaurant.After school, Sunk read philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, graduating in 2001 with a first class degree. While still at university he held an internship at the Conservative Party campaign headquarters and joined the party, but went on studying before entering politics.He earned his MBA from Stanford in 2006 as a Fulbright Scholar, meaning he was selected among the most promising candidates from the UK.How much is he worth?As prime minister, Rishi Sunak earns £80,807 on top of a salary of £84,144 for being an MP. But his current income from Westminster pales in comparison to his family’s vast wealth through marriage.The Sunday Times valued the couple’s joint fortune at £730m. Murty's father is the co-founder of Infosys, an Indian tech conglomerate, in which she holds shares estimated at around £430m. Her family is also involved in a £900m business arrangement with Amazon in India, and she is a shareholder of multiple other companies.Rishi Sunak's mother is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.Before entering politics Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and a series of hedge funds. He is also known to have invested in blind trusts, in which investments are made without holders knowing where the funds are located. These arrangements reportedly hold Sunak’s own multi-million-pound fortune.His religionSunak is not only the first prime minister of colour and of Indian heritage but he is also the first practising Hindu to hold the biggest job in UK politics.He has spoken of his pride in his Hindu faith, saying, “that’s how I was raised, and that’s how I am”. He said: “Having faith gives you resilience, gives you strength that is important and it provides an outlook on life which I find particularly valuable.”Sunak on... the NHSThe prime minister’s biggest challenge in office has been the crisis in the NHS - and to many people in the sector his government has been found wanting. “We have not made enough progress,” Sunak said when asked about his commitment to cut NHS waiting lists during an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV. Asked if that meant he had failed, the prime minister replied: “Yes, we have.""Sunak expects to see waiting lists start to reduce this spring, and blames the delays on “industrial action”, as disputes with junior doctors and consultants over pay and conditions continue. Yet Sunak himself has been blamed for holding up a deal that would prevent more walkouts.Sunak, his wife Akshata and daughters Anoushka and Krishna (second left) at Santa Monica Pier, California, on their summer holiday in 2023. (AP)Sunak on… immigrationAccording to the prime minister, illegal migration threatens to “overwhelm” Europe. In June 2023 he claimed his plan to “stop the boats” and tackle illegal immigration was working, but by August 2023 he had changed his mind: “It’s not an easy problem to fix,” he told broadcasters. “I never said we would be able to solve it overnight.”He has staked much of his reputation on the government's Rwanda Bill - his plan to deport asylum seekers to the east African country that finally became law last month, after months of legal and procedural challenges. It has paved the way for deportation flights to get off the ground within weeks.He described his policy, which he says will act as a deterrent to people traffickers, as being “the will of the people” – yet polling suggests low support for such a punitive approach.The policy, coupled with Conservative talk of limits on legal migration, shows that the government is committed to taking a hard line on the issue, despite the risk of alienating more moderate voters.The Rwanda policy is not universally popular. (YouGov)Sunak on... the cost of living crisisThe prime minister has told hard-pressed working families that they will feel some relief from the cost of living crisis as inflation continues to drop following its highs of October 2022. He described the government’s tax cuts as “meaningful” and has welcomed the dip in mortgage rates at the turn of the year.Sunak says falling inflation will have the biggest impact on family budgets “and will start to ease some of those pressures” and that he was right to focus on that figure. However, the global drop in energy prices is probably the biggest factor in easing the hit on wallets - something that the prime minister has no control over.However, the fall in inflation to 2.3% on 22 May this year – the lowest it has been in nearly three years – was likely one of the key factors in persuading Sunak to call a snap election many weeks earlier than experts had predicted.Can we expect more handouts or tax breaks to help balance family budgets? Not according to Sunak, who has warned voters that it’s time to “move on” from government support.Sunak on... pensionsThe triple-lock pensions policy is a tricky one for Sunak – especially since Labour has committed to retaining the policy. Any change to a policy that has become a hallmark of recent Conservative governments would not go down well with the 12 million pensioners it would likely impact – many of whom are lifelong Tory voters.Last November, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said pensions should start being pegged to an average of inflation and wage growth, which would help reduce state spending over time.Sunak’s response to that was ambiguous to say the least: “We are the government that has … delivered the triple lock and it is why, right now, pensions are, depending on how you look at it, £800 or £900 bigger than they otherwise would have been.” He is yet to confirm whether it will appear in the manifesto."

The term is also sometimes used to refer to the election itself, as in ‘they could not win at the ballot box’.CampaignThe time before an election in which politicians persuade people to vote for them. In the case of the 2024 election in the UK, parliament was dissolved on the 30 May and the election will take place on 4 July.CanvassingGoing round a particular area trying to persuade people to vote for one party or the other.In UK elections, this is often done by volunteers knocking on people’s doors.Capital gains taxCapital gains tax is a tax on profit when people sell assets that have increased in value.In the 2024 election, the Conservatives have promised that landlords who sell to sitting tenants will be spared capital gains tax on the proceeds, while Labour has left the door open to raising capital gains.Child benefitChild benefit is a benefit paid to parents with children under 16 (or under 20 in approved education or training).The Conservatives have promised to increase the threshold at which high earners start to lose the benefit from £60,000 to £120,000.Sir Keir Starmer, like the Conservatives, has pledged not to raise VAT. (Photo by Stefan Rousseau/PA Images via Getty Images)CoalitionA coalition government is a government formed jointly by more than one political party (for example, by the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives in 2010).ConstituencyThe geographical area that is represented by each MP in the House of Commons.ECHRThe European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is an international convention which protects human rights in Europe.The Conservative manifesto stopped short of promising to withdraw from the ECHR, which would have made plans such as the plan to deport migrants to Rwanda easier.Exit pollA poll conducted outside polling stations just after people have voted on election day.On election day, the results of Britain’s exit poll are published just after polls close at 10pm and tend to give a more accurate prediction of the result than previous polls produced throughout the campaign.First past the postThe first past the post system is used to elect MPs to the House of Commons.The candidate with the most votes in each constituency becomes MP, and the party with the most MPs becomes the government.This can mean that the winning party actually has a minority of votes cast: in 2019, the Conservatives had 43.6% of the vote.Hung parliamentA hung parliament is where no party has enough seats to form an overall majority. For example, both the 2010 election and 2017 elections resulted in hung parliament.In 2010, the Conservatives formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, while in 2017, the Conservatives formed a minority government with a 'confidence and supply' agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).Income tax thresholdThe thresholds between the tax-free allowance, basic rate tax and higher rates of tax.Both parties have said they will continue the freeze on income tax thresholds brought in under the Conservatives, which means people pay more tax as more and more people are pushed into higher tax brackets if wages rise.MajorityA party with a majority – more than half of the seats in the House of Commons – has won the election.The number of votes by which an individual MP wins a constituency is also referred to as their majority.ManifestoPolitical parties publish manifestos before a general election, with a set of policies that the party stands for and aims to implement if elected.Manifesto pledges are not legally binding.Marginal seatA seat in which the incumbent MP won by a small majority, meaning a swing is more likely than in a so-called ‘safe seat’ where the MP had a large majority.Net zeroThe UK Government has set a goal for Britain’s emissions to reach net zero – where emission and removal of greenhouse gases reaches equilibrium – by 2050.All major parties are expected to stick to this goal, barring Reform UK.Opinion pollAn opinion poll is a research survey (usually carried out on a representative sample of the electorate) to gauge likely results in an election.Poll‘The polls’ refers to the places where people vote in an election: exit polls and opinion polls refer to two kinds of survey used to predict election results.Postal voteAn absentee vote where the vote is sent in by post.At the 2019 general election, 17.2% of voters across the UK used a postal ballot.Proxy voteA vote where a person who can’t make it to the booth appoints someone to vote for them.In the 2019 election, 0.6% of voters appointed a proxy.PsephologyPsephology is the scientific study of elections and voting and is used to predict and analyse election results.Polling dayThe day when the country places their vote: in the UK 2024 election, this is July 4.PurdahBefore British elections, the country enters purdah, officially known as the ‘pre-election period of sensitivity’.Purdah means that politicians (both local and national) and other people such as civil servants face restrictions on what they can do and announce.Ministers who remain in office can’t announce new funding, or new policies, or anything which might sway voters or make the government more popular.The idea is that public money cannot be spent on the election.Spoiled ballotA ballot paper which has been marked wrongly (for instance with a vote for more than one candidate) will not be counted.Sometimes people spoil ballots deliberately as a protest vote to show dissatisfactionSwing‘Swing’ is the change in voter support for a political party between one election and the next.It is used to analyse the performance of parties in different areas.Tax burdenThe tax burden refers to the total amount of taxes paid by a group (in this case the UK as a whole) as a proportion of total income.The tax burden is currently at its highest in 70 years according to the OECD.The Equality ActThe 2010 Equality Act protects people against discrimination in Britain.The Conservatives want to ‘tweak’ the Act so that sex-based protections only apply on the basis of someone’s biological sex.Triple lockThe triple lock is a guarantee introduced to the state pension in 2010 so it would not lose value in real terms.The guarantee means that the state pension will rise by the highest out of average earnings, inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) or 2.5%.Triple lock plusThe ‘triple lock plus’ is a Conservative policy, which would see the tax-free pension allowance rise every year in line with the triple lock of average wages, inflation, or 2.5% – whichever is highest, to prevent pensioners being pulled into paying income tax.TurnoutTurnout refers to the percentage of people eligible to vote who turn out to vote on election day.In the 2019 election, for example, 67.3% of those eligible turned out to vote.VATValue added tax is added to goods and services sold by VAT-registered companies, and is the third-largest source of government income after income tax and national insurance.Both Labour and the Conservatives have pledged not to raise VAT.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

The Lib Dem leader whose life has been marked by adversity,"['His early life', 'His family', 'His parents', 'His education', 'Why is he a Sir?']",Hannah Fearn,Updated 1 July 2024 at 2:04 pm·3-min read,1,July,2024,02:04:00,3,"The youngest of three boys, Sir Ed Davey had a childhood marked by adversity. His mother died when he was a teenager and his father died when he was just four.As an adult, Davey now cares for his son, who is disabled with a neurological condition.So what do we know about the man who leads the third party in British politics?His early lifeEd Davey was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on Christmas Day in 1965. He was the youngest of three boys, but lost his father at just four years old and then his mother when he was in his mid-teens. She had spent three years battling cancer, during which time he nursed his mother together with his grandmother and brother Henry.Once a keen Scout and Air Scout, he later remembers feeling “isolated” at school because of his caring responsibilities, which meant he couldn’t take part in after-school activities or sports. “The last 18 months she was bedridden and in a lot of pain. I’d spend hours on the bed, talking to her,” he said. Davey was with his mother when she died at Nottingham General Hospital, after being placed on an unsuited dementia ward.After both his parents had died, Davey was brought up by his maternal grandparents in the village of Eakring, though his grandfather died soon after. He spent much of his childhood and young adulthood close to his grandmother. “First of all, she was looking after me. Then we were looking after each other,” he said.His familyDavey married Emily Gasson, a former Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate who unsuccessfully stood in four elections and is now a councillor, in 2005 and the pair have two children, a son and daughter.Their son, John, born in 2007 and now a teenager, is disabled with a neurological condition. He has attended special schools but is now educated at home with a tutor – a change that Davey said led to him becoming verbal for the first time. He has spoken about his anxiety about who will care for his son when he and his wife are no longer around. “It’s the thing that worries me more than anything else in my life,” Davey said.Gasson was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in 2012. She was well for many years following her diagnosis, but declined during lockdown and is working on recovering her physical strength.His parentsEd Davey, pictured with his family.

Yahoo News UK,"Who is Richard Tice? Reform’s former leader turned Farage sidekickThe candidate for Hartlepool has seen his party's popularity swell in recent months, with one poll showing reform ahead of the Conservatives.",[],Andrew Naughtie,Updated 14 June 2024 at 6:45 am·6-min read,14,June,2024,06:45:00,6,"Now that Nigel Farage has taken over as the leader of Reform UK, Richard Tice’s public profile is fading fast - but the Reform chairman remains involved in the party's operations.So far, the party has only one MP, Conservative defector Lee Anderson. But a recent poll has shown Reform overtaking the Tories, raising the possibility Anderson could hold his seat and even end up with fellow Reformers in the next Parliament.As the candidate for Hartlepool, where he stood as the Brexit Party candidate in 2019, Tice hopes to be one of them. So who is he, and what does he stand for?Childhood and educationBorn in Surrey in 1964 to James Tice, a showjumper, and Joan Tice, a horse trainer. Educated at the private boarding school Uppingham, he studied at the University of Salford, gaining a degree in construction economics and quantity surveying – teeing him up for a career that he said would ""continue the family genes in the property industry"".Family (partner & kids)Tice has three children from a 24-year marriage that ended in divorce. He is now in a long-term relationship with the right-wing writer and journalist Isabel Oakeshott.She is perhaps best known for two notorious incidents that set her against leading Tories: a book that featured the heavily disputed allegation that David Cameron had engaged in sexual activity with a pig, and the release of embarrassing messages entrusted to her by Matt Hancock when she agreed to write a book with him.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election? Full list mappedThe key issues that will decide the electionWhen is the first UK general election TV debate?What is purdah? The strict rule that governs what politicians can and can't sayNet worthWhile not quite in the same league as Rishi Sunak, Tice is one of the wealthiest people in British politics. As he describes it on his website, he made his multi-million-pound fortune over the course of “30 years of making things happen in property investment”, starting with a graduate job at a London firm in 1987.According to Tice, the company he leads as CEO, Quidnet Capital, has “bought and managed £500 million in commercial properties across the UK on behalf of clients”.He was also a key figure in the redevelopment of London’s Nine Elms district, near Battersea Power Station, a controversial project that has transformed a stretch of the Thames’s south bank with a welter of rapidly erected high-rise blocks.GB News linksAlong with Nigel Farage, Lee Anderson and several MPs on the right flank of the Tory party, Tice is a regular on the hard-right, culture war-focused TV outlet GB News. There he hosts a programme called “Richard Tice’s Sunday Sermon”, which serves as a platform for him to deliver his political analysis without the interruptions of an interviewer.However, despite the network being a relatively safe space for him in ideological terms, Tice’s appearances aren’t always amicable. A recent interview with host Andrew Pierce, a longtime right-wing commentator, saw him challenged fiercely about Reform’s chances in a summer election should one be called – with Pierce pointing to the “weirdos” selected by the party to fight numerous seats as evidence the party is “not ready”.Richard Tice, pictured in 2018 at a 'Leave Means Leave' campaign event, is focused on the issue of immigration. (Steve Finn/WENN)Tice was also involved in an incident that saw the network deemed in breach of broadcasting regulator Ofcom’s impartiality regulations, specifically an interview in which a former Brexit Party MEP failed to “sufficiently challenge” his views on immigration.The regulator is under increasing pressure to crack down on GB News heading into the election, with critics arguing it cannot be allowed to broadcast shows that feature Tory and Reform MPs interviewing each other without alternative points of view represented.Tice on NHSThe state and future of the NHS set to be one of this election’s main battlegrounds, and Reform’s key health policy is to spend £17 billion on the NHS on top of its current budget in an effort to get waiting lists down to zero. It also proposes introducing tax relief on private healthcare – something that has been criticised by opponents as a creeping step towards the privatisation of healthcare writ large.Tice’s stated rationale is that the reason the service is struggling is because the money it needs is being spent on other things that the public do not in fact support. Top of the list is Net Zero, which the party and its predecessors have long decried as a pointless “woke” project.In April, Tice used a press conference to frame the choice starkly. “We have a choice in this country, it seems to me,” he said. “A pretty clear choice. Do we want zero waiting lists in two years, and to keep them there? That is the Reform choice. Or do we want net zero CO2 emissions in 25 years? That is the Labour choice.”Tice on immigrationImmigration is by far Reform UK’s top issue, with the party looking to build on Farage’s two decades of campaigning against it in its legal and illegal forms.As far as the election goes, Tice and the party are targeting the continuing arrival of small boats of people travelling across the English Channel, many of them seeking asylum. He has criticised the government for failing to stop “mass immigration” post-Brexit, and described Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda policy as “a disaster”, arguing on GB News that its supposed deterrent value was revealed to be zero just hours after the House of Commons finally passed the law.Reform chairman Richard Tice (L) and leader Nigel Farage speak at the party's economic policy launch at Church House in London. (Alamy Live News)“Within a matter of hours more boats, absolutely packed full, overfilled with illegal migrants, were setting off from the beaches. And we learnt on Tuesday morning that sadly five people, including a young child, drowned leaving the beaches. That's not a deterrent. That's an absolute disaster.”Instead of deporting people to Rwanda, he is arguing for a “pick up and take back” policy that would see small boat arrivals deposited back on French soil. As evidence that this is both practical and humane, he has cited similar policies deployed in the US and Australia.However, he has not addressed the fact that Australia’s policy has been criticised internationally for leaving so-called “boat people” confined to facilities on the island of Nauru, where there have been incidents of suicide and self-immolation.Tice on cost of living crisisPerhaps unsurprisingly given he is trying to peel away former Tory voters, Tice has criticised recent Tory prime ministers harshly for overseeing Britain’s intense cost of living crisis. In 2022, he accused then-prime minister Boris Johnson of “waffling” over the situation. “Clueless, out of touch, no ideas, no help,” he tweeted. “Shocking.”He has also warned that the prospect of a “disastrous” Labour government will offer no prospect of meaningful relief for struggling households.Instead, Reform proposes lifting the minimum level of income tax to £20,000 while cutting various other taxes – among them fuel duty, another gesture to the party’s rejection of environmentalism as a top priority."

The postal vote system could benefit from review and more could be done to support Royal Mail and printers to be ready to deliver elections.""The deadline to register to vote by post was 19 June, with ballots normally arriving around a week before polling day.Postal votes have to arrive by 10pm on polling day."

I am optimistic because they have indicated a willingness to move on pay.”He added: “I spoke to the BMA the other week ahead of this round of strike action, I asked them to call this round of strike action off and made the case to them as to why they should consider doing that, obviously they went ahead anyway.“They know not just through that discussion, that particular discussion, but through discussions we’ve had privately through what we’ve said consistently publicly, that the 35% pay demand that they’re making is not one that we will be able to afford if we’re in government on Friday, that we’re willing to negotiate on pay, and we’re willing to negotiate on the wider range of conditions that junior doctors are suffering under and I use the term suffering deliberately because I’m pretty appalled at the way junior doctors are treated in terms of placements, rotations and so on.”Junior doctors in England have been on strike for five days (Jordan Pettitt/PA) (PA Wire)PM denies he got Conservative campaign wrong09:01 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak has denied claims he got the Conservative Party’s general election campaign wrong.He told BBC Breakfast: “No. Actually, everywhere I have been going people are waking up to the dangers of what a Labour government would mean for them particularly when it comes to taxes.”Asked about the reason the polls had not changed since the start of the campaign, he said: “My job is to focus on the substance.“It is to explain to people that if I am fortunate enough to continue as their Prime Minister, what will I do for them?

The party that turned Number 10 into a giant lockdown party now wants to lecture others on their work ethic.“It’s a disgrace and the stench of their lies and hypocrisy is even more overwhelming than the vomit they left for Downing Street cleaners, and like those cleaners we’ll clean up the Tories’ mess too if we’re given the chance on Thursday, and as far as I’m concerned, given their behaviour this morning, that change can’t come soon enough.” (Virgin Radio)Coutinho: Party just 130,000 voters away from preventing Labour landslide08:33 , Salma OuaguiraEnergy Secretary Claire Coutinho has echoed Rishi Sunak’s claim that just 130,000 voters could prevent a Labour landslide.She told LBC Radio: “It’s never over till it’s over. What I would say is that lots of people, if they look at the press, they might think the election is a foregone conclusion.“Actually, it’s a relatively small amount of voters across the country – about 130,000 people have been estimated – who can make the difference in this election.”Asked by presenter Nick Ferrari whether those voters could bring about a Tory victory, she said: “There’s quite a lot of seats that are very, very marginal, Nick.

These are the values we believe in.”IFS director Paul Johnson previously said both the Conservatives and Labour are engaged in a “conspiracy of silence” about public spending after the election.The think tank head said the prospective cuts are required to ensure the Government meets its fiscal rule to have debt falling in five years’ time, and involve cutting spending on unprotected departments – including courts, prisons and local councils – by around £20 billion, and cutting public investment by £18 billion a year in real terms.SNP’s Stephen Flynn speaking to BBC Breakfast (BBC)University chancellor says she is an ‘accidental trailblazer’ for women in Stem07:20 , Salma OuaguiraUniversity chancellor says she is an ‘accidental trailblazer’ for women in StemLitvinenko’s widow ‘disgusted’ by Farage praise for Putin07:00 , Salma OuaguiraLitvinenko’s widow ‘disgusted’ by Farage and Reform UK candidate’s praise for PutinInside the constituencies thrown into disarray by the betting scandal05:00 , Salma OuaguiraInside the constituency races thrown into disarray by the betting scandalhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ap-england-boris-johnson-hartlepool-nigel-farage-b2571622.html04:00 , Salma OuaguiraPhillipson blames private schools for ‘pricing out’ middle classes in VAT on fees rowGreens promise to abolish Ofsted03:00 , Barney DavisThe Green Party has pledged to abolish Ofsted and bring in continuous assessments to replace SATs testing, as part of an £8 billion education package.The party is also proposing to scrap tuition fees, provide free school meals for all children, and have a qualified counsellor in every school and college.Co-leader Carla Denyer said the Greens are providing an “A-star offering” which is “fully inclusive and costed”.She said: “To help relieve the stresses in our education system and improve wellbeing, for both teachers and pupils, Greens want to replace high-stakes formal SATs testing in primary and secondary schools with a system of continuous assessment, and abolish Ofsted.“We also want to see a massive boost in funding for special needs provision in mainstream schools, and for a qualified counsellor in every state school and college.“No child must be left behind by poverty.

They’re not mutually exclusive.“And some of the agreements we’ve got with France are bilateral in any event. I think they need to be stronger and better and deeper, particularly in relation to smashing the gangs that are running the vile trade of putting people into boats.“But there are also EU measures. The security agreement we want with the EU when it comes to dealing with smuggling gangs is really important.”Asked whether he was concerned a Eurosceptic French government could make his aim of closer economic ties more difficult to achieve, he said: “I genuinely don’t want to get ahead of myself. Firstly, we haven’t seen the final outcome in France. We’ve also got a big outcome of our own on Thursday.“I don’t think it affects the overall intention we have, which is to negotiate a better deal with the EU. I think the deal we’ve got is botched. I think that anybody who’s trading with the EU feels that it’s botched, and we can do better than that across not just trade, but actually research and development, also on the security front.” (AP)Watch: James Cleverly criticises Banksy migrant boat stunt at GlastonburyMonday 1 July 2024 22:30 , Salma OuaguiraCleverly says Banksy’s Glastonbury migrant boat was ‘celebration of loss of life’Exclusive: Next prime minister urged to dump Sunak’s post-Brexit wine taxMonday 1 July 2024 22:00 , Salma OuaguiraSir Keir Starmer is being urged to dump Rishi Sunak’s ‘sneaky’ post-Brexit wine tax if he wins the keys to Downing Street this week, Kate Devlin reports.Britain’s wine drinkers face a little-known ‘sauvignon surcharge’ from February, as part of changes brought in after the UK left the European Union.As the prime minister uses the election campaign to repeatedly accuse Labour of planning secret tax rises if they get into power, experts and industry leaders today call for his booze levy to be dropped. ‘Sauvignon surcharge’: Next prime minister urged to dump Sunak post-Brexit wine taxWatch: Ed Davey bungee jumps in latest election campaign stuntMonday 1 July 2024 21:30 , Salma OuaguiraEd Davey bungee jumps as Lib Dems kick off last week of general election campaignUK's landmark postwar elections: When Blair won the first of his 3 elections in 1997Monday 1 July 2024 21:00 , Salma OuaguiraUK's landmark postwar elections: When Blair won the first of his 3 elections in 1997‘Putting up taxes is in Labour’s DNA’ - SunakMonday 1 July 2024 20:54 , Barney DavisRishi Sunak claimed urged voters to work over the next three days to prevent the “danger” of a Labour government.Speaking at a campaign event in Leicestershire, the Prime Minister said: “Friends, we have got urgent work to do.

Forecasts suggest he could even make history with the largest ever Labour majority in parliament – winning by even more than Tony Blair achieved with his 1997 landslide.“Yet the event had an air of deliberate caution, tempered by fears of comparisons with 1992 and that the feeling a Labour government is already guaranteed will see the party leak votes to the Lib Dems and the Greens.”Read more here.Civil servants to spend three days each week in the office under a Labour governmentMonday 1 July 2024 17:55 , Barney DavisJonathan Ashworth was asked at a press conference if he would, as paymaster general, remove the requirement brought in by the Tories for civil servants to spend three days a week or 60% of their time in the office.He said it was “sensible that civil servants are in the office and at their desks.”Mr Ashworth said that if elected, a Labour government would get started with their plans that include growing the economy, recruiting more teachers and fixing the NHS.“And I’m confident that the impartial Civil Service, and we are very fortunate this country to have an impartial Civil Service, will want to turn their mind to that agenda as well,” he said.Asked to confirm that he had no plans to change the requirement, he said: “We want to see civil servants in the office, yes.”Conservatives label Sir Keir Starmer ‘Sir Sleepy’ after his refusal to work past 6pm on FridaysMonday 1 July 2024 17:47 , Barney DavisSir Keir Starmer has been mocked by the Tories after saying he wanted to protect his personal time to spend with his son and daughter.The Labour leader and his wife Victoria have a 16-year-old son and a 13-year-old daughter.He told Virgin Radio: “We’ve had a strategy in place and we’ll try to keep to it, which is to carve out really protected time for the kids, so on a Friday – I’ve been doing this for years – I will not do a work-related thing after six o’clock, pretty well come what may.“There are a few exceptions, but that’s what we do.”But Rishi Sunak took a swipe at the Labour leader, telling reporters: “I haven’t finished at six ever.”A Conservative source told The Sun: “Whether he likes it or not, if he became PM, Sir Sleepy would be required to work after 6pm. If he thinks he can just put his slippers on and make a mug of Horlicks while he tunes into The One Show, then he is in for a shock.”Rishi Sunak says he has swapped notes on handling criticism with Gareth Southgate.Monday 1 July 2024 17:40 , Barney DavisThe Prime Minister told the BBC he had spoken to the England manager when it was announced the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland will co-host the Euro 2028 football tournament.“His and I are the jobs everyone thinks they could probably do it better, and has a view.“But look, you know, I think when it comes to those things, and the criticism, which of course is par for the course, you know, it’s easy to deal with when you have a conviction in what you believe – and I do.“And I appreciate that not everyone will agree with me, but I’m clear about what I want to do for our country.”Asked whether he could move the electoral dial against the odds, in the same way Jude Bellingham rescued England’s Euro 2024 match against Slovakia on Sunday with a stoppage-time overhead kick, Mr Sunak instead made a cricket analogy.He said: “Mine is probably more a kind of flashy, cover drive or off drive, or something instead, but there we go.“Look, it is not over till it’s over.”It’s not over until it’s over. pic.twitter.com/FpZe6VMhDa— Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak) June 30, 2024Sunak vows to take responsibility for election resultMonday 1 July 2024 17:40 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak has promised to take personal responsibility for the result of Thursday’s general election.Despite the polls predicting a huge majority for Labour, the prime minister has vowed to own it.Asked on Times Radio if he would, the Mr Sunak replied: “Of course I do, and this election is not over.“There’s a clear choice for everybody in a few days’ time.

Yahoo News UK,"3 electoral maps that show how disastrous the election could be for the ToriesWith new modelling predicting a Labour victory even bigger than Tony Blair's 1997 landslide, the outlook for Rishi Sunak is not looking good.",['Which Tory ministers are at risk of losing their seats?'],James Cheng-Morris and  James Hockaday,Updated 5 June 2024 at 8:34 am·4-min read,5,June,2024,08:34:00,4,"The outlook was already looking bleak for the Conservative Party when Rishi Sunak called the general election following months of dismal approval ratings that showed little sign of improving.At a campaign event last week, Sunak said he didn't think defeat to Labour was a ""foregone conclusion"", suggesting his main election rival Sir Keir Starmer was taking the British electorate ""for granted"".However, a general election projection released on Monday will have added to the Tories' woes – predicting the biggest win for Labour in the party's history, surpassing even that of Tony Blair's 1997 landslide.The analysis, carried out by YouGov for Sky News, used a relatively new polling technique called Multi-level Regression and Post-stratification (MRP), which is regarded to have had a good track record and can provide detailed predictions at a constituency level basis. The scale of Sunak's problems is demonstrated by the interactive maps below, showing just how much ground the Tories are expected to lose compared to their 2019 victory.Click on the arrows in the top left to switch between the two maps. Check your own constituency to see if it is projected to change handsThe first map above shows the seats won in the 2019 general election, when Boris Johnson led the party to a stunning majority.The wall of Tory blue on the map, compared to the spots of Labour red, is a demonstration of just how far Labour, then led by Jeremy Corbyn, had fallen in public standing. The result was Labour's worst electoral performance since 1935.If you toggle to the second map, the projection by YouGov (which was based on polling carried out between 24 May - 1 June) suggests that Starmer's party is on track to win 422 seats, with the Tories down to just 140.Such a result would be the Conservative Party's worst performance at a general election since 1906. If YouGov's predictions are accurate, Labour winning a 194-seat majority would be the highest number since Conservative Stanley Baldwin won a majority of 208 in 1924.The model suggests the Conservatives could be set for near wipeout across many areas of the country, including London, the North East, the North West, and Wales.It also projects that the Scottish National Party would lose more than half their seats, with Labour returning as the largest party north of the border, and the Liberal Democrats reclaiming its place as the third party of British politics – winning 48 seats.The new figures, released yesterday, came as Reform UK co-founder Nigel Farage announced that he would be returning as the populist party's leader and would stand for election in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. Even before Farage's latest bid, pollsters told Yahoo News that Reform UK could pose a serious threat to the Tories by splitting the vote and potentially handing even more seats to Labour.The YouGov projection follows a similar poll by modelling site Electoral Calculus, which came out on 31 May. The polling also compares the 2019 result with Electoral Calculus' projection.It predicts that Labour is on course to win an even bigger majority of 319 seats - with Starmer's party picking up 485 MPs and the Tories way behind with 66. The modelling shows the Lib Dems getting very close to the Conservative Party, with 59 seats.While Electoral Calculus' polling, based on opinion polls from 8 May to 20 May, returns a different set of projections to YouGov's, both clearly indicate the scale of the problem facing Sunak.The Electoral Calculus model has predicted Sir Keir Starmer's Labour will win a massive majority.

The Guardian,Senior Tory criticises ‘worst campaign in my lifetime’ as frustration grows,[],Rowena Mason and Kiran Stacey,2 July 2024 at 0:00 am·5-min read,2,July,2024,00:00:00,5,"Recriminations have begun to fly around the Conservatives as a senior figure called the last few weeks the “worst campaign in my lifetime” and criticised the party for failing to tackle the threat from Reform.Rishi Sunak started the week with warnings against handing Labour a “supermajority” and a “blank cheque” and claimed a vote for Reform would hand more power to Keir Starmer.However, a number of Tory candidates, advisers and officials are deeply frustrated with how he has run the campaign after calling a July election against the advice of his key strategist Isaac Levido.One senior Tory party figure said on Monday it had been the “worst campaign in my lifetime”, saying that while Sunak was wholly to blame for the early election, there was a feeling that Levido could have pushed back more against the July date and that Conservative HQ should have “taken the fight to Reform” earlier.They said Levido had made it clear from the start that 2019 Tory switchers from Labour were “gone and never coming back”, telling candidates that all their efforts should be made to target potential Reform voters instead.However, the source said some people around the cabinet table had argued that the Tories should just ignore Nigel Farage’s party, and the campaign had been too frightened to tackle Reform’s arguments head-on for fear of offending voters who sympathised with them.The senior figure said the mood among many Tory candidates was that it was “tough out there”, while those whose seats were less difficult were “focusing on what’s left and what’s next” – a new Conservative leadership battle.They also said candidates in tight marginal seats were getting zero financial or practical support, even on social media, and there was frustration that Conservative HQ had either overspent in the run-up to the election or wrongly thought it would get a last-minute deluge of funding.There is also suspicion among some Tory candidates that CCHQ could be holding back some funding to rebuild the party after an election defeat rather than going all-out on defending candidates.Many Conservative candidates are upset that they do not feel as supported by CCHQ as they were in 2019, with top party figures and cabinet ministers having to spend time defending or winning their own seats rather than on national strategy.One Tory candidate defending a majority of more than 10,000 in the south-east said they had had to raise all their own funding for their local campaign and felt it would be “very tight” against the Liberal Democrats.Another contrasted their local campaign with the national one. “The local party has been really efficient at identifying the messages that resonate and getting leaflets out to the right people,” they said. “As for the national campaign, well, I know all campaigns have mistakes but I’ve never seen anything like this.”One senior Tory claimed the only message that was resonating with the party’s voters was the line that failing to vote Conservative would hand Labour a supermajority on Thursday. They pointed out that the warning had been made largely off-the-cuff during a broadcast interview with Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, rather than as part of the prime minister’s strategy.In an interview with the Times, Starmer said such a majority would allow Labour to “roll up our sleeves and get on with the change we need”, saying the party needs a strong mandate to make changes the “whole country” wants.At a rally in Oxfordshire on Tuesday, Sunak will appeal to wavering voters to lend him their support to stop Labour winning by a huge margin, saying the result is “not a foregone conclusion”.“If just 130,000 people switch their vote and lend us their support, we can deny Starmer that supermajority,” he will say. “Just think about that: you have the power to use your vote to prevent an unchecked Labour government.”On Monday, Sunak rejected the idea that he had failed to tackle the threat of Reform as he toured a warehouse owned by the Tory donor Zameer Choudrey.Asked what he would say to those who thought he should have confronted Farage’s arguments head-on, he said: “I think it’s not right [to say that] because in the first week I said a vote for anyone else including Reform is a vote to put Keir Starmer in power. I’ve been consistent in that throughout the campaign. That’s the reality.“If you are someone who wants control of illegal migration then a vote for anyone not Conservative means a vote for someone who will make us the soft touch of Europe.”Pressed on whether it was right to have gone for an early election given he has acknowledged that the polls point to a Labour supermajority, Sunak insisted his timing had been right as the economy was looking up.He twice refused to comment on questions about what he thought about the rise of the far right in France, saying he was focused on the UK and his own campaign.Sunak hinted he might stay on as Conservative leader for a few months after the election if there was demand for him to do so while the party elects a new one, saying: “I love this party dearly and of course I’ll always put myself at the service of it, and the service of my country.”"
Yahoo News UK,"Will Nigel Farage's Reform UK 'beat' the Tories in the election?With some polling figures putting the Tories and Reform UK nearly neck and neck, could Farage's party really end up with nearly as many MPs as Sunak's?","['What do the latest polls say?', 'Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?', 'Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?', 'What is proportional representation?']",James Cheng-Morris and  Ellen Manning,Updated 14 June 2024 at 6:33 am·7-min read,14,June,2024,06:33:00,7,"Leading pollster John Curtice has poured cold water on suggestions that Reform UK is now beating the Conservative Party in the general election polls.As representatives from seven parties took prepared to take part in a TV debate on Thursday, a YouGov survey for The Times newspaper said Reform’s support had increased by two points to 19%, putting them ahead of the Tories for the first time.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage took the the opportunity to hail the poll results in the debate, declaring: “We are now the opposition to Labour.”But Curtice urged caution, insisting that single polls should not be relied on. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""This is one poll - we’ve actually, I think, had four other polls published in the last 24 hours - none of which have had Reform ahead, not even all of which have had Reform gaining ground, but quite a couple of them certainly suggesting it’s also got very close.""He said it may not be the case that Reform are ahead - and could be on average four or five points behind. But he said: ""This is still bad news for the Conservatives. The only way Rishi Sunak can hope to get even to base camp in narrowing the lead that Labour have started off with this campaign was to squeeze the Reform vote.""He added: ""Rather than making progress, things are actually going backwards, not least of course because of Nigel Farage’s decision to fight this campaign.""With many speculating that Reform UK with Farage at the helm could ""beat"" the Tories, Yahoo News UK takes a look.What do the latest polls say?YouGov’s voting intention tracker, updated on Tuesday, suggests the Tories and Reform UK are neck and neck.With Labour well ahead on 38%, the Tories are trailing on 18% – compared to a high of 53% under Boris Johnson in 2020 – with Reform UK just behind on 17% and the Liberal Democrats on 15%.However, there are multiple polls taking place at any one time by a number of different companies.According to the PA news agency, an average of all polls that were carried out wholly or partly during the seven days to June 13 puts Labour on 43%, 21 points ahead of the Conservatives on 22%, followed by Reform on 14%, the Lib Dems on 10% and the Greens on 6%.And while Reform’s average is up one percentage point on the figure for the previous week and the Tories are down one point, there is still an eight-point gap, on average, between the two.Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?Unless something remarkable happens, in short: 'No' - and that's because of the first past the post (FPTP) voting system in which the candidate with the largest number of votes in their constituency is elected.According to the Electoral Reform Society, which is against FPTP, this system leads to a situation where “even if millions of voters support the same party, if they are thinly spread out across the UK they may only get the largest number of votes in a couple of these contests – so only win a few MPs"".“Tens of thousands of voters supporting a different party, but who live near each other, could end up with more MPs. This means the number of MPs a party has in parliament rarely matches their popularity with the public.”Rishi Sunak on the campaign trail on Wednesday. (AFP via Getty Images)Farage knows this well. As the leader of UKIP in the 2015 election, he saw his party win 12.6% of the nationwide vote and one seat. The Liberal Democrats won 7.9% of the vote... and eight seats.Indeed, YouGov last week released a poll – put together using the multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) surveying technique, from a sample size of nearly 60,000 respondents – which suggested the Tories would win just 140 seats, having won 365 in 2019. But this is still 140 more than the zero it projected Reform UK to win, in spite of its strong polling figures.The model had Reform UK ""performing strongly in a number of seats but still a long way off winning in any"", with projected second-placed finishes in 27 constituencies.YouGov's MRP projection. (YouGov)Granted, this model was formed between 24 May and 1 June, before Farage's headline-grabbing intervention on Monday last week in which he announced he would be standing as an MP.But, even as Reform UK polls closer than ever to the Tories, it's difficult to imagine the party winning more than a handful of seats.Chris Hopkins, director at polling firm Savanta, told Yahoo News UK that in one respect, Reform UK is at an advantage compared to Ukip in 2015 because ""Ukip took votes from both Labour and the Conservatives, and we are not seeing that with Reform UK – they are all coming from the Conservatives.""That is the consequence of Rishi Sunak making immigration a centrepiece of the campaign and failing to deliver on it. Even if you have voters that are neutral on immigration, they would say the small boats policy has been a disaster.""But even so, Hopkins said, Reform UK is still ""at a huge electoral disadvantage"" in that its votes are not very concentrated, they are very evenly spread.""There are going to be some races where Reform UK is strong - the Nigel Farage factor in Clacton is really interesting - but realistically its ceiling is five seats: and that’s a high ceiling.""Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey on a campaign visit in Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire, on Wednesday. (PA)Like Reform UK, Sir Ed Davey’s Liberal Democrats are performing well in the polls.In a sign of how defensive the Tory campaign is becoming, one online party advert claims voting for Reform UK or the Lib Dems could give Labour 100 extra seats, resulting in the biggest majority in its history.It depicts a scenario where the Conservatives are beaten into third place behind the Lib Dems, with just 57 seats, despite getting 19% of the vote and without Reform winning a single seat.Read more: Pollsters got it wrong in 2015, so could Labour’s lead be overestimated? (The Guardian)However, it remains unlikely the Lib Dems will finish second. YouGov’s MRP poll projected the party performing strongly, winning 48 seats. This would be up 37 from 2019, but still nowhere near the Tories’ projected 140.However, amid all this talk about projections, it’s worth remembering they are still only polls and not a definite indicator of how people will vote on 4 July. The 1992 and 2015 elections are notable examples of how polling didn’t match the end results of Tory wins.What is proportional representation?Proportional representation, as defined by the UK parliament, is an electoral system ""in which the distribution of seats corresponds closely with the proportion of the total votes cast for each party. For example, if a party gained 40% of the total votes, a perfectly proportional system would allow them to gain 40% of the seats.""This differs from the first past the post system, as set out above, in that a relatively high vote share rarely corresponds with increased seats for the smaller parties. In 2019, for example, the Lib Dems won 11.5% of the vote but only 1.7% – 11 – of the 650 seats.Unsurprisingly, both Reform UK and the Lib Dems support proportional representation.The Lib Dems this week made it part of their manifesto, with the party saying it would introduce the single transferrable vote method, a form of proportional representation which allows electors to rank their preference of candidates on the ballot.The party previously sought to change the UK’s voting system while in the coalition government under then-leader Nick Clegg, but voters rejected the plan in a 2011 referendum.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

Many also assume his title is hereditary.Here's what you need to know about the personal life of the man who wants to be the UK’s next prime minister.His early lifeStarmer was born in Southwark, south London, in 1962, as the second of four children. His parents were Labour Party members and named him after Keir Hardie, the party’s first leader in parliament.The family moved out of the capital and he grew up in Hurst Green, a village just outside the small Surrey town of Oxted. He was active in youth politics from his teenage years but was also a skilled musician, taking music lessons alongside Norman Cook, who later became better known as a member of The Housemartins and the DJ Fatboy Slim.Starmer played the flute, piano, violin and recorder and was a junior exhibitioner at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.His familyStarmer with his wife, Lady Victoria Starmer, at the Labour Party Conference in October 2023. (Alamy)Starmer is married to Victoria, a former solicitor who later retrained in occupational health and now works for the NHS. The pair met through their work in the law in the early 2000s and married in Essex in 2007.She was first seen accompanying her husband when the couple were filmed clapping for carers during the pandemic in 2020 outside their home in Camden. They have two children, a son and daughter, but both are kept out of the public eye.Victoria's father was Jewish and originally came from Poland, while her mother converted when they got married. Starmer has said in a previous interview that ""my wife in particular wants our children to know the faith of her family"" and that they ""observe some of the practices, for example Friday night prayers"".His parentsKeir Starmer with parents, Rodney and Josephine, at his graduation. (Twitter/Keir Starmer)The Labour leader's father, Rodney Starmer, worked as a toolmaker in a factory, and his mother Josephine Starmer (née Baker), was a nurse.His father worked long, 14-hour days but spent his time outside work caring for Josephine, who was diagnosed with the autoimmune condition Still’s disease. She required two hip and knee replacements twice in her lifetime and struggled with arthritic pain.As a young man Starmer also helped care for his mother, which he has said led to him being more emotionally reserved. His sister, Katy, recalled: “He’s had to be a grown-up all his life. I’ve always been quite open about my feelings – Keir is good at most things, but not that.” Josephine Starmer died in 2015, and his father three years later.His educationA photograph of a younger Starmer as shown on ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories in 2021. (ITV)Starmer passed the 11-plus examination, and attended Reigate Grammar School from age 11. While he was at the school it became an independent fee-paying institution, but as an existing student he was exempt from fees, and his tuition in the sixth form was covered by a bursary.After school he studied law at the University of Leeds, this first in his family to attend university, graduating with a first class degree in 1985. He undertook postgraduate law studied at the University of Oxford, where he served as editor of a radical magazine, Socialist Alternatives.Why is he a sir?Keir Starmer pictured in 2010, when he was director of public prosecutions, making a statement about MPs who face charges over their expenses claims. (Getty)Starmer was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 2014 in recognition of his work in the legal profession, culminating in a five-year term as director of public prosecutions (DPP).He first became a barrister in 1987 at the Middle Temple, later joining Doughty Street Chambers and was appointed a Queen’s counsel in 2002, aged just 39. In 2008 he was appointed head of the Crown Prosecution Service and DPP.During his tenure he chose to prosecute three Labour MPs and a Conservative in the wake of the parliamentary expenses scandal, and was responsible for prosecuting former MP Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce for perverting the course of justice after Pryce claimed responsibility for her former husband’s speeding offence."
The Independent,Sunak in last-ditch attempt to rally Conservative voters with threat of a Labour ‘supermajority’,[],David Maddox,2 July 2024 at 3:24 am·6-min read,2,July,2024,03:24:00,6,"Rishi Sunak has started a 48-hour blitz around the country with a desperate final appeal to voters to support him in order to “stop a Labour supermajority”.The prime minister kicked off a final push on the last two days of a dramatic general election campaign, with a speech claiming that just 130,000 voters could make the difference.He told demoralised supporters and party activists to remember the spirit of the England football team pulling level in the 95th minute on Sunday, saying: “It’s not over until it’s over.” It comes as:Sir Keir Starmer starts his own final push in the key battleground of the MidlandsA leading pollster warned the result will be much closer than the polls seem to indicateTory MPs in the North and Midlands said they believe they are in close fights and can winLabour privately warned the polls may have made their supporters complacentSupport for Nigel Farage’s Reform UK appears to be ebbingRishi Sunak says he has not given up hope (PA)In a speech on Tuesday as he fires up his battle bus for a whistle-stop tour, the prime minister will say: “The outcome of this election is not a foregone conclusion. If just 130,000 people switch their vote and lend us their support, we can deny Starmer that supermajority.“Just think about that: you have the power to use your vote to prevent an unchecked Labour government.“So we must redouble our efforts in these final days, and deliver the strongest Conservative voice in the next parliament. We are fighting for the future of our country, and every door we knock on, every leaflet we deliver and every call we do will make a difference.”Mr Sunak will point out that “a huge number of seats” in this election “will be decided by just hundreds of votes”.He will add: “So, every vote we move will have an impact, and make it more likely that your Conservative candidate is returned to parliament so that they can be your voice, represent your values and stand up for you. And prevent Labour from rewriting the rules so that they can stay in power for decades.”It comes after he tried to whip up concerns about defence under a Labour government, just as new figures revealed the Tories cut 23 army regiments over the course of their 14 years in power.Conservative peer Robert Hayward believes the result may be closer than the polls suggest (PA)But Mr Sunak’s analysis that the election is much closer than many believe it to be is supported by leading pollster and Conservative peer Robert Hayward.Lord Hayward correctly predicted the Tory victory in 1992, despite the polls suggesting that Labour was going to win power. He also predicted a victory for the Conservative Party in 2015, and its failure to win in 2017, in spite of what the polls were saying.He now believes the polls are wrong again, and is particularly critical of MRP polls, which claim to be more accurate than others.He said: “I see no evidence, broadly, that the polls are any better now. The difficulty they face is that you have a volatile electorate.“We’ve got large numbers of undecideds, so it makes it very difficult to be sure as to how accurate the polls are, and I think they are inaccurate. I think they are overestimating the Labour Party. They’re underestimating the Conservatives. Some have overestimated Reform.“I think, having said that, the errors are not going to mean that it’s anything other than a clear Labour majority – but there is still a lot to fight for, and a great deal of uncertainty.”Lord Hayward said Labour may fail to gain seats in some parts of the North and the Midlands, because traditional support for the party among Muslim voters has switched to Muslim independent candidates.He also believes the problem of racists supporting Reform UK has hit that party’s vote share, which he believes will top out at around 13 per cent and is now falling.He added: “There will be parts of the Reform vote in places like Lincolnshire, which might have been strong but will be offended at the suggestion that they are actually racist, and will therefore not necessarily vote Reform. They might all go back to the Tories, but I think there are parts of the country where that sort of thing will be more damaging than others. Three days out, Reform’s vote is not stable and is dropping.”Nigel Farage speaks to the media following Reform UK’s Birmingham rally on Sunday (PA)Lord Hayward was dismissive of the MRP polls.He said: “These are supposedly authoritative indications, but ... you have MRP polls suggesting the Tories are going to get 50 seats, 100 seats and 150 seats, all within 24 hours of each other. That’s a 300 per cent inaccuracy.“But the ultimate MRP idiocy is Exmouth and Exeter East, where MRP polls have suggested that four different political parties are going to win the seat.”He also notes that the polls were “not borne out” in the local elections, where the Tories easily outperformed their predicted results, and that they have also been confounded by a series of council by-elections in the last few months.Lord Hayward’s analysis is supported by feedback from Conservatives in the so-called red wall areas in the North and Midlands.In the North East, Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen, who held on in May despite what the polls suggested, told The Independent: “It’s pretty positive. I’m hopeful if our data is right.”A number of Tory MPs in the North West, Midlands and Yorkshire believe they can hold on, including in one constituency where the bookmakers are quoting 10/1 on a Conservative victory. The polls would suggest they have no chance.Bassetlaw MP Brendan Clarke-Smith, who thinks his seat is too close to call, has suggested that Reform UK are picking up more Labour voters in his area.This is backed up by a JL Partners poll that claims that Reform UK is now taking 7 per cent of Labour’s 2019 vote, a statistically significant increase from 3 per cent last week.However, the Conservatives are far more gloomy about the south of England – the so-called blue wall of traditionally safe Tory seats – where they expect to suffer significant losses, including potentially a number of cabinet ministers, headed by chancellor Jeremy Hunt in Surrey.Candidates in seats where the party has a majority of less than 10,000 have been told to go and help those with larger majorities instead of trying to defend their own seats.However, it is understood that Labour is “nervous” about the result, with so many undecided voters.Polling by Techne UK for The Independent last week showed that a third of voters have described themselves as either “won’t vote” (24 per cent) or “undecided” (9 per cent). Postal voting has already begun, but more than three-quarters of people who intend to vote will not do so until Thursday at the polling station."

Explaining why this is such a big deal in the world of political modelling, JLP says: ""The main advantage of this kind of stacking is that we can use different models to probe different parts of the data giving a more holistic set of predictions that consider many different facets of the data.""This includes models that are superior at unpicking the constituency level predictors whilst other models can investigate the individual level effects in much more detail.""Some models, like multilevel regression, can analyse both the individual level and constituency level data simultaneously. The combination of these models then produces estimates that more accurately represent the nuances in the underlying data.""Other noteworthy prediction in JLP's model, described as a ""super poll"" by the Times' chief political commentator Tim Shipman, is Reform UK winning two seats, with Nigel Farage predicted to win Clacton and Lee Anderson, who defected from the Tories in March, keeping hold of Ashfield.The Liberal Democrats are also tracked to regain their place as the third party of British politics, going from just 11 seats in the Commons to 55, while the Scottish National Party (SNP) are set to lose 33 seats, leaving only 15.The level of detail in JLP's model means the company has been able to put together a list of major Conservative MPs expected to lose their seats, including Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Grant Shapps, Mel Stride and Esther McVey.You can search for your constituency to find the projected winner and their margin of victory here. Reform UK snapping at Tories' heels as Labour takes dipYouGov's voting intention tracker currently predicts Labour to win 37% of the vote.Although it is still by far the highest scoring political party, it is a significant drop from the 47% recorded on 28 May – six days after Sunak called a surprise snap general election.There is only a 2% margin between Reform UK and the Tories, according to YouGov, with the Conservative's projected to win 20% of the vote, compared to 18% for Nigel Farage's party.Labour vote share drops to 'lowest in over two years'In another sign that Labour's success has plateaued, a recent poll for the Telegraph suggests there is only a 17% gap between the Tories and Starmer's party.This would leave Labour with its lowest predicted vote share since January 2022, when Boris Johnson was still prime minister, according to pollsters Savanta.However, this is unlikely to worry Starmer, as the poll still puts Labour on track to win 38% of the vote and a majority of more than 260 seats.🚨NEW Westminster Voting Intention for Sunday @Telegraph📈Lowest Labour vote share since January 2022🌹Lab 38 (-4)🌳Con 21 (=)➡️Reform 14 (=)🔶LD 11 (+1)🌍Green 6 (+1)🎗️SNP 2 (-1)⬜️Other 7 (+1)2,092 UK adults26-28 June (chg from 21-24 June) pic.twitter.com/cdyp3lJygQ— Savanta UK (@Savanta_UK) June 29, 2024Chris Hopkins, the director of political research at Savanta, told the Telegraph: “This is our lowest Labour vote share since Rishi Sunak became prime minister, and the Conservatives for their part do appear to have slowed or stopped their downward spiral.""He added that a rise in vote share for the Green Party and independent candidates will not have a significant impact on election day but could ""point towards trouble for the Labour Party in government and over the coming years"".What are the latest odds?As of 1 July, Oddschecker – a website which compares odds across different bookmakers – had Labour at 1/41 to win the most seats.

It's worth looking back on an extremely eventful four-and-a-half years in UK politics.According to YouGov's voting intention tracker (see chart above), Tory support peaked at 53%, with Labour on 32%, in April 2020, months after the party's stunning success in the 2019 general election and Boris Johnson's pledge to “get Brexit done”. That month also saw Starmer take over as Labour leader from Jeremy Corbyn.This was also amid a spirit of national unity following the onset of the COVID pandemic which nearly killed Johnson himself. The then-PM had been released from hospital five days before this particular survey was taken.Boris Johnson delivers his final speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street in September 2022. (AFP via Getty Images)Over the rest of the year, there was a downturn in support amid chaos over COVID rules, with the Tories falling as low as 35% in November 2020, compared to Labour on 40%.However, the UK’s successful COVID vaccination programme provided a pathway out of lockdown and with it, improved poll ratings. Tory support peaked at 41% in June 2021, with Labour at 30%.In October that year, there was a sense Johnson was untouchable. At the Tory party conference, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg remarked how the PM was ""in total command of his party, and politically dominant in the country"".But this fell apart quickly with the Partygate scandal, which emerged in November that year. Time and again, reports emerged of government and Tory staff – including Johnson – having taken part in lockdown-era social gatherings when their own COVID rules had prohibited them.By January 2022, Tory support had plummeted to 28%, with Labour on 38%. Johnson struggled on, but never recovered and a wave of ministerial resignations forced him to resign in July that year.The UK had three separate prime ministers – Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak – between 6 September and 24 October, 2022. (Getty Images)His successor, Liz Truss, then embarked on arguably the most disastrous prime ministerial reign in history, characterised by the catastrophic ""mini-budget"", containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, which prompted an economic crisis. Like Johnson, she lost the confidence of Tory MPs – and voters – and had to resign.Her 49-day spell as PM was the shortest in history, with Tory support plummeting to 19% (with Labour on 56%) the day after she announced her resignation in October 2022.Rishi Sunak, who had lost to Truss in the previous month's Tory leadership election, took over. However, as the above YouGov chart indicates, he has failed to cut through with voters. Tory support was at 23% two days after he assumed office, with the most recent survey, carried out on Thursday, showing support is now lower than under Truss at 18%.In short, the polls and odds, not to mention other factors such as notable by-election victories for Starmer's Labour, are pointing to a Labour government next week.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

HuffPost UK,Sky Presenter Instantly Calls Out Minister For Distorting Claim Starmer Stops Work At 6pm,[],Kate Nicholson,2 July 2024 at 2:56 am·3-min read,2,July,2024,02:56:00,3,"Matt Barbet grilled Maria Caulfield on Sky News SkyA Sky News presenter refused this morning to let a Tory minister twist Keir Starmer’s revelation that he does not like working late on Fridays.The Labour leader – who has a 20-point lead over the Tories in the polls – told Virgin Radio he “will not do a work-related thing after six o’clock, pretty well come what may” on a Friday night, so he can spend time with his family.But the Tories have attacked Starmer already over this, saying he would be a “part-time prime minister”.On Tuesday, Sky host Matt Barbet asked Tory candidate and health minister Maria Caufield: “How important to you is work life balance?”She replied: “It is pretty important but I would say as a minister, it’s not really that feasible.“Probably what you’re alluding to Keir Starmer saying that he’ll do a four-day week and finish at six o’clock every evening –”Before she could even get to the end of her sentence, Barbet said: “No – no, no, no, no.“He didn’t say he was going to do a four-day week, he said he was going to finish work at six o’clock on a Friday, like many people do.“And I believe that’s to help his wife observe her Jewish faith, which is commonplace amongst Jewish people.“So not a four-day week, that’s not true.”Caulfield largely ignored the correction but said she was also a person of faith and believes a “work-life balance is extremely important”.However, she claimed Starmer “has indicated that he wants to have a more flexible working life approach”.Caulfield continued: “That’s just not possible. I’m a junior minister, I work seven days a week, often close to 20-hour days, so it is slightly concerning that’s the approach he’s taking.“And he’s never been a minister. He’s probably not aware of the extreme pressures you’re under. Yes, it’s important, of course it’s important, and you make better decisions when you have a good work-life balance.“But when you’re running the country you do have to put the country before your party and a lot of other things, as well.”She said she was also a carer, but “your family does suffer” when you’re in government.Barbet pushed: “Why though? Does that set a good example – job first, family second? What are the most important things in life if not your family, your children. He’s a dad of school-age children.“So surely you would not begrudge the man – if he does become prime minister – if he does spend time with his kids?”She said PM Rishi Sunak also has two young children, and to do the government job well, it takes time and sacrifice.Barbet noted: “Why in this country do we champion working all the hours God sends?“Maybe that’s why, as a minister, your Conservative colleagues have decided it’s just not worth it and are not running in the election.”Seventy-four Tory MPs previously announced they were standing down at this election.Caulfield said that if Labour will the election, many of its MPs will realise just “what a tough job it is” being in power.""[Sir Keir Starmer has] never been a minister. He probably is not aware of the extreme pressures that you're under.""Tory candidate @mariacaulfield says ""many in the Labour Party"" will see ""what a tough job it is"" if they win the election.https://t.co/xItZsH7tea📺 Sky 501 pic.twitter.com/Ngt6sGDpC6— Sky News (@SkyNews) July 2, 2024Related...Keir Starmer Vows To Quit As Labour Leader If He Loses The Election'That Is A Lie': Starmer Condemns Sunak Over Labour Tax Claims In Angry DebateKeir Starmer Says His Teenage Children Are 'Worried' About Him Becoming Prime Minister"
