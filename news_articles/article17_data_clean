Yahoo News UK,"Three important UK election issues, explainedRishi Sunak said his leadership is needed in 'uncertain' times. Keir Starmer said the country needs to be 'rebuilt'. So what issues do voters care about most?","['The economy', 'Health', 'Immigration and asylum']",James Cheng-Morris,Updated 28 May 2024 at 11:11 am·5-min read,28,May,2024,11:11:00,5,"After months of speculation, Rishi Sunak confirmed the general election will be held on 4 July.The prime minister said Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer could not be trusted to lead the country through “uncertain” times. He made the economy and combating global security the key elements of his pitch to the nation as he announced the election date.In response, Starmer told voters: “Together we can stop the chaos, we can turn the page, we can start to rebuild Britain.”But amid this “uncertainty” and need to “rebuild”, what do the voters consider the key issues?This chart, produced using YouGov polling over the course of this parliament, offers an insight in the issues voters care most about and how that has ebbed and flowed over time.Compared to when Boris Johnson's Tories won the December 2019 poll, the economy, immigration, defence and tax have grown in importance in the eyes of the electorate. This has come amid the cost of living crisis; small boats crossing the English Channel; the onset of the Ukraine war and wider global instability; and the highest tax burden in 70 years.Housing has also become a bigger concern, with the Renters Reform Bill - in which the government pledged to scrap no-fault evictions - having been paused after Sunak called the election.Meanwhile, the last general election was fought - and won by the Tories - on a single issue: Brexit. Yet the chart shows a clear downturn in its relevance among voters, particularly after a trade deal was agreed with the EU in December 2020.This next chart, meanwhile, highlights what voters have considered the top issues over the past year. By a wide margin, the top three are the economy, health and immigration and asylum.Here, Yahoo News UK breaks down what is behind these issues and how they have ebbed and flowed in importance among voters since the last election in 2019.The economyThe unprecedented lockdown called by Boris Johnson in March 2020 meant the public’s attention shifted to the economy, as demonstrated by the huge spike in the chart above. The then-chancellor Rishi Sunak was forced to implement a £70bn furlough scheme, lasting 18 months, to protect people’s jobs.There was a second almighty economic shock - and rise in public concern - in February 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This caused a further spike in an already turbulent wholesale energy market, driving up costs for suppliers and ultimately customers.Average energy bills eventually reached £2,500 a year (and would have exceeded £4,000 had the government not intervened). This was double the £1,278 consumers were paying before the war and by the time this election takes place, people will still be paying much more than this: £1,568.Energy prices were also a key driver in inflation reaching 11.1% - a 41-year high - by October 2022, though it has since fallen to 2.3%, which is near the Bank of England’s 2.0% target.The third economic shock of this parliament - and most damaging for the Tories - was in October 2022 when Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng's disastrous “mini budget”, containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, prompted an economic crisis. It led to soaring interest rates, and to this day homeowners who are remortgaging are facing significantly higher bills.HealthHealth, like the economy, is another issue which clearly correlated with the beginning of the pandemic. The above chart shows an enormous spike in public concern when COVID cases started to multiply in March 2020, ultimately leading to the nationwide lockdown as the NHS faced collapse.Cases fell that summer, but spikes in the chart can be seen once infections rose again and fresh nationwide lockdowns were imposed in October 2020 and January 2021. By March 2022, likely as concerns over the Omicron variant faded, there was much less concern about health.In January last year, there was a brief spike as the NHS in England experienced the biggest industrial action in its history, with tens of thousands of nurses and ambulance staff walking out simultaneously.As for the state of play going into the election, NHS waiting lists remain higher than they were when Sunak vowed to cut them last year. According to the latest figures, an estimated 7.54 million treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of March, relating to 6.29 million patients.Immigration and asylumSince the last election, the immigration and asylum narrative has largely revolved around one issue: small boats crossing the English Channel.The numbers have risen in most of the intervening years: there were 1,843 crossings in 2019, 8,466 in 2020, 28,526 in 2021, 45,774 in 2022 and 29,437 last year. This year, the number has already passed the 10,000 mark.The regular sharp spikes in the above chart demonstrate how frequently crossings have been in the news, including some occasions when hundreds of migrants have made the dangerous journey in a single day.But it also reflects how the government has made this part of its own agenda. It was Boris Johnson’s government which first announced plans to deport migrants to Rwanda in April 2022. That policy was picked up by Rishi Sunak when he became prime minister in October that year, with Sunak since repeating his pledge to “stop the boats”.But after calling the election, Sunak admitted this week that flights would not take off before the country goes to the polls.Read moreFive important laws that could be dropped due to Sunak's snap election (Yahoo News UK)OPINION - Rishi Sunak has been in last-ditch campaign mode for so long — a General Election is logical (Evening Standard)Door open for Boris Johnson to campaign for Tories, Rishi Sunak signals (PA Media)"

SOPA Images via Getty ImagesNearly 40% of young people do not intend to vote in the general election, according to a shock poll.The Techne survey for Independent Media revealed that a quarter of 18 to 34-year-olds say they have not even registered to vote less than two weeks before the country goes to the polls.The findings have led to fears that the main political parties are failing to do enough to engage with young people.According to the poll, just 57% of 18 to 34-year-olds say they are registered and will vote on July 4.That compares with more than 80% of those aged between 35 and 64.A further 17% of young people say they are registered but will not vote, while 22% are not registered and have no plans to do so.That means a total of 39% of young people say they will not vote in the election.By contrast, only 17% of 35 to 44-year-olds, 16% of 45 to 54-year-olds and 15% of 55 to 64-year-olds say they won’t vote.Leading pollster and Tory peer Lord Hayward described the figure of younger people not wanting to vote as “very high” for this stage of an election campaign.He said: “That is what we would expect for a normal turnout in terms of people not voting. But you have to remember that among the 59% who say they will vote a sizeable number of them will also not vote.”He added: “The problem is that 18 to 34-year-olds do not identify with any of the political parties or are particularly taken by the agenda.“Another poll the other day by Savanta showed how young voters are abandoning the Labour Party.”Related...Rishi Sunak Squirms As He Fails To Deny Tory Cabinet Members May Have Placed Election BetsA Former Tory Minister Has Revealed He Is Voting Labour In The General ElectionAre The Tories Running The Worst General Election Campaign Of All Time?"
Yahoo News UK,"Will Nigel Farage's Reform UK 'beat' the Tories in the election?With some polling figures putting the Tories and Reform UK nearly neck and neck, could Farage's party really end up with nearly as many MPs as Sunak's?","['What do the latest polls say?', 'Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?', 'Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?', 'What is proportional representation?']",James Cheng-Morris and  Ellen Manning,Updated 14 June 2024 at 6:33 am·7-min read,14,June,2024,06:33:00,7,"Leading pollster John Curtice has poured cold water on suggestions that Reform UK is now beating the Conservative Party in the general election polls.As representatives from seven parties took prepared to take part in a TV debate on Thursday, a YouGov survey for The Times newspaper said Reform’s support had increased by two points to 19%, putting them ahead of the Tories for the first time.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage took the the opportunity to hail the poll results in the debate, declaring: “We are now the opposition to Labour.”But Curtice urged caution, insisting that single polls should not be relied on. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""This is one poll - we’ve actually, I think, had four other polls published in the last 24 hours - none of which have had Reform ahead, not even all of which have had Reform gaining ground, but quite a couple of them certainly suggesting it’s also got very close.""He said it may not be the case that Reform are ahead - and could be on average four or five points behind. But he said: ""This is still bad news for the Conservatives. The only way Rishi Sunak can hope to get even to base camp in narrowing the lead that Labour have started off with this campaign was to squeeze the Reform vote.""He added: ""Rather than making progress, things are actually going backwards, not least of course because of Nigel Farage’s decision to fight this campaign.""With many speculating that Reform UK with Farage at the helm could ""beat"" the Tories, Yahoo News UK takes a look.What do the latest polls say?YouGov’s voting intention tracker, updated on Tuesday, suggests the Tories and Reform UK are neck and neck.With Labour well ahead on 38%, the Tories are trailing on 18% – compared to a high of 53% under Boris Johnson in 2020 – with Reform UK just behind on 17% and the Liberal Democrats on 15%.However, there are multiple polls taking place at any one time by a number of different companies.According to the PA news agency, an average of all polls that were carried out wholly or partly during the seven days to June 13 puts Labour on 43%, 21 points ahead of the Conservatives on 22%, followed by Reform on 14%, the Lib Dems on 10% and the Greens on 6%.And while Reform’s average is up one percentage point on the figure for the previous week and the Tories are down one point, there is still an eight-point gap, on average, between the two.Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?Unless something remarkable happens, in short: 'No' - and that's because of the first past the post (FPTP) voting system in which the candidate with the largest number of votes in their constituency is elected.According to the Electoral Reform Society, which is against FPTP, this system leads to a situation where “even if millions of voters support the same party, if they are thinly spread out across the UK they may only get the largest number of votes in a couple of these contests – so only win a few MPs"".“Tens of thousands of voters supporting a different party, but who live near each other, could end up with more MPs. This means the number of MPs a party has in parliament rarely matches their popularity with the public.”Rishi Sunak on the campaign trail on Wednesday. (AFP via Getty Images)Farage knows this well. As the leader of UKIP in the 2015 election, he saw his party win 12.6% of the nationwide vote and one seat. The Liberal Democrats won 7.9% of the vote... and eight seats.Indeed, YouGov last week released a poll – put together using the multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) surveying technique, from a sample size of nearly 60,000 respondents – which suggested the Tories would win just 140 seats, having won 365 in 2019. But this is still 140 more than the zero it projected Reform UK to win, in spite of its strong polling figures.The model had Reform UK ""performing strongly in a number of seats but still a long way off winning in any"", with projected second-placed finishes in 27 constituencies.YouGov's MRP projection. (YouGov)Granted, this model was formed between 24 May and 1 June, before Farage's headline-grabbing intervention on Monday last week in which he announced he would be standing as an MP.But, even as Reform UK polls closer than ever to the Tories, it's difficult to imagine the party winning more than a handful of seats.Chris Hopkins, director at polling firm Savanta, told Yahoo News UK that in one respect, Reform UK is at an advantage compared to Ukip in 2015 because ""Ukip took votes from both Labour and the Conservatives, and we are not seeing that with Reform UK – they are all coming from the Conservatives.""That is the consequence of Rishi Sunak making immigration a centrepiece of the campaign and failing to deliver on it. Even if you have voters that are neutral on immigration, they would say the small boats policy has been a disaster.""But even so, Hopkins said, Reform UK is still ""at a huge electoral disadvantage"" in that its votes are not very concentrated, they are very evenly spread.""There are going to be some races where Reform UK is strong - the Nigel Farage factor in Clacton is really interesting - but realistically its ceiling is five seats: and that’s a high ceiling.""Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey on a campaign visit in Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire, on Wednesday. (PA)Like Reform UK, Sir Ed Davey’s Liberal Democrats are performing well in the polls.In a sign of how defensive the Tory campaign is becoming, one online party advert claims voting for Reform UK or the Lib Dems could give Labour 100 extra seats, resulting in the biggest majority in its history.It depicts a scenario where the Conservatives are beaten into third place behind the Lib Dems, with just 57 seats, despite getting 19% of the vote and without Reform winning a single seat.Read more: Pollsters got it wrong in 2015, so could Labour’s lead be overestimated? (The Guardian)However, it remains unlikely the Lib Dems will finish second. YouGov’s MRP poll projected the party performing strongly, winning 48 seats. This would be up 37 from 2019, but still nowhere near the Tories’ projected 140.However, amid all this talk about projections, it’s worth remembering they are still only polls and not a definite indicator of how people will vote on 4 July. The 1992 and 2015 elections are notable examples of how polling didn’t match the end results of Tory wins.What is proportional representation?Proportional representation, as defined by the UK parliament, is an electoral system ""in which the distribution of seats corresponds closely with the proportion of the total votes cast for each party. For example, if a party gained 40% of the total votes, a perfectly proportional system would allow them to gain 40% of the seats.""This differs from the first past the post system, as set out above, in that a relatively high vote share rarely corresponds with increased seats for the smaller parties. In 2019, for example, the Lib Dems won 11.5% of the vote but only 1.7% – 11 – of the 650 seats.Unsurprisingly, both Reform UK and the Lib Dems support proportional representation.The Lib Dems this week made it part of their manifesto, with the party saying it would introduce the single transferrable vote method, a form of proportional representation which allows electors to rank their preference of candidates on the ballot.The party previously sought to change the UK’s voting system while in the coalition government under then-leader Nick Clegg, but voters rejected the plan in a 2011 referendum.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

Yahoo News UK,The Tory ministers and 'big beasts' who could lose MP seats in the electionSeveral big names in the Conservative Party are at risk of losing their seats in the general election.,"['Grant Shapps', 'Penny Mordaunt', 'Liz Truss', 'Jacob Rees-Mogg', 'Johnny Mercer', 'Victoria Prentis', 'Alex Chalk', 'David TC Davies']",Andy Wells,Updated 20 June 2024 at 3:51 am·5-min read,20,June,2024,03:51:00,5,"Rishi Sunak could become the first prime minister to lose his seat in a general election, according to new bombshell polling.According to the Savanta poll, which was commissioned by The Telegraph, the Conservatives are projected to win just 53 seats in the general election. Some three-quarters of the Cabinet would lose their seats in that scenario – including Sunak.Were Sunak to lose his seat in Richmond (Yorks), it would make him the first prime minister in history to lose their seat in a general election, according to the Institute for Government. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is also facing a battle to hold on to his constituency, with the vote on a “knife edge”.Savanta spoke to around 18,000 people between 7 June and 18 June for their poll. If reflected in the election, Labour would be on course to win 516 seats, with a commanding Commons majority of 382. The Liberal Democrats would have nearly as many seats (50) as the Tories.Jeremy Hunt: My constituency is on a knife edgeHunt could be among the Conservative casualties on the night of the 4 July poll, despite his newly-created seat in Godalming and Ash currently holding a Conservative majority of more than 10,000. He is facing a battle to win the seat in Surrey, with the Liberal Democrats keen on taking a high-profile scalp.Several other Tory ‘big beasts’ also face a tight vote to hold onto their seat, according to a major poll by Ipsos.Grant ShappsDefence secretary Grant Shapps may lose his seat in the election. (Getty)Defence secretary Grant Shapps, who had been touted as a potential leader of the Conservatives after the election, is at risk of losing his Welwyn Hatfield seat, according to Ipsos. Their polling suggests a likely Labour victory, with Sir Keir Starmer’s party currently on 48%, compared to 28% for the Conservatives.Shapps won the seat in the 2019 election with a vote share of 52.6%, increasing his majority from the previous election.Penny MordauntPenny Mordaunt’s seat is at risk from Labour. (PA)Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons, is another Tory MP whose name has been mentioned in a future leadership contest – in the event of the Tories losing the election. However, she may not even be an MP after 4 July as her Portsmouth North seat is at risk.Seen as “leaning Labour”, polling suggests Labour are on 42%, compared to the Tories on 34%. She won 61.4% of the vote in the 2019 election.Liz TrussFormer prime minister Liz Truss may not be an MP after the election. (PA)Former prime minister Liz Truss is at risk in her South West Norfolk seat. The seat is seen as a “toss up”, with Truss currently in the lead at 31%. Labour are a sitting at 27% but Reform UK are polling 30%.Allowing for margins of error and another two weeks of campaigning, the seat will be hotly contested between all three parties on 4 July.Jacob Rees-MoggJacob Rees-Mogg is on track to lose his seat at the general election. (PA)While no longer a government minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg losing his North East Somerset and Hanham seat would perhaps be one of the night’s bigger surprises. Rees-Mogg has been an outspoken critic of some of Sunak’s policies and is a regular presenter on GB News.However, the Ipsos poll has the seat, which has been newly-created for the 2024 election, is currently showing a “likely Labour” win, with the party on 47%, compared to 30% for the Conservatives.Johnny MercerPolling suggests Johnny Mercer will lose his seat to Labour at the election. (PA)Veterans’ affairs secretary Johnny Mercer is standing for the Plymouth Moor View seat, having last won the seat in 2019 with an increased vote share of 60.7%. However, a “likely” Labour win is expected, with a projected vote share of 49% on 4 July. The Tories are currently polling at 30% – half of what they won in 2019.Victoria PrentisAttorney general Victoria Prentis is currently facing being replaced by Labour in the election. (PA)A “likely” Labour victory is predicted for Banbury, a seat currently held by attorney general Victoria Prentis. The Tories are polling at 30% in the constituency, compared to 40% for Labour. Prentis is notable for being the first British MP to take a Ukrainian refugee in her house following Russia’s invasion.Alex ChalkThe Libreal Democrats are projected to take over justice secretary Alex Chalk’s seat.

The Guardian,"Starmer’s growth plan ‘doomed’ without access to EU markets, warn economists",[],Toby Helm and Phillip Inman,22 June 2024 at 11:00 am·5-min read,22,June,2024,11:00:00,5,"A Labour government under Keir Starmer will fail to maximise the UK’s economic growth unless it takes the country back into the European Union’s single market and customs union, leading economists and diplomats have said.The warnings come as an Opinium poll for the Observer finds that 56% of voters now believe Brexit has been bad for the UK economy as a whole, compared with just 12% who believe it has been economically beneficial.Some 62% of people questioned also believe Brexit has contributed to higher prices in shops, against 8% who think that it has had the opposite effect.With less than two weeks to go until polling day Labour has increased its overall lead to 20 points over the Conservatives and is firmly on course for a large Commons majority.Related: Reopening Brexit debate would bring ‘turmoil’, says Keir StarmerBut there is increasing pressure on Starmer and the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to spell out how they plan to deliver on their manifesto pledge of securing the highest sustained economic growth of any G7 country while keeping within tight fiscal rules, and while post-Brexit barriers to trade remain in place between the UK and EU.The Office for Budget Responsibility says UK GDP will be around 4% lower every year than it would have been had we remained inside the EU.Starmer insisted while campaigning in south London that On Saturday he would not rejoin the bloc either in the short or longer term. “We are not rejoining the EU, we are not rejoining the single market or the customs union,” the Labour leader said.Asked if he would ever reconsider this, he added: “No. It isn’t our plan, it never has been. I’ve never said that as leader of the Labour party and it is not in our manifesto.”While EU leaders are said to be determined not to allow a Starmer government to “cherry pick” its way to a preferential economic relationship without paying into the EU budget and accepting freedom of movement, Starmer said he still believed he could “get a better deal with the EU, and if we are elected to government that is what we will endeavour to do”.Economists are clear, however, that without access to the single market, which allows goods to cross into the EU without extra costs and paperwork, and vice versa, the UK’s economic progress will be seriously impeded.Dimitri Zenghelis, an economist and Brexit expert at the London School of Economics (LSE), said extra barriers since 2020 had cut trade with the EU and stifled investment.He said Labour’s plans to talk to Brussels in a less combative way would “change the mood music for foreign investors”, but that only by rejoining the single market and customs union “could the UK shift the dial in a meaningful way”.A report last week by the LSE found that the trade and cooperation agreement signed on 30 December 2020 by then prime minister Boris Johnson had “reduced exports to the EU by around 30% for small firms” and “perhaps around 20,000 small firms have stopped exporting goods to the EU entirely”.It warned the next government that any trade deals with countries outside the EU would make little impact on trade flows.Prof Stephen Millard of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, who worked for 26 years at the Bank of England, said it was clear that single market membership would boost trade and competition. “The closer we are able to get to where we were [as full members of the EU] then the higher growth we will get out of it. We could certainly enjoy higher growth if we were to have a closer relationship with Europe.”Former EU permanent representative to Brussels Kim Darroch described Brexit as an act of economic “self-harm” while another very senior EU diplomat said: “We used to be a far more effective trading nation than we are now. The cause of that is Brexit. There is no getting away from that.”Opinium found that a total of 56% of voters now want a closer relationship with the EU, with 32% wanting to completely rejoin the bloc.With Brexit more of an issue in the election north of the border, the SNP yesterday highlighted comments by Tory candidate for Aberdeen South, John Wheeler, who said at a hustings that Brexit “is not working for multiple businesses across Aberdeen and the north east”.Writing in the Observer Labour’s national campaign co-ordinator Pat McFadden cautioned against the idea that the party has a massive election victory in the bag.Although the Tories are in ever increasing despair on the campaign trail, after recent revelations about senior figures putting bets on a 4 July election before it was called by Rishi Sunak, McFadden says the result is anything but decided.Clearly worried that complacency will set in he writes: “It is one thing for polls to take a snapshot of public opinion. It’s another entirely for them to influence voting behaviour. Particularly when it is reinforced by a cynical voter suppression strategy from the Tory party telling people the outcome is known so they don’t have to bother to vote.“No way is this election a done deal. The headlines about the clutch of MRP polls disguise a huge level of uncertainty.“ Up to 20% of voters taking part in these polls say they have yet to make their minds up or are uncertain how to vote. This could easily be 4-5,000 people per constituency. No wonder one poll said there are 175 seats which are too close to call.”"
Yahoo News UK,"3 electoral maps that show how disastrous the election could be for the ToriesWith new modelling predicting a Labour victory even bigger than Tony Blair's 1997 landslide, the outlook for Rishi Sunak is not looking good.",['Which Tory ministers are at risk of losing their seats?'],James Cheng-Morris and  James Hockaday,Updated 5 June 2024 at 8:34 am·4-min read,5,June,2024,08:34:00,4,"The outlook was already looking bleak for the Conservative Party when Rishi Sunak called the general election following months of dismal approval ratings that showed little sign of improving.At a campaign event last week, Sunak said he didn't think defeat to Labour was a ""foregone conclusion"", suggesting his main election rival Sir Keir Starmer was taking the British electorate ""for granted"".However, a general election projection released on Monday will have added to the Tories' woes – predicting the biggest win for Labour in the party's history, surpassing even that of Tony Blair's 1997 landslide.The analysis, carried out by YouGov for Sky News, used a relatively new polling technique called Multi-level Regression and Post-stratification (MRP), which is regarded to have had a good track record and can provide detailed predictions at a constituency level basis. The scale of Sunak's problems is demonstrated by the interactive maps below, showing just how much ground the Tories are expected to lose compared to their 2019 victory.Click on the arrows in the top left to switch between the two maps. Check your own constituency to see if it is projected to change handsThe first map above shows the seats won in the 2019 general election, when Boris Johnson led the party to a stunning majority.The wall of Tory blue on the map, compared to the spots of Labour red, is a demonstration of just how far Labour, then led by Jeremy Corbyn, had fallen in public standing. The result was Labour's worst electoral performance since 1935.If you toggle to the second map, the projection by YouGov (which was based on polling carried out between 24 May - 1 June) suggests that Starmer's party is on track to win 422 seats, with the Tories down to just 140.Such a result would be the Conservative Party's worst performance at a general election since 1906. If YouGov's predictions are accurate, Labour winning a 194-seat majority would be the highest number since Conservative Stanley Baldwin won a majority of 208 in 1924.The model suggests the Conservatives could be set for near wipeout across many areas of the country, including London, the North East, the North West, and Wales.It also projects that the Scottish National Party would lose more than half their seats, with Labour returning as the largest party north of the border, and the Liberal Democrats reclaiming its place as the third party of British politics – winning 48 seats.The new figures, released yesterday, came as Reform UK co-founder Nigel Farage announced that he would be returning as the populist party's leader and would stand for election in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. Even before Farage's latest bid, pollsters told Yahoo News that Reform UK could pose a serious threat to the Tories by splitting the vote and potentially handing even more seats to Labour.The YouGov projection follows a similar poll by modelling site Electoral Calculus, which came out on 31 May. The polling also compares the 2019 result with Electoral Calculus' projection.It predicts that Labour is on course to win an even bigger majority of 319 seats - with Starmer's party picking up 485 MPs and the Tories way behind with 66. The modelling shows the Lib Dems getting very close to the Conservative Party, with 59 seats.While Electoral Calculus' polling, based on opinion polls from 8 May to 20 May, returns a different set of projections to YouGov's, both clearly indicate the scale of the problem facing Sunak.The Electoral Calculus model has predicted Sir Keir Starmer's Labour will win a massive majority.

That was damaging at the time of partygate and is damaging here.”Four figures with links to Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, are being looked into by the Gambling Commission, amid allegations they used insider knowledge to bet on a July election before it was announced.'If these allegations are true, it's very difficult to defend,' Michael Gove has said - Leon Neal/GettyMr Gove said: “You are, in effect, securing an advantage against other people who are betting entirely fairly and without that knowledge. So if these allegations are true, it’s very difficult to defend.”But friends of a parliamentary candidate have claimed the commission has risked Tory reputations by going “rogue” in the election betting inquiry.The commission is understood to be working through a list of names provided by bookmakers of people who made £200 or more betting on a July general election in the three weeks before it was made public.Craig Williams, a senior aide to Mr Sunak who is also an MP candidate, is being investigated by the Gambling Commission after reporting betting £100 on the election date just before it was called.He has apologised for having a “flutter” on the election.Craig Williams apologised for a reported £100 'flutter' on a July election date - UK Parliament/PATony Lee, the Conservative Party director of campaigning, and Laura Saunders, his wife and a Tory candidate, are also both understood to be under investigation by the commission.Both Mr Williams and Ms Saunders remain Tory candidates for the election.It was reported on Saturday night that Nick Mason, the Conservative Party chief data officer, had also been told that he was part of the inquiry.The Conservative Party confirmed to The Sunday Telegraph that Mr Mason had taken a leave of absence.A police officer working in Mr Sunak’s close protection team has also been arrested as part of a separate investigation into bets placed on the timing of the election.A friend of Ms Saunders told The Telegraph that the Gambling Commission had gone “rogue”.They said that by confirming investigations are under way, but without giving any further detail, it leads to individuals’ reputations being unfairly tarnished.“The commission should be saying at least when the bet was made. It might be something Laura had no influence over – like betting a fiver on a Tory majority six months ago.”The ally went on to say that it is highly unlikely that Mr Lee would have known that Mr Sunak was planning to call a summer election.They added: “Tony [Lee] has been totally cut out – Downing Street runs everything. He has an impressive sounding title but he wouldn’t have known about the snap election.”In a statement, Ms Saunders’ solicitor said that she would be cooperating with the watchdog’s investigation.The statement added: “It is inappropriate to conduct any investigation of this kind via the media, and doing so risks jeopardising the work of the Gambling Commission and the integrity of its investigation.”A Conservative Party spokesman said: “We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals.“As the commission is an independent body, it wouldn’t be proper to comment further until any process is concluded.”A commission spokesman said: “The Gambling Commission regulates gambling in the interests of consumers and the wider public.“Currently, the commission is investigating the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election.“This is an ongoing investigation and the commission cannot provide any further details at this time.“We are not confirming or denying the identity of any individuals involved in this investigation.”"

The Independent,The great election turn-off: the true scale of millennials and Gen Z who won’t vote,[],David Maddox and Alicja Hagopian,22 June 2024 at 11:34 am·5-min read,22,June,2024,11:34:00,5,"Huge numbers of younger people feel disenfranchised by the political parties and are not going to vote, exclusive polling for The Independent shows.According to research carried out by Techne UK, around four in 10 people – 41 per cent – aged 18 to 34 have either not registered to vote (24 per cent) or are registered but have decided not to go to the ballot box (17 per cent) next month.Leading pollster Lord Hayward described the figure as “very high” for this stage of an election.He told The Independent: “That is what we would expect for a normal turnout in terms of people not voting. But you have to remember that among the 59 per cent who say they will vote a sizeable number of them will also not vote.”Leading pollster Lord Hayward described the figure as ‘very high’ for this stage of an election (PA Wire)The shocking new figures – the highest for any age group measured – reveal a democratic deficit with Generation Z and millennials in British politics that has left the parties not addressing the issues concerning younger voters.In particular the desire to reverse Brexit – while supported by all age groups by 43 per cent to 40 per cent (52 per cent to 48 per cent excluding don’t knows) – is most strongly backed by 18- to 34-year-olds.Among this group, support for rejoin is 46 per cent to 30 per cent (61 per cent to 39 per cent excluding don’t knows) but Brexit has been a taboo subject in the election.Earlier this week, figures from the Electoral Commission showed registration rates among under-25s were half that of the 2019 election period, while wider apathy threatens the overall turnout.Lord Hayward said: “The problem is that 18- to 34-year-olds do not identify with any of the political parties or are particularly taken by the agenda. Another poll the other day by Savanta showed how young voters are abandoning the Labour Party.”Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are turning off younger voters (Getty/Reuters)Dan Lawes, head of partnerships at voter registration group My Life My Say, which ran the “give an X campaign” to boost voter registration, said the findings were “stark, yet not surprising”.He told The Independent: “Trust in political parties and leaders amongst younger generations is incredibly low, heightened by years of scandals and crises.”He said there was a surge in voter registration among 18- to 34-year-olds on last week’s deadline, with 355,548 submitting applications.“Our message to young people is clear – you’re the expert in your own lived experiences, don’t let others make important decisions about your future,” he added.Early in the campaign, former deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine warned that this would be “one of the most dishonest” election campaigns in history because of the refusal to debate Brexit by the main parties.But other issues affecting younger voters have also been forced to take a back seat compared to those which play more strongly with older voters, such as immigration and pensions.Hopes by party leaders that the set piece events could make an impact on younger voters are also knocked down by the findings, which show that among Generation Z and millennials only 30 per cent could be swayed by the TV debates. This compares to an average across all age groups of 40 per cent and 51 per cent among pensioners.There has been little discussion or prioritisation of housing even though the ability to buy your own home is out of reach for the vast majority of younger voters.Added to the renters’ reform bill which was shelved because of the early election, so-called “generation rent” has been left without protections against no-fault evictions and rent rises.Neither of the main parties is willing to look at the cost of tuition fees on students and long-term debt implications, with Labour even U-turning on a promise to scrap them.The figures come after both Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and prime minister Rishi Sunak were directly challenged in the BBC Question Time sessions on Thursday by younger voters, who did not feel their issues were being prioritised.Sir Keir was quizzed by a student on his many U-turns, including on the promise to get rid of tuition fees.He admitted the fees are “very expensive for students, don’t work well, students come out with a huge debt around their neck”.And he acknowledged that five years ago he said he would get rid of them but insisted: “I had a choice to make.”He said it was a choice between bringing waiting lists in the NHS down or scrapping tuition fees.Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak were both grilled by young voters (Stefan Rousseau/PA)Meanwhile, Mr Sunak appeared out of touch when he was asked by a student for one policy which would help someone who is too old for national service and does not plan to buy a house in the next five years.The prime minister replied: “When you get a job, I will cut your tax.”Mr Sunak’s national service plan for school leavers to join the military or do community service has not gone down well with younger voters and in the Question Time session he suggested sanctions would be applied to those who did not do it, including not being able to access bank accounts or driving licences.A tetchy prime minister was also seen lecturing a younger member of the audience over her question on the European Convention of Human Rights before she accused him of “putting words in my mouth”.The parties claim they do have an offer for younger voters with the Tories pointing to their help-to-buy scheme.But the Conservatives’ biggest offer is to pensioners to increase the pension triple lock to a pension triple lock plus, with extra protections against tax.Labour plans to give 16-year-olds the vote and has policies to bring in rent reform, but none of Labour’s six first steps or Mr Sunak’s five priorities directly tackle issues for young voters."
The Independent,Labour to target embattled Sunak over ‘dirty dozen’ Tory candidates,[],David Maddox,22 June 2024 at 2:09 pm·6-min read,22,June,2024,02:09:00,6,"Labour are set to launch a social media campaign aimed at questioning Rishi Sunak’s judgement by ramping up pressure for him to suspend 12 candidates caught up in different controversies including the betting scandal.The new campaign will feature an unnamed cabinet minister who allegedly put a bet on the election date, and 11 named Tory candidates involved in a range of issues highlighted in the campaign.On Saturday night it emerged that the Tory chief data officer, Nick Mason, was also being investigated for alleged betting, according to the PA news agency. He’s taken a leave of absence.With Labour more than 20 points ahead in most polls currently, Labour want to go for the jugular over Mr Sunak’s decision not to suspend candidates from his party.Labour are targeting Rishi Sunak over controversies surrounding these 12 candidates (Labour Party)Shadow paymaster general Jonathan Ashworth described the prime minister as “weak” for not being able to take a firm stance. The other 11 so-called “dirty dozen” include:Craig Williams, Mr Sunak’s parliamentary private secretary standing in Montgomeryshire, and Laura Saunders, who has worked for the Tories since 2015, married to director of campaigning Tony Lee, and standing in Bristol North West, who are both being investigated by the Gambling Commission for betting on the election date shortly before it was called.Ms Saunders has not responded, but Mr Williams said: “I clearly made a huge error of judgement that’s for sure and I apologise.”Mr Sunak said he was “extremely angry” about the scandal but insisted he cannot suspend people while the investigation is underway warning those found guilty will be expelled from the Tories.Marco Longhi, standing in Dudley, is accused of stoking ethnic divisions with a letter addressed to “voters of the British Pakistani/ Kashmiri community” asking who they thought would speak up for Kashmir, him or Labour rival Sonia Kumar, with her common Indian surname in bold, underlined, capital letters.Rishi Sunak is under pressure in the closing stages of the campaign (AP)Mr Longhi denied stoking ethnic tensions, saying: “I don’t know what her ethnicity or religious background is. I am not trying to stoke division. I will always stand up for abuses of human rights wherever they take place.”Stephen James, Dover and Deal, is accused of using AI to produce an antisemitic cartoon depicting men with hooked noses at the white cliffs of Dover carrying bags of “false hopes”, then using it in a now-deleted social media post attacking so-called “carpetbaggers” standing in the seat.Mr James has “unequivocally apologised” and said that the image had been created from famous historic cartoons by Thomas Nast and Gerald Scarfe.He said: “As someone who has written for The Times of Israel on antisemitism, I am acutely aware of the importance of vigilance against such instances. AI has safeguards to prevent the creation of offensive images, but on this occasion, it fell short and I shall be extra vigilant going forward. I apologise wholeheartedly for any offence caused by this image.”Rose Hulse (centre) is one of the candidates being scrutinised (@BSGMatters/X)Rose Hulse, Bristol North East, standing against Jewish Labour candidate Damien Egan, liked posts on social media referring to Mr Egan as a “fiend of Israel”, and another that accused Labour leader Keir Starmer of “tap dancing” to the idea that “AntiSemitismIsAllThatMatters”.Ms Hulse told The Independent: “The tweet referenced was clicked in error. As soon as I realised, I immediately deselected the tweet. I apologise for any offence caused.”Darren Millar, Clwyd North, was filmed bowing before an alleged Islamophobic hate preacher while he delivered a sermon at the launch of a bible centre in Wales, and has been revealed to have links with another pastor accused of homophobia.Mr Millar told the BBC he did not endorse the views of the pastors adding: “No one should be discriminated against on the basis of their sexual orientation or religious beliefs.”Lee Roberts, Putney, described London mayor Sadiq Khan as a “snivelling little drip” who had done more to damage the capital “than the Luftwaffe”.After the recording came to light, Mr Roberts said: “I would like to apologise for my comments. They were not intended to give any offence.”Shadow paymaster general Jonathan Ashworth says Sunak is “weak” (Victoria Jones/PA)Oliver Johnstone, Stockport, has joked about drugging women with the date rape drug Rohypnol in order to have sex.Mr Johnstone said: “These comments were made a number of years ago and I wholeheartedly apologise for them.”Alex Deane, Finchley and Golders Green, defended Boris Johnson against a groping allegation by quoting the phrase: “How do I know my advances are unwanted until I’ve made them.”Mr Deane has pointed out that he was quoting the late Tory MP Alan Clarke from his diaries and his full quote was about the presumption of innocence in British law when his fellow guest on Sky News at the time had said she believed Johnson to be guilty.Will Goodhand, West Bromwich, was filmed 19 years ago in a dating show boasting about his massage technique, and asking a retail assistant her bra size.Mr Goodhand said: “This was a dating show of its time. It’s not something that I would do or take part in now.”Ashley Fox, Bridgwater, is accused of lying to MPs about his political ambitions when they vetted his candidacy to head up the Independent Monitoring Authority. He told the justice select committee he would not run for political office if appointed.Fox said: “I have now stepped down from the IMA. I am very proud to have been selected as the Conservative candidate for Bridgwater and am looking forward to the election on 4 July.”Commenting for Labour, Mr Ashworth said: “While Labour took immediate action this week to suspend the one candidate for our party against whom serious allegations have been made, Rishi Sunak has refused to take any action against the ‘dirty dozen’ of Tory candidates, who stand accused of acts ranging from blatant corruption to dog-whistle racism.“This is not just about Rishi Sunak’s weak leadership, it is about his basic lack of backbone and principle. If any Labour candidate had done any of the things these 12 Tories have been accused of, Keir Starmer would have had them out the door before their feet could touch the ground.”A Conservative Party spokesman said: “The Conservative Party has spoken to these individuals, and reminded them of the Party’s code of conduct and standards expected of candidates, including on social media.”"
Yahoo News UK,Who will win the next general election?

All the polls use the multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP) technique, which enables projections to be made at constituency level.And while all three polls indicate Sunak faces an uphill battle to avoid a major defeat, there is a significant disparity from all three as to how far ahead Keir Starmer actually is.Yahoo summaries the key points of the three pollsTories to slump to lowest number of seats since party's formationYouGov's polling for Sky News projects Labour is on course to achieve a 200-seat majority. Labour is predicted to secure 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.This projection would show the Tories plummeting from the 365 won by Boris Johnson in the 2019 election and give the party their lowest ever number of MPs. It would also give Starmer more seats than the 418 won by Tony Blair in 1997.

This polling puts Labour on a massive 516 seats, with the Tories on only 53 - just in front of the Lib Dems on 50 - a forecast that would be remarkable were it to be reflected on polling night.

Given the nature of these seat totals, it is natural to be slightly sceptical.""It adds: ""Not every MRP is the same. The statistical 'building blocks' used to model voter behaviour will vary from pollster to pollster, which will in turn lead to different vote shares and seat totals. All different pollsters will get different national vote share.""The MRP methodology, as described by YouGov, ""uses data at the constituency level to predict the outcomes of seats based on the concentration of various different types of voters who live there"".Stuart Wilks-Heeg, writing in The Conversation earlier this month, points out some of the other limitations of MRP polling: ""There are ... factors MRPs cannot take into account. Some constituency results will be influenced by locally specific issues that statistical models can’t capture. For example, adjustments cannot be made for who the candidates are in each constituency and whether any have a profile that could enhance, or detract from, their party’s chance of winning. Think Nigel Farage standing for Reform UK in Clacton.""And competing MRPs produce contrasting outcomes because each model uses specific assumptions and data. Different inputs produce different outputs. This election has seen more MRPs produced than ever before, and from various organisations. In the early hours of July 5, we’ll know which one came closest to getting the result correct.""What are the latest odds?As of 19 June, Oddschecker – a website which compares odds across different bookmakers – had Labour at 1/41 to win the most seats. To put that in context, this is seen as so likely that a £10 bet would return just £10.24.The Conservatives are 40/1 to win the most seats, a scenario seen as so unlikely that a £10 punt would return £410.What went wrong for the Tories?YouGov's voting intention tracker between January 2020 and June 2024. (YouGov)So, why have the polls changed so dramatically? It's worth looking back on an extremely eventful four-and-a-half years in UK politics.According to YouGov's voting intention tracker (see chart, above), Tory support peaked at 53%, with Labour on 32%, in April 2020, months after the party's stunning success in the 2019 general election and Boris Johnson's pledge to “get Brexit done”. That month also saw Starmer take over as Labour leader from Jeremy Corbyn.This was also amid a spirit of national unity following the onset of the COVID pandemic which nearly killed Johnson himself. The then-PM had been released from hospital five days before this particular survey was taken.Boris Johnson delivers his final speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street in September 2022. (AFP via Getty Images)Over the rest of the year, there was a downturn in support amid chaos over COVID rules, with the Tories falling as low as 35% in November 2020, compared to Labour on 40%.However, the UK’s successful COVID vaccination programme provided a pathway out of lockdown and with it, improved poll ratings. Tory support peaked at 41% in June 2021, with Labour at 30%.In October that year, there was a sense Johnson was untouchable. At the Tory party conference, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg remarked how the PM was ""in total command of his party, and politically dominant in the country"".But this fell apart quickly with the Partygate scandal, which emerged in November that year. Time and again, reports emerged of government and Tory staff – including Johnson – having taken part in lockdown-era social gatherings when their own COVID rules had prohibited them.By January 2022, Tory support had plummeted to 28%, with Labour on 38%. Johnson struggled on, but never recovered and a wave of ministerial resignations forced him to resign in July that year.The UK had three separate prime ministers – Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak – between 6 September and 24 October, 2022. (Getty Images)His successor, Liz Truss, then embarked on arguably the most disastrous prime ministerial reign in history, characterised by the catastrophic ""mini-budget"", containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, which prompted an economic crisis. Like Johnson, she lost the confidence of Tory MPs – and voters – and had to resign.Her 49-day spell as PM was the shortest in history, with Tory support plummeting to 19% (with Labour on 56%) the day after she announced her resignation in October 2022.Rishi Sunak, who had lost to Truss in the previous month's Tory leadership election, took over. However, as the above YouGov chart indicates, he has failed to cut through with voters. Tory support was at 23% two days after he assumed office, with the most recent survey, carried out on Thursday, showing support is now lower than under Truss at 18%.In short, the polls and odds, not to mention other factors such as notable by-election victories for Starmer's Labour, are pointing to a Labour government next month.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

The polls have consistently painted a very bleak picture for the prime minister, with Labour holding on to a double-digit poll lead over his Conservatives.Recent by-election results suggest that Labour is likely to win a landslide victory – but there’s still time for the PM to turn it around.Here’s everything you need to know about Sunak and what’s he’s saying about the biggest issues in British politics right now.Early lifeSunak was born in Southampton in 1980, the eldest of three children. His Indian parents both arrived from East Africa in the 1960s. A football-mad boy whose childhood idol was Matt Le Tissier, Sunak was described by the family’s neighbours as a child with “lovely manners”.In his youngest years, the PM attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. According to a recent biography, fellow pupil Ollie Case said: “He was someone that was talked about. The teachers would say: ‘He’s going to be prime minister'.""But, growing up in the 1980s and 90s, he also remembers experiencing racism. “My mother was obsessed with us not having accents,” Sunak has said.Rishi Sunak was football-mad as a boy growing up in Southampton. (ITV)Sunak's familySunak is married to Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian entrepreneur and multi-billionaire. The pair first met in 2004 at Stanford University, his future wife apparently attracted to his “honesty and integrity”.Five years later they married in a two-day Indian wedding held in Bangalore. The couple have two daughters, Krishna and Anoushka, who will turn 13 and 11 this year, both of whom are largely kept out of the public eye.Sunak attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. (Rishi Sunak, Instagram)His parentsYashvir Sunak, Rishi’s father, was born in Kenya. He arrived in the UK to study medicine and then stayed, becoming an NHS GP. His mother, Usha, was born in Tanzania and is a pharmacist.The couple met in Britain and settled in Southampton in the 1970s. Usha is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.His educationAs a teenager Sunak studied at Winchester College where he was, he says, a self-confessed “geek”. According to a recent biography, the “naughtiest” thing the prime minister did during his school days “was to smuggle a hand-held television into the school so that he did not miss any key games of Euro 96”.The childhood home of Rishi Sunak in Southampton. (Getty Images, photo taken in 2022)Perhaps unsurprisingly for someone with such an unblemished record, he went on to become the school’s head boy. Sunak worked while studying, delivering medicines for his mother’s pharmacy and as a waiter at a local Indian restaurant.After school, Sunk read philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, graduating in 2001 with a first class degree. While still at university he held an internship at the Conservative Party campaign headquarters and joined the party, but went on studying before entering politics.He earned his MBA from Stanford in 2006 as a Fulbright Scholar, meaning he was selected among the most promising candidates from the UK.How much is he worth?As prime minister, Rishi Sunak earns £80,807 on top of a salary of £84,144 for being an MP. But his current income from Westminster pales in comparison to his family’s vast wealth through marriage.The Sunday Times valued the couple’s joint fortune at £730m. Murty's father is the co-founder of Infosys, an Indian tech conglomerate, in which she holds shares estimated at around £430m. Her family is also involved in a £900m business arrangement with Amazon in India, and she is a shareholder of multiple other companies.Rishi Sunak's mother is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.Before entering politics Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and a series of hedge funds. He is also known to have invested in blind trusts, in which investments are made without holders knowing where the funds are located. These arrangements reportedly hold Sunak’s own multi-million-pound fortune.His religionSunak is not only the first prime minister of colour and of Indian heritage but he is also the first practising Hindu to hold the biggest job in UK politics.He has spoken of his pride in his Hindu faith, saying, “that’s how I was raised, and that’s how I am”. He said: “Having faith gives you resilience, gives you strength that is important and it provides an outlook on life which I find particularly valuable.”Sunak on... the NHSThe prime minister’s biggest challenge in office has been the crisis in the NHS - and to many people in the sector his government has been found wanting. “We have not made enough progress,” Sunak said when asked about his commitment to cut NHS waiting lists during an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV. Asked if that meant he had failed, the prime minister replied: “Yes, we have.""Sunak expects to see waiting lists start to reduce this spring, and blames the delays on “industrial action”, as disputes with junior doctors and consultants over pay and conditions continue. Yet Sunak himself has been blamed for holding up a deal that would prevent more walkouts.Sunak, his wife Akshata and daughters Anoushka and Krishna (second left) at Santa Monica Pier, California, on their summer holiday in 2023. (AP)Sunak on… immigrationAccording to the prime minister, illegal migration threatens to “overwhelm” Europe. In June 2023 he claimed his plan to “stop the boats” and tackle illegal immigration was working, but by August 2023 he had changed his mind: “It’s not an easy problem to fix,” he told broadcasters. “I never said we would be able to solve it overnight.”He has staked much of his reputation on the government's Rwanda Bill - his plan to deport asylum seekers to the east African country that finally became law last month, after months of legal and procedural challenges. It has paved the way for deportation flights to get off the ground within weeks.He described his policy, which he says will act as a deterrent to people traffickers, as being “the will of the people” – yet polling suggests low support for such a punitive approach.The policy, coupled with Conservative talk of limits on legal migration, shows that the government is committed to taking a hard line on the issue, despite the risk of alienating more moderate voters.The Rwanda policy is not universally popular. (YouGov)Sunak on... the cost of living crisisThe prime minister has told hard-pressed working families that they will feel some relief from the cost of living crisis as inflation continues to drop following its highs of October 2022. He described the government’s tax cuts as “meaningful” and has welcomed the dip in mortgage rates at the turn of the year.Sunak says falling inflation will have the biggest impact on family budgets “and will start to ease some of those pressures” and that he was right to focus on that figure. However, the global drop in energy prices is probably the biggest factor in easing the hit on wallets - something that the prime minister has no control over.However, the fall in inflation to 2.3% on 22 May this year – the lowest it has been in nearly three years – was likely one of the key factors in persuading Sunak to call a snap election many weeks earlier than experts had predicted.Can we expect more handouts or tax breaks to help balance family budgets? Not according to Sunak, who has warned voters that it’s time to “move on” from government support.Sunak on... pensionsThe triple-lock pensions policy is a tricky one for Sunak – especially since Labour has committed to retaining the policy. Any change to a policy that has become a hallmark of recent Conservative governments would not go down well with the 12 million pensioners it would likely impact – many of whom are lifelong Tory voters.Last November, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said pensions should start being pegged to an average of inflation and wage growth, which would help reduce state spending over time.Sunak’s response to that was ambiguous to say the least: “We are the government that has … delivered the triple lock and it is why, right now, pensions are, depending on how you look at it, £800 or £900 bigger than they otherwise would have been.” He is yet to confirm whether it will appear in the manifesto."
PA Media: UK News,Tory data chief takes leave of absence amid General Election betting claims,[],"David Lynch, PA Political Staff",23 June 2024 at 3:11 am·3-min read,23,June,2024,03:11:00,3,"The Conservative Party’s chief data officer has taken a leave of absence amid claims he placed bets on the timing of the General Election.The PA news agency understands that Nick Mason has taken a leave of absence after becoming the latest Tory to be investigated by the Gambling Commission for allegedly betting on the timing of the election before the date had been announced.The latest allegations were published by The Sunday Times, which claimed dozens of bets had been placed with potential winnings worth thousands of pounds.The revelations are a fresh blow to Rishi Sunak’s hopes of getting the Tory election campaign on track after three other Conservative figures were caught up in the scandal.Tony Lee, the party’s director of campaigns, and his wife Laura Saunders, are under investigation by the Commission.Ms Saunders, a Conservative candidate in the Bristol North West constituency, has said she will co-operate fully with the investigation.Craig Williams, who was the Prime Minister’s parliamentary private secretary and is the Conservative candidate for Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr, has admitted to putting “a flutter” on the date of the election and is also facing a probe.Michael Gove, the Housing Secretary, has condemned the latest reports, and likened the controversy to Partygate.Minister for Levelling Up, Housing, and Communities Michael Gove (Aaron Chown/PA)“It looks like one rule for them and one rule for us,” he told the Sunday Times, adding: “That’s the most potentially damaging thing.”Mr Gove went on to suggest it was “just not acceptable” for those in a “privileged position” close to the Prime Minister to use what he described as “inside information to make additional money for yourself”.He added: “You are, in effect, securing an advantage against other people who are betting entirely fairly and without that knowledge. So if these allegations are true, it’s very difficult to defend.”A Labour spokesperson described the latest allegations as “utterly extraordinary” and called for Mr Sunak to suspend those implicated in the betting scandal.The Liberal Democrats meanwhile called on Mr Sunak to personally intervene, with a Cabinet Office inquiry into the reports.Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: “This is now an all-out scandal at the heart of Rishi Sunak’s Conservative Party.Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the matter was an ‘all-out scandal’ (Will Durrant/PA)“Sunak must personally intervene to order a Cabinet Office inquiry and suspend all those under investigation by the Gambling Commission.“People are sick and tired of this sleaze. Day by day, hour by hour, the Conservative Government mire themselves in more of it.”A Conservative spokesman said: “As instructed by the Gambling Commission, we are not permitted to discuss any matters related to any investigation with the subject or any other persons.”The revelations come as the opinion polls continue to suggest poor public support for the Conservative party.In the latest Savanta poll published for the Sunday Telegraph, Labour are on 42% of the vote, and the Conservatives are on 19%, their lowest ever vote share in a test of public opinion by the company.Nigel Farage’s Reform UK meanwhile are on 16% of the vote, in a poll of 2,103 UK adults conducted between June 19 and 21.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage faced criticism over comments on the war in Ukraine (Joe Giddens/PA)The Reform leader faced criticism from both Mr Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer for his remarks in a BBC Panorama interview that the West “provoked” Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.He refused to apologise for the comments, writing in the Sunday Telegraph that he was “not and never have been an apologist or supporter of Putin”.Mr Farage added: “Nobody can fairly accuse me of being an appeaser. I have never sought to justify Putin’s invasion in any way and I’m not now.”"

The term is also sometimes used to refer to the election itself, as in ‘they could not win at the ballot box’.CampaignThe time before an election in which politicians persuade people to vote for them. In the case of the 2024 election in the UK, parliament was dissolved on the 30 May and the election will take place on 4 July.CanvassingGoing round a particular area trying to persuade people to vote for one party or the other.In UK elections, this is often done by volunteers knocking on people’s doors.Capital gains taxCapital gains tax is a tax on profit when people sell assets that have increased in value.In the 2024 election, the Conservatives have promised that landlords who sell to sitting tenants will be spared capital gains tax on the proceeds, while Labour has left the door open to raising capital gains.Child benefitChild benefit is a benefit paid to parents with children under 16 (or under 20 in approved education or training).The Conservatives have promised to increase the threshold at which high earners start to lose the benefit from £60,000 to £120,000.Sir Keir Starmer, like the Conservatives, has pledged not to raise VAT. (Photo by Stefan Rousseau/PA Images via Getty Images)CoalitionA coalition government is a government formed jointly by more than one political party (for example, by the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives in 2010).ConstituencyThe geographical area that is represented by each MP in the House of Commons.ECHRThe European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is an international convention which protects human rights in Europe.The Conservative manifesto stopped short of promising to withdraw from the ECHR, which would have made plans such as the plan to deport migrants to Rwanda easier.Exit pollA poll conducted outside polling stations just after people have voted on election day.On election day, the results of Britain’s exit poll are published just after polls close at 10pm and tend to give a more accurate prediction of the result than previous polls produced throughout the campaign.First past the postThe first past the post system is used to elect MPs to the House of Commons.The candidate with the most votes in each constituency becomes MP, and the party with the most MPs becomes the government.This can mean that the winning party actually has a minority of votes cast: in 2019, the Conservatives had 43.6% of the vote.Hung parliamentA hung parliament is where no party has enough seats to form an overall majority. For example, both the 2010 election and 2017 elections resulted in hung parliament.In 2010, the Conservatives formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, while in 2017, the Conservatives formed a minority government with a 'confidence and supply' agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).Income tax thresholdThe thresholds between the tax-free allowance, basic rate tax and higher rates of tax.Both parties have said they will continue the freeze on income tax thresholds brought in under the Conservatives, which means people pay more tax as more and more people are pushed into higher tax brackets if wages rise.MajorityA party with a majority – more than half of the seats in the House of Commons – has won the election.The number of votes by which an individual MP wins a constituency is also referred to as their majority.ManifestoPolitical parties publish manifestos before a general election, with a set of policies that the party stands for and aims to implement if elected.Manifesto pledges are not legally binding.Marginal seatA seat in which the incumbent MP won by a small majority, meaning a swing is more likely than in a so-called ‘safe seat’ where the MP had a large majority.Net zeroThe UK Government has set a goal for Britain’s emissions to reach net zero – where emission and removal of greenhouse gases reaches equilibrium – by 2050.All major parties are expected to stick to this goal, barring Reform UK.Opinion pollAn opinion poll is a research survey (usually carried out on a representative sample of the electorate) to gauge likely results in an election.Poll‘The polls’ refers to the places where people vote in an election: exit polls and opinion polls refer to two kinds of survey used to predict election results.Postal voteAn absentee vote where the vote is sent in by post.At the 2019 general election, 17.2% of voters across the UK used a postal ballot.Proxy voteA vote where a person who can’t make it to the booth appoints someone to vote for them.In the 2019 election, 0.6% of voters appointed a proxy.PsephologyPsephology is the scientific study of elections and voting and is used to predict and analyse election results.Polling dayThe day when the country places their vote: in the UK 2024 election, this is July 4.PurdahBefore British elections, the country enters purdah, officially known as the ‘pre-election period of sensitivity’.Purdah means that politicians (both local and national) and other people such as civil servants face restrictions on what they can do and announce.Ministers who remain in office can’t announce new funding, or new policies, or anything which might sway voters or make the government more popular.The idea is that public money cannot be spent on the election.Spoiled ballotA ballot paper which has been marked wrongly (for instance with a vote for more than one candidate) will not be counted.Sometimes people spoil ballots deliberately as a protest vote to show dissatisfactionSwing‘Swing’ is the change in voter support for a political party between one election and the next.It is used to analyse the performance of parties in different areas.Tax burdenThe tax burden refers to the total amount of taxes paid by a group (in this case the UK as a whole) as a proportion of total income.The tax burden is currently at its highest in 70 years according to the OECD.The Equality ActThe 2010 Equality Act protects people against discrimination in Britain.The Conservatives want to ‘tweak’ the Act so that sex-based protections only apply on the basis of someone’s biological sex.Triple lockThe triple lock is a guarantee introduced to the state pension in 2010 so it would not lose value in real terms.The guarantee means that the state pension will rise by the highest out of average earnings, inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) or 2.5%.Triple lock plusThe ‘triple lock plus’ is a Conservative policy, which would see the tax-free pension allowance rise every year in line with the triple lock of average wages, inflation, or 2.5% – whichever is highest, to prevent pensioners being pulled into paying income tax.TurnoutTurnout refers to the percentage of people eligible to vote who turn out to vote on election day.In the 2019 election, for example, 67.3% of those eligible turned out to vote.VATValue added tax is added to goods and services sold by VAT-registered companies, and is the third-largest source of government income after income tax and national insurance.Both Labour and the Conservatives have pledged not to raise VAT.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

The Guardian,"‘Scunnered with the Tories, frustrated by the SNP’: Labour in bid to be Scotland’s biggest party",[],Michael Savage Policy Editor,23 June 2024 at 0:00 am·6-min read,23,June,2024,00:00:00,6,"Not for the first time, Blair McDougall, Labour’s candidate in East Renfrewshire on the outskirts of Glasgow, is telling a wavering voter that the election here is “so, so close”.If predictions of a knife-edge outcome weren’t enough to motivate him, many people – including some in Barrhead, which he is visiting today – have just received their postal ballots. Their votes will be cast in the next few days.“When you get to this stage in the campaign, you’re always second guessing yourself and wondering what’s that additional little competitive advantage that you can get,” he says. “The truth is we have been working flat out since November. We’ve been knocking on doors for 10 hours a day for months.”Next door in Glasgow South, Labour’s Gordon McKee is also trying to unseat the SNP with a similar message, warning that every vote counts. One woman, who previously voted SNP, says she is “60/40 for Labour”, but not over the line. Canvassers recall that she said she was a “four out of 10” previously, so perhaps one more visit might do it. “I’ve been involved in the Scottish Labour party for 10-plus years and it’s been a very difficult decade, but it feels like this is the best opportunity we’ve had for a long time,” says McKee. “People are totally scunnered with the Tories, frustrated by the SNP.”Both seats are part of what has become a key election battleground – Scotland’s central belt surrounding Edinburgh and Glasgow, where Labour is taking aim at the SNP. According to a YouGov MRP poll last week, McKee was ahead, while McDougall was just trailing. The pollster said 10 of Scotland’s seats were toss-ups between the two parties.McDougall in particular finds himself on the frontline of what could be a remarkable Labour recovery, potentially restoring it as Scotland’s biggest party in Westminster. After a whirlwind 16 months that began with the resignation of first minister Nicola Sturgeon, Labour’s cohort of MPs could rise to the high 20s, finally recovering to the numbers seen before its abrupt collapse at the 2015 election that took place after the independence referendum. Labour won just one Scottish seat in 2019. It came a distant third in “East Ren” last time.At the point of Sturgeon’s abrupt resignation in February last year, conventional wisdom suggested Labour was on for a strictly limited recovery. With the Tories tanking, Labour was squeezing them to win back a smattering of pro-union seats, including Lothian East, contested by former cabinet minister Douglas Alexander.The much bigger prize, however, was to peel off stubborn SNP votes, a necessary feat to open up far more seats. Sure enough, Sturgeon’s resignation preceded SNP travails that saw it embroiled in a police investigation over party funds, a bitter leadership battle and the implosion of Humza Yousaf’s reign as first minister after just 14 months. Veteran John Swinney, who launched the SNP manifesto last week, has been trying to steady things.“In the wake of [Yousaf’s resignation], the SNP find themselves about five points behind Labour,” said John Curtice, professor of politics at University of Strathclyde. “Although John Swinney has steadied the ship, it’s not clear he’s turned it around. At the moment, you would say Labour could be in the high 20s, possibly 30 seats and the SNP’s position as a third party in the Commons is at risk.”The most senior figures in Keir Starmer’s Labour accept the charge that fortune has been on their side, but argue it is only part of the story. “Yes we’ve had some good luck, but we’ve worked hard too,” says one. “It always takes both.” They point to Starmer’s brutal treatment of Scottish Labour’s former leader Richard Leonard, forcing his resignation in 2021. It was an early sign of his willingness to declare war on the party’s left flank in order to position the party to recover, should the circumstances present themselves.In fact, Labour insiders said East Renfrewshire, where McDougall is aiming to dislodge the SNP’s Kirsten Oswald, was part of a new tier of seats that only became possible targets as Yousaf’s Holyrood reign collapsed. McDougall says there are “two baskets of unhappy voters” – Tory and SNP – open to switching.Independence has also diminished as an all-encompassing issue. So toxic was the atmosphere in the 2015 election that, not far from the streets where McDougall was campaigning on Friday, a Labour canvasser was chased with a chainsaw. McDougall himself is well-known as the director of the pro-union Better Together campaign, yet both he and McKee encounter pro-independence SNP supporters on the doorstep and engage in polite discussion.The fall in the salience of independence has been crucial in Labour’s resurgence, according to Mark Diffley, a Scottish political polling expert. “Pretty much every poll, regardless of the pollster, has somewhere between 20-25% of people who support independence now saying that they will vote Labour in two weeks’ time, and that’s a massive change,” he says. “What Scottish Labour leader Anas Sawar has been saying is this election is just about getting rid of the Tories. That message seems to have worked with a relatively sizeable chunk of the pro-independence population.”The sentiment that Labour now represents change, the party’s one-word election slogan, is evident among some voters. John Mitchell, 50, in Barrhead, cites it as his motivation. “I would hope that Labour’s got a better shout this time, it’s the change, that’s the slogan isn’t it,” he says. “There’s people like me that need help.” Jim MacGowan, in Langside, Glasgow South, cites the SNP’s travails. “I’m disillusioned with the SNP,” he says. “Not for me.”But Labour doubts remain. Another voter in Glasgow South tells an activist that the SNP gives Scotland a voice, while expressing concern about Starmer’s decision to admit Natalie Elphicke, a rightwing Tory, into the party.Related: SNP investigated over claim funds misused to support general election candidatesSNP incumbents are also fighting hard. In East Renfrewshire, Oswald cites her record as an MP. Despite the most recent polling, she says backing the SNP is needed “to keep the Tories from coming back”, pointing out they won here in 2017. She adds that the SNP has shown a “hopeful alternative to the Westminster system, which I think most people would agree has shown itself to be pretty broken”.Elsewhere, the SNP has attacked Labour from the left over Starmer’s refusal to scrap the two-child benefit limit. Curtice notes: “Small movements between Labour and SNP could make a notable difference to seat tallies, but so far the polls suggest little has changed in the campaign.”In both Glasgow South and East Renfrewshire, some swing voters seemed more driven by disapproval of the SNP’s performance than by enthusiasm for Labour. McDougall’s candid response to that charge reflects the calculated caution that Starmer recently branded as “realistic hope”.“Generally speaking, people aren’t looking for grand visions and ideologies,” McDougall says. “They’re looking for someone who is just going to get up in the morning and try to fix the things in their life. I think that’s a conversation we have to have thousands and thousands of times.” Labour’s success here, as elsewhere, may come down to whether the promise of slow, steady, boring progress has become an attractive one."

Many also assume his title is hereditary.So what do you really need to know about the man who, on current poll ratings, is set to be the UK’s next prime minister?His early lifeKeir Starmer was born in Southwark, south London, in 1962, as the second of four children. His parents were Labour Party members and named him after Keir Hardie, the party’s first leader in parliament.The family moved out of the capital and he grew up in Hurst Green, a village just outside the small Surrey town of Oxted. He was active in youth politics from his teenage years but was also a skilled musician, taking music lessons alongside Norman Cook, who later became better known as a member of The Housemartins and the DJ Fatboy Slim.Starmer played the flute, piano, violin and recorder and was a junior exhibitioner at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.His familyStarmer is married to Victoria, a former solicitor who later retrained in occupational health and now works for the NHS. The pair met through their work in the law in the early 2000s and married in Essex in 2007.She was first seen accompanying her husband when the couple were filmed clapping for carers during the pandemic in 2020 outside their home in Camden. They have two children, a son and daughter, but both are kept out of the public eye.Victoria's father was Jewish and originally came from Poland, while her mother converted when they got married. Starmer has said in a previous interview that ""my wife in particular wants our children to know the faith of her family"" and that they ""observe some of the practices, for example Friday night prayers"".Keir Starmer with parents, Rodney and Josephine, at his graduation. (Twitter/Keir Starmer)His parentsThe Labour leader's father, Rodney Starmer, worked as a toolmaker in a factory, and his mother Josephine Starmer (née Baker), was a nurse.His father worked long, 14-hour days but spent his time outside work caring for Josephine, who was diagnosed with the autoimmune condition Still’s disease. She required two hip and knee replacements twice in her lifetime and struggled with arthritic pain.As a young man Starmer also helped care for his mother, which he has said led to him being more emotionally reserved. His sister, Katy, recalled: “He’s had to be a grown-up all his life. I’ve always been quite open about my feelings – Keir is good at most things, but not that.” Josephine Starmer died in 2015, and his father three years later.His educationStarmer passed the 11-plus examination, and attended Reigate Grammar School from age 11. While he was at the school it became an independent fee-paying institution, but as an existing student he was exempt from fees, and his tuition in the sixth form was covered by a bursary.After school he studied law at the University of Leeds, this first in his family to attend university, graduating with a first class degree in 1985. He undertook postgraduate law studied at the University of Oxford, where he served as editor of a radical magazine, Socialist Alternatives.A photograph of a younger Starmer as shown on ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories in 2021. (ITV)Why is he a sir?Stamer was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 2014 in recognition of his work in the legal profession, culminating in a five-year term as Director of Public Prosecutions.He first became a barrister in 1987 at the Middle Temple, later joining Doughty Street Chambers and was appointed a Queen’s Counsel in 2002, aged just 39. In 2008 he was appointed head of the Crown Prosecution Service and DPP.During his tenure he chose to prosecute three Labour MPs and a Conservative in the wake of the parliamentary expenses scandal, and was responsible for prosecuting former MP Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce for perverting the course of justice after Pryce claimed responsibility for her former husband’s speeding offence.Starmer on... the NHSThe Labour leader has said that, if elected, his government would “get the NHS working around the clock and pay staff properly to do it”.The remark followed a commitment to provide £1.1bn in funding for the health service to cut waiting lists by paying doctors and nurses to carry out additional out-of-hours care, which would be funded by axing tax breaks for wealthy “non-doms” who hoard money overseas. He added: “The Conservative Party that brought our NHS to its knees will put it in the ground. We have to get it back on its feet.”Starmer describes the NHS as “the crowdfunded solution for all of us”, reinforcing his commitment to healthcare being free at the point of use, but says reform is inevitable or the health service would “remain on life support”. He has pledged to integrate up-to-date technology into every part of the NHS including using artificial intelligence to diagnose disease earlier and more accurately.He supported the doctors strikes, telling ministers: “Don’t break junior doctors, talk to them.

Starmer has said a Labour government would set up a new policy unit to tackle illegal migration and has suggested that a returns agreement for asylum seekers could be negotiated with the European Union to solve the small boats crisis.He described the government’s thwarted Rwanda plan, which would see illegal migrants deported to the African nation but has to be put into practice due to legal blocks, as a “gimmick” and a “farce” and has promised to reverse it.Starmer on... the cost of living crisisStarmer has sought to keep Rishi Sunak’s handling of the cost of living crisis in the minds of voters by claiming that “his fingerprints are all over their struggling household budgets”. In a letter to his shadow cabinet, leaked to The Guardian, he wrote: “Rishi Sunak is the chief architect of choices prioritising the wealthiest and of the government’s failure to get a grip of the economy and get growth going.”He has said he would prioritise tackling inflation, blaming it for putting up prices and eroding household savings, but has pledged to “take the difficult and responsible decisions” to bring it down.Starmer pictured in 2010, when he was director of public prosecution at the CPS, making a statement about MPs who face charges over their expenses claims.

The money raised, he said, will be used to address the “appalling state” of the school system for all children.“It’s not an attack on private schools. It’s just saying an exemption you have had is going to go,” he warned private schools who have been critical of the plan – reminding them they are not obliged to pass that tax on to parents in the form of increased fees.Starmer on… the House of LordsWhen he was first Labour leader, Starmer proposed a “root and branch reform of the centre of government… rooting out unearned privilege and addressing unaccountable power”.But his promise to scrap the House of Lords within the first four years of a new parliament - a controversial move that caused a split among his party’s grandees, has been abandoned.Starmer still backs plans for a second chamber “electoral legitimacy”, but as his party nears government he has stepped away from the most radical form of that pledge. He is now reportedly committed to cutting the number of hereditary peers, reducing the size of the chamber and introducing a new appointments process."
Yahoo News UK,Who is Ed Davey? Lib Dem leader attracts attention with election stuntsEverything you need to know about the former minister who has pledged to fight for the NHS.,[],Hannah Fearn,7 June 2024 at 11:47 am·7-min read,7,June,2024,11:47:00,7,"Ed Davey has been involved in a number of comedy stunts since the election was called. (Alamy) With the spotlight on prime minister Rishi Sunak and Labour leader Keir Starmer as they prepare to slug it out in a general election campaign, the focus had started slipping from Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey until a series of stunts put him back in the spotlight.The former coalition government cabinet minister - who lost his seat, punished by voters for getting into bed with the Tories, but then won it back again - is sending a clear message that he should not be overlooked.He’s had a long political career and the climax may still be ahead: if polls continue to shift away from the Conservatives at the current trajectory, there’s a slim possibility that, if the election is held in October, he could end up as Leader of the Opposition.So what do we know about the man behind the third party in British politics? Hannah Fearn finds out.His early lifeEd Davey was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on Christmas Day in 1965. He was the youngest of three boys, but lost his father at just four years old, and his mother followed over a decade later when he was in his mid-teens. She spent three years battling cancer, during which time he nursed his mother together with his grandmother and brother Henry.Once a keen Scout and Air Scout, he later remembers feeling “isolated” at school because of his caring responsibilities, which meant he couldn’t take part in after-school activities or sports. “The last 18 months she was bedridden and in a lot of pain. I’d spend hours on the bed, talking to her,” he said. Davey was with his mother when she died at Nottingham General Hospital, after being placed on an unsuited dementia ward.After both his parents had died, Davey was brought up by his maternal grandparents in the village of Eakring, though his grandfather died soon after. He spent much of his childhood and young adulthood close to his grandmother. “First of all, she was looking after me. Then we were looking after each other,” he said.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

The strict rule that governs what politicians can and can't sayHis familyDavey married Emily Gasson, a former Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate, in 2005. Gasson stood in four elections but failed to win a seat and is now a councillor. The pair have two children, a son and daughter.Their son, born in 2007 and now a teenager, is disabled with a neurological condition. He attended special schools but is now educated at home with a tutor - a change that Davey said led to him becoming verbal for the first time. He has spoken about his anxiety about who will care for his son when he and his wife are no longer around. “It’s the thing that worries me more than anything else in my life,” he said.Gasson was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in 2012. She was well for many years following her diagnosis, but declined during lockdown and is working on recovering her physical strength.Liberal Democrats election broadcast shows Ed Davey with his son. (Liberal Democrats)His parentsHis father, John, was a solicitor and his mother, Nina, a teacher. Davey has described how he was inspired to study by his mother, who always wanted him to try hard academically and who he wanted to impress.His educationDavey attended the private Nottingham High School, the alma mater of former chancellor Kenneth Clarke. He became head boy, with Labour MP Ed Balls - who was studying in the year below - watching on. After school, he achieved a first class degree in philosophy, politics and economics at Jesus College, Oxford where he was junior common room president. After becoming an economics research for the Liberal Democrats he returned to study, reading for a master’s degree in economics at Birkbeck College, London.Ed Davey, pictured with his family. (Liberal Democrats)Why is he a sir?For three years, the Lib Dem leader was a member of the cabinet during the period of Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, holding the post of secretary of state for energy and climate change from 2012 to 2015. He was knighted in the 2016 New Year’s Honours for “political and public services”.Davey on... the cost of living crisisDavey has repeatedly attacked the government for failing to curb rapid inflation and the devastating effect it is having on household budgets. He called the Conservative Party “so out of touch they might as well be living on another planet”, and said he warned Jeremy Hunt “people are desperate for real help… but all the chancellor could offer is empty words and unfair tax hikes”. In particular, he has urged more action on food price inflation, which analysis from his own party found had risen 37 per cent in one year for the average weekly supermarket trip. He has promised to end energy hikes and abandoned his plan to add 1p to income tax to save the NHS because ordinary voters can no longer afford it.Davey on... the NHSThe Liberal Democrats have made the NHS a cornerstone of their policy platform for the last five years. In Davey’s words: “Voting Conservative is bad for your health.” He promises to reverse cuts to GP numbers and guarantee a doctor’s appointment when you need one, improve access to NHS dentistry and save lives by tackling ambulance call out delays. Davey blames the care crisis for deepening the problems of the health service and says his party would spend £5bn a year on a “care package” to ensure patients are discharged from hospital more quickly, freeing up bed space. However, there is little detail on how this would be financed without raising taxes on the wealthiest - which Davey has promised not to do in his push to poach disillusioned Tory voters.British Leader of the Liberal Democrats party Ed Davey arrives at the BBC Broadcasting House, for his appearance on 'Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg', in London, Britain, April 28, 2024. REUTERS/Maja SmiejkowskaDavey on... immigrationThe Lib Dem leader has been a long-standing advocate for refugee rights and critic of the government’s immigration policy. He has called for Conservative plans to deport failed asylum seekers to Rwanda a “cynical distraction” from the partygate crisis and the money would be better spent on measures to tackle the cost of living crisis. He added: “They’ve provided no evidence to suggest that this new policy will stop illegal smuggling, they’re not cracking down on the organised crime gangs, which is what you need to do.” He has called for a new right to work for refugees and asylum seekers, and major reform of the Home Office which he says is no longer up to the job. After the end of the coalition government, Davey has said his party “was wrong” to go along with the introduction of a minimum income standard for immigrants. He later described the policy as “nasty and unfair”.Davey on... the Post Office scandalDespite the Horizon scandal that led to the wrongful prosecution of more than 700 subpostmasters crossing the tenure of more than a dozen business secretaries, Ed Davey has recently taken the heat for failing to investigate the issue while he was in the job.It has emerged that Davey initially rejected a request to meet justice campaigner Alan Bates, and later accepted it only on the advice that it would be good for his PR. He has recently apologised for not acting earlier, admitting that he is sorry that he “did not see through Post Office lies” about the fault in the Horizon programme."
The Telegraph,Starmer: Wealth redistribution ‘not enough’ to level up Britain,[],Camilla Turner,22 June 2024 at 4:30 pm·4-min read,22,June,2024,04:30:00,4,"State handouts offer people less “dignity” than earning a living through work, Sir Keir Starmer has said.The Labour leader said that “working people” wanted “success more than state support” as he declared that if he were to be elected prime minister, he would put wealth creation “front and centre”.Sir Keir also warned that “redistribution” alone was not enough to “level-up” Britain, saying that “redistribution seems to have also become our ‘one-word’ plan for vast swathes of Britain”.Britain’s benefits bill has ballooned amid a sharp increase in worklessness since the pandemic, with analysis published last week revealing that surging sickness benefit claims will drive an increase in Britain’s welfare bill of more than £20 billion a year by 2030.Sir Keir’s comments mark a toughening of his rhetoric about those who rely on the state welfare system. They will be seen as an overt pitch to socially conservative voters, but risk sparking a backlash within his own party.Writing for The Telegraph, he said: “Serving the interests of working people means understanding they want success more than state support.“Yes, this is about aspiration. I know our country is driven by it. Entrepreneurs. Parents working extra hours to give their children security. Young people striving for their first home.“But it is also about dignity. The Labour mission was built on the pride of working people earning a decent living for themselves.“We will never turn our backs on people who are struggling. But handouts from the state do not nurture the same sense of self-reliant dignity as a fair wage.”Sir Keir outlined his harder stance on welfare ahead of the final full week of the election campaign, in which he will face two head-to-head broadcast debates against Rishi Sunak. The Labour leader will visit battleground seats in the Midlands, while Mr Sunak will travel to Scotland to launch the Scottish Tory manifesto.Mr Sunak has made a crackdown on the welfare bill a core part of his manifesto offering, promising an overhaul of sick notes to get more people back into work and tougher sanctions for those who are able to seek work but choose not to.By contrast, the Labour manifesto contains little in the way of concrete actions on benefits, though it does commit to a review of Universal Credit “so that it makes work pay and tackles poverty”.It also promises to tackle the backlog of access to work claims and to reform or replace the work capability assessment that determines if people are fit to work, as well as come up with a “proper plan” to support disabled people into employment.Sir Keir’s remarks about benefits claimants risk opening up divisions within Labour. Several senior Left-wing figures are already furious about Sir Keir’s decision to retain the two-child benefit cap.The policy, introduced by George Osborne when he was chancellor, means low-income parents are not eligible for key benefits, including universal credit, for their third and any subsequent children born after April 2017.Sir Keir said he was “proud” that Labour’s manifesto was a “plan for wealth creation”, adding: “Indeed, as far as I’m concerned, making people better off is the whole point of politics.”He said that sustained economic growth was the “only remedy” for the “malaise” in Britain, adding: “I accept it’s unusual for a Labour leader to put wealth creation front and centre. I also understand why there is an emphasis on tax and spend this election. After 14 years of next to no growth, to doggedly pursue it is almost a new concept.”He also insisted that he would keep taxes down, saying “make no mistake…We will not raise income tax, national insurance or VAT”.Sir Keir said he did not want to raise taxes because “it isn’t fair for working people to lose more of their money in a cost of living crisis” or for the “failures of government to cost your pocket”."
The Independent,Tories believe Sunak ‘has given up’ after surprise auction lot admission at fundraiser,[],David Maddox,22 June 2024 at 11:32 am·2-min read,22,June,2024,11:32:00,2,"Rishi Sunak appeared to run up the white flag of surrender at the Conservatives’ summer garden party fundraiser, with what guests saw as an acceptance that he will not be prime minister after 4 July.The event at the Hurlingham Club, one of London’s most exclusive venues, on Thursday, was meant to be one of the party’s major fundraisers during the year, and came in the middle of an election campaign where the Tories have, according to insiders, run out of money.Mr Sunak was due to attend but, because of his date with the audience on the BBC’s Question Time, only appeared by video message instead, while other cabinet ministers showed up in person.Rishi Sunak speaking on the campaign trail (PA)But the highlight was supposed to be an auction of different lots, where wealthy supporters such as Lord Ashcroft would bid to help raise party funds.One lot included classic election campaign posters from the past, which Mr Sunak promised to sign personally.However, crucially, when the lot was being offered to guests they were assured that Mr Sunak “will sign it before 4 July so it will be guaranteed to be signed by a sitting prime minister.”Guests have told The Independent that it was taken as a sign that Mr Sunak and his top team have “given up” and “raised the white flag” on winning and are resigned to defeat on 4 July.The same claim was made when defence secretary Grant Shapps first warned against a Labour “super majority”. Mr Sunak has denied this and told the Question Time audience on Thursday that he “will fight to the end and not give up”.Another lot offered an evening with LBC radio host Iain Dale, cabinet minister Michael Gove and Mr Sunak’s political secretary James Forsyth.It reportedly went for £30,000 but according to those present someone shouted out: “I will pay money not to have an evening with them!”A picture of the Foreign Office signed by nine foreign secretaries went for £20,000.The event was hosted by home secretary James Cleverly and his wife Susie in the absence of the prime minister.However, a number of former donors have told The Independent that they refused to go.In a sign of desperation, the party even started asking angry people who were on the candidates list but blocked from getting a seat if they could help fill tables.Nevertheless, Tory sources said the evening raised £700,000.However, it comes as insiders have told The Independent that the party “ran out of money on day two of the campaign”.The latest donations saw the Conservatives in third place behind both Labour and Reform UK.The Tories raised £292,500 while Reform got £335,000 and Labour raised £4,383,400.The Independent has asked the Conservatives for a comment."
Yahoo News UK,"Who is Richard Tice? Reform’s former leader turned Farage sidekickThe candidate for Hartlepool has seen his party's popularity swell in recent months, with one poll showing reform ahead of the Conservatives.",[],Andrew Naughtie,Updated 14 June 2024 at 6:45 am·6-min read,14,June,2024,06:45:00,6,"Now that Nigel Farage has taken over as the leader of Reform UK, Richard Tice’s public profile is fading fast - but the Reform chairman remains involved in the party's operations.So far, the party has only one MP, Conservative defector Lee Anderson. But a recent poll has shown Reform overtaking the Tories, raising the possibility Anderson could hold his seat and even end up with fellow Reformers in the next Parliament.As the candidate for Hartlepool, where he stood as the Brexit Party candidate in 2019, Tice hopes to be one of them. So who is he, and what does he stand for?Childhood and educationBorn in Surrey in 1964 to James Tice, a showjumper, and Joan Tice, a horse trainer. Educated at the private boarding school Uppingham, he studied at the University of Salford, gaining a degree in construction economics and quantity surveying – teeing him up for a career that he said would ""continue the family genes in the property industry"".Family (partner & kids)Tice has three children from a 24-year marriage that ended in divorce. He is now in a long-term relationship with the right-wing writer and journalist Isabel Oakeshott.She is perhaps best known for two notorious incidents that set her against leading Tories: a book that featured the heavily disputed allegation that David Cameron had engaged in sexual activity with a pig, and the release of embarrassing messages entrusted to her by Matt Hancock when she agreed to write a book with him.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election? Full list mappedThe key issues that will decide the electionWhen is the first UK general election TV debate?What is purdah? The strict rule that governs what politicians can and can't sayNet worthWhile not quite in the same league as Rishi Sunak, Tice is one of the wealthiest people in British politics. As he describes it on his website, he made his multi-million-pound fortune over the course of “30 years of making things happen in property investment”, starting with a graduate job at a London firm in 1987.According to Tice, the company he leads as CEO, Quidnet Capital, has “bought and managed £500 million in commercial properties across the UK on behalf of clients”.He was also a key figure in the redevelopment of London’s Nine Elms district, near Battersea Power Station, a controversial project that has transformed a stretch of the Thames’s south bank with a welter of rapidly erected high-rise blocks.GB News linksAlong with Nigel Farage, Lee Anderson and several MPs on the right flank of the Tory party, Tice is a regular on the hard-right, culture war-focused TV outlet GB News. There he hosts a programme called “Richard Tice’s Sunday Sermon”, which serves as a platform for him to deliver his political analysis without the interruptions of an interviewer.However, despite the network being a relatively safe space for him in ideological terms, Tice’s appearances aren’t always amicable. A recent interview with host Andrew Pierce, a longtime right-wing commentator, saw him challenged fiercely about Reform’s chances in a summer election should one be called – with Pierce pointing to the “weirdos” selected by the party to fight numerous seats as evidence the party is “not ready”.Richard Tice, pictured in 2018 at a 'Leave Means Leave' campaign event, is focused on the issue of immigration. (Steve Finn/WENN)Tice was also involved in an incident that saw the network deemed in breach of broadcasting regulator Ofcom’s impartiality regulations, specifically an interview in which a former Brexit Party MEP failed to “sufficiently challenge” his views on immigration.The regulator is under increasing pressure to crack down on GB News heading into the election, with critics arguing it cannot be allowed to broadcast shows that feature Tory and Reform MPs interviewing each other without alternative points of view represented.Tice on NHSThe state and future of the NHS set to be one of this election’s main battlegrounds, and Reform’s key health policy is to spend £17 billion on the NHS on top of its current budget in an effort to get waiting lists down to zero. It also proposes introducing tax relief on private healthcare – something that has been criticised by opponents as a creeping step towards the privatisation of healthcare writ large.Tice’s stated rationale is that the reason the service is struggling is because the money it needs is being spent on other things that the public do not in fact support. Top of the list is Net Zero, which the party and its predecessors have long decried as a pointless “woke” project.In April, Tice used a press conference to frame the choice starkly. “We have a choice in this country, it seems to me,” he said. “A pretty clear choice. Do we want zero waiting lists in two years, and to keep them there? That is the Reform choice. Or do we want net zero CO2 emissions in 25 years? That is the Labour choice.”Tice on immigrationImmigration is by far Reform UK’s top issue, with the party looking to build on Farage’s two decades of campaigning against it in its legal and illegal forms.As far as the election goes, Tice and the party are targeting the continuing arrival of small boats of people travelling across the English Channel, many of them seeking asylum. He has criticised the government for failing to stop “mass immigration” post-Brexit, and described Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda policy as “a disaster”, arguing on GB News that its supposed deterrent value was revealed to be zero just hours after the House of Commons finally passed the law.Reform chairman Richard Tice (L) and leader Nigel Farage speak at the party's economic policy launch at Church House in London. (Alamy Live News)“Within a matter of hours more boats, absolutely packed full, overfilled with illegal migrants, were setting off from the beaches. And we learnt on Tuesday morning that sadly five people, including a young child, drowned leaving the beaches. That's not a deterrent. That's an absolute disaster.”Instead of deporting people to Rwanda, he is arguing for a “pick up and take back” policy that would see small boat arrivals deposited back on French soil. As evidence that this is both practical and humane, he has cited similar policies deployed in the US and Australia.However, he has not addressed the fact that Australia’s policy has been criticised internationally for leaving so-called “boat people” confined to facilities on the island of Nauru, where there have been incidents of suicide and self-immolation.Tice on cost of living crisisPerhaps unsurprisingly given he is trying to peel away former Tory voters, Tice has criticised recent Tory prime ministers harshly for overseeing Britain’s intense cost of living crisis. In 2022, he accused then-prime minister Boris Johnson of “waffling” over the situation. “Clueless, out of touch, no ideas, no help,” he tweeted. “Shocking.”He has also warned that the prospect of a “disastrous” Labour government will offer no prospect of meaningful relief for struggling households.Instead, Reform proposes lifting the minimum level of income tax to £20,000 while cutting various other taxes – among them fuel duty, another gesture to the party’s rejection of environmentalism as a top priority."
The Telegraph,Sunak accuses Farage of playing into Putin’s hands as Reform leader doubles down on Ukraine claim,[],Will Hazell,22 June 2024 at 2:40 pm·33-min read,22,June,2024,02:40:00,33,"Rishi Sunak has accused Nigel Farage of “playing into Putin’s hands” by saying that the West “provoked” Russia into invading Ukraine.The Reform UK leader received a barrage of criticism from across the political spectrum on Saturday after he claimed that the “ever-eastward expansion of Nato and the European Union” gave Vladimir Putin a justification to attack.The Prime Minister said the comments were “completely wrong”, while Sir Keir Starmer labelled them “disgusting”.Ben Wallace, the former defence secretary, branded Mr Farage a “pub bore” with “simplistic answers” to “complex problems”.However, writing for The Telegraph, Mr Farage refused to back down, claiming that his warnings about Western foreign policy had been “proved right”.The row erupted after Mr Farage was asked in a BBC Panorama interview with Nick Robinson on Friday why he had “blamed the West” for Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.He replied: “It was obvious to me that the ever-eastward expansion of Nato and the European Union was giving this man a reason to his Russian people to say, ‘they’re coming for us again’ and to go to war.”Pressed on whether his rhetoric was echoing that of the Russian president, he said: “But, hang on a second, we provoked this war. It’s – you know, of course, it’s his fault, he’s used what we’ve done as an excuse.”On Saturday, Mr Sunak said: “What he said was completely wrong and only plays into Putin’s hands.“This is a man who deployed nerve agents on the streets of Britain, who’s doing deals with countries like North Korea. And this kind of appeasement is dangerous for Britain’s security, the security of our allies that rely on us and only emboldens Putin further.”Sir Keir said: “Nigel Farage’s comments were disgusting. Russia is the aggressor and Putin bears the responsibility.”Speaking on the BBC’s Today programme, Mr Wallace claimed that the Reform leader was “a bit like that pub bore we have all met at the end of the bar who often says if ‘I was running the country’ and presents very simplistic answers to … complex problems”.He added that the comments reflected a “rather odd admiration of totalitarian leaders that we hear from parts of the Trump campaign and some of the Farage lot – ‘oh well he’s a good old strong leader’”.Mr Wallace said: “Well he might be a good old strong leader but he’s done that at the expense of sacrificing half a million Russians dead, injured or deserted and on track to be lost by the end of this year. I don’t want that anywhere in our politics.”But in his article for The Telegraph, Mr Farage claimed he had been the victim of a “slur”.“I am not and never have been an apologist or supporter of Putin,” he said. “His invasion of Ukraine was immoral, outrageous and indefensible. As a champion of national sovereignty, I believe that Putin was entirely wrong to invade the sovereign nation of Ukraine. Nobody can fairly accuse me of being an appeaser. I have never sought to justify Putin’s invasion in any way and I’m not now.“But that doesn’t change the fact that I saw it coming a decade ago, warned that it was coming and am one of the few political figures who has been consistently right and honest about Russia’s Ukraine war.“What I have been saying for the past 10 years is that the West has played into Putin’s hands, giving him the excuse to do what he wanted to do anyway.”He added: “If you poke the Russian bear with a stick, don’t be surprised if he responds.”Mr Farage claimed that he was questioning “political conformism” on Ukraine. “The escalation of British support for the war in Ukraine has not even been an issue in this election campaign, since the old parties all agree with it,” he said.On Saturday, he was gained support from George Galloway, the veteran hard-Left politician and outspoken Nato critic, who posted on X: “The absolute hysteria over Nigel Farage telling the truth about the Ukraine war is the shape of things to come.“The establishment narrative over this and a hundred other things is a Potemkin Village – paper thin!”05:21 PM BSTRecap of today’s eventsNigel Farage has faced a storm of criticism over his claims the West was responsible for Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.Rishi Sunak, Keir Starmer, Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, John Swinney, the SNP leader, and Ben Wallace, the former defence secretary, all hit out at Mr Farage for his comments.Separately, Sir Keir ruled out rejoining the EU following Kemi Badenoch’s claim that a vote for Labour was a vote to overturn Brexit.While on the campaign trail on Saturday the Labour leader pledged a “fundamental reset to respect and dignity” for the Windrush generation.
