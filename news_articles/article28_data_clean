PM battles to stay in power after election gambleAs the prime minister calls a snap election, here’s everything you need to know about Rishi Sunak and what he’s saying about the biggest issues in British politics","['Early life', ""Sunak's family"", 'His parents', 'His education', 'How much is he worth?', 'His religion', 'Sunak on... the NHS', 'Sunak on… immigration', 'Sunak on... the cost of living crisis', 'Sunak on... pensions']",Hannah Fearn,23 May 2024 at 4:21 am·8-min read,23,May,2024,04:21:00,8,"Rishi Sunak has the fight of his political life ahead of him after calling a snap general election for 4 July. The polls have consistently painted a very bleak picture for the prime minister, with Labour holding on to a double-digit poll lead over his Conservatives.Recent by-election results suggest that Labour is likely to win a landslide victory – but there’s still time for the PM to turn it around.Here’s everything you need to know about Sunak and what’s he’s saying about the biggest issues in British politics right now.Early lifeSunak was born in Southampton in 1980, the eldest of three children. His Indian parents both arrived from East Africa in the 1960s. A football-mad boy whose childhood idol was Matt Le Tissier, Sunak was described by the family’s neighbours as a child with “lovely manners”.In his youngest years, the PM attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. According to a recent biography, fellow pupil Ollie Case said: “He was someone that was talked about. The teachers would say: ‘He’s going to be prime minister'.""But, growing up in the 1980s and 90s, he also remembers experiencing racism. “My mother was obsessed with us not having accents,” Sunak has said.Rishi Sunak was football-mad as a boy growing up in Southampton. (ITV)Sunak's familySunak is married to Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian entrepreneur and multi-billionaire. The pair first met in 2004 at Stanford University, his future wife apparently attracted to his “honesty and integrity”.Five years later they married in a two-day Indian wedding held in Bangalore. The couple have two daughters, Krishna and Anoushka, who will turn 13 and 11 this year, both of whom are largely kept out of the public eye.Sunak attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. (Rishi Sunak, Instagram)His parentsYashvir Sunak, Rishi’s father, was born in Kenya. He arrived in the UK to study medicine and then stayed, becoming an NHS GP. His mother, Usha, was born in Tanzania and is a pharmacist.The couple met in Britain and settled in Southampton in the 1970s. Usha is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.His educationAs a teenager Sunak studied at Winchester College where he was, he says, a self-confessed “geek”. According to a recent biography, the “naughtiest” thing the prime minister did during his school days “was to smuggle a hand-held television into the school so that he did not miss any key games of Euro 96”.The childhood home of Rishi Sunak in Southampton. (Getty Images, photo taken in 2022)Perhaps unsurprisingly for someone with such an unblemished record, he went on to become the school’s head boy. Sunak worked while studying, delivering medicines for his mother’s pharmacy and as a waiter at a local Indian restaurant.After school, Sunk read philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, graduating in 2001 with a first class degree. While still at university he held an internship at the Conservative Party campaign headquarters and joined the party, but went on studying before entering politics.He earned his MBA from Stanford in 2006 as a Fulbright Scholar, meaning he was selected among the most promising candidates from the UK.How much is he worth?As prime minister, Rishi Sunak earns £80,807 on top of a salary of £84,144 for being an MP. But his current income from Westminster pales in comparison to his family’s vast wealth through marriage.The Sunday Times valued the couple’s joint fortune at £730m. Murty's father is the co-founder of Infosys, an Indian tech conglomerate, in which she holds shares estimated at around £430m. Her family is also involved in a £900m business arrangement with Amazon in India, and she is a shareholder of multiple other companies.Rishi Sunak's mother is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.Before entering politics Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and a series of hedge funds. He is also known to have invested in blind trusts, in which investments are made without holders knowing where the funds are located. These arrangements reportedly hold Sunak’s own multi-million-pound fortune.His religionSunak is not only the first prime minister of colour and of Indian heritage but he is also the first practising Hindu to hold the biggest job in UK politics.He has spoken of his pride in his Hindu faith, saying, “that’s how I was raised, and that’s how I am”. He said: “Having faith gives you resilience, gives you strength that is important and it provides an outlook on life which I find particularly valuable.”Sunak on... the NHSThe prime minister’s biggest challenge in office has been the crisis in the NHS - and to many people in the sector his government has been found wanting. “We have not made enough progress,” Sunak said when asked about his commitment to cut NHS waiting lists during an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV. Asked if that meant he had failed, the prime minister replied: “Yes, we have.""Sunak expects to see waiting lists start to reduce this spring, and blames the delays on “industrial action”, as disputes with junior doctors and consultants over pay and conditions continue. Yet Sunak himself has been blamed for holding up a deal that would prevent more walkouts.Sunak, his wife Akshata and daughters Anoushka and Krishna (second left) at Santa Monica Pier, California, on their summer holiday in 2023. (AP)Sunak on… immigrationAccording to the prime minister, illegal migration threatens to “overwhelm” Europe. In June 2023 he claimed his plan to “stop the boats” and tackle illegal immigration was working, but by August 2023 he had changed his mind: “It’s not an easy problem to fix,” he told broadcasters. “I never said we would be able to solve it overnight.”He has staked much of his reputation on the government's Rwanda Bill - his plan to deport asylum seekers to the east African country that finally became law last month, after months of legal and procedural challenges. It has paved the way for deportation flights to get off the ground within weeks.He described his policy, which he says will act as a deterrent to people traffickers, as being “the will of the people” – yet polling suggests low support for such a punitive approach.The policy, coupled with Conservative talk of limits on legal migration, shows that the government is committed to taking a hard line on the issue, despite the risk of alienating more moderate voters.The Rwanda policy is not universally popular. (YouGov)Sunak on... the cost of living crisisThe prime minister has told hard-pressed working families that they will feel some relief from the cost of living crisis as inflation continues to drop following its highs of October 2022. He described the government’s tax cuts as “meaningful” and has welcomed the dip in mortgage rates at the turn of the year.Sunak says falling inflation will have the biggest impact on family budgets “and will start to ease some of those pressures” and that he was right to focus on that figure. However, the global drop in energy prices is probably the biggest factor in easing the hit on wallets - something that the prime minister has no control over.However, the fall in inflation to 2.3% on 22 May this year – the lowest it has been in nearly three years – was likely one of the key factors in persuading Sunak to call a snap election many weeks earlier than experts had predicted.Can we expect more handouts or tax breaks to help balance family budgets? Not according to Sunak, who has warned voters that it’s time to “move on” from government support.Sunak on... pensionsThe triple-lock pensions policy is a tricky one for Sunak – especially since Labour has committed to retaining the policy. Any change to a policy that has become a hallmark of recent Conservative governments would not go down well with the 12 million pensioners it would likely impact – many of whom are lifelong Tory voters.Last November, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said pensions should start being pegged to an average of inflation and wage growth, which would help reduce state spending over time.Sunak’s response to that was ambiguous to say the least: “We are the government that has … delivered the triple lock and it is why, right now, pensions are, depending on how you look at it, £800 or £900 bigger than they otherwise would have been.” He is yet to confirm whether it will appear in the manifesto."

The term is also sometimes used to refer to the election itself, as in ‘they could not win at the ballot box’.CampaignThe time before an election in which politicians persuade people to vote for them. In the case of the 2024 election in the UK, parliament was dissolved on the 30 May and the election will take place on 4 July.CanvassingGoing round a particular area trying to persuade people to vote for one party or the other.In UK elections, this is often done by volunteers knocking on people’s doors.Capital gains taxCapital gains tax is a tax on profit when people sell assets that have increased in value.In the 2024 election, the Conservatives have promised that landlords who sell to sitting tenants will be spared capital gains tax on the proceeds, while Labour has left the door open to raising capital gains.Child benefitChild benefit is a benefit paid to parents with children under 16 (or under 20 in approved education or training).The Conservatives have promised to increase the threshold at which high earners start to lose the benefit from £60,000 to £120,000.Sir Keir Starmer, like the Conservatives, has pledged not to raise VAT. (Photo by Stefan Rousseau/PA Images via Getty Images)CoalitionA coalition government is a government formed jointly by more than one political party (for example, by the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives in 2010).ConstituencyThe geographical area that is represented by each MP in the House of Commons.ECHRThe European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is an international convention which protects human rights in Europe.The Conservative manifesto stopped short of promising to withdraw from the ECHR, which would have made plans such as the plan to deport migrants to Rwanda easier.Exit pollA poll conducted outside polling stations just after people have voted on election day.On election day, the results of Britain’s exit poll are published just after polls close at 10pm and tend to give a more accurate prediction of the result than previous polls produced throughout the campaign.First past the postThe first past the post system is used to elect MPs to the House of Commons.The candidate with the most votes in each constituency becomes MP, and the party with the most MPs becomes the government.This can mean that the winning party actually has a minority of votes cast: in 2019, the Conservatives had 43.6% of the vote.Hung parliamentA hung parliament is where no party has enough seats to form an overall majority. For example, both the 2010 election and 2017 elections resulted in hung parliament.In 2010, the Conservatives formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, while in 2017, the Conservatives formed a minority government with a 'confidence and supply' agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).Income tax thresholdThe thresholds between the tax-free allowance, basic rate tax and higher rates of tax.Both parties have said they will continue the freeze on income tax thresholds brought in under the Conservatives, which means people pay more tax as more and more people are pushed into higher tax brackets if wages rise.MajorityA party with a majority – more than half of the seats in the House of Commons – has won the election.The number of votes by which an individual MP wins a constituency is also referred to as their majority.ManifestoPolitical parties publish manifestos before a general election, with a set of policies that the party stands for and aims to implement if elected.Manifesto pledges are not legally binding.Marginal seatA seat in which the incumbent MP won by a small majority, meaning a swing is more likely than in a so-called ‘safe seat’ where the MP had a large majority.Net zeroThe UK Government has set a goal for Britain’s emissions to reach net zero – where emission and removal of greenhouse gases reaches equilibrium – by 2050.All major parties are expected to stick to this goal, barring Reform UK.Opinion pollAn opinion poll is a research survey (usually carried out on a representative sample of the electorate) to gauge likely results in an election.Poll‘The polls’ refers to the places where people vote in an election: exit polls and opinion polls refer to two kinds of survey used to predict election results.Postal voteAn absentee vote where the vote is sent in by post.At the 2019 general election, 17.2% of voters across the UK used a postal ballot.Proxy voteA vote where a person who can’t make it to the booth appoints someone to vote for them.In the 2019 election, 0.6% of voters appointed a proxy.PsephologyPsephology is the scientific study of elections and voting and is used to predict and analyse election results.Polling dayThe day when the country places their vote: in the UK 2024 election, this is July 4.PurdahBefore British elections, the country enters purdah, officially known as the ‘pre-election period of sensitivity’.Purdah means that politicians (both local and national) and other people such as civil servants face restrictions on what they can do and announce.Ministers who remain in office can’t announce new funding, or new policies, or anything which might sway voters or make the government more popular.The idea is that public money cannot be spent on the election.Spoiled ballotA ballot paper which has been marked wrongly (for instance with a vote for more than one candidate) will not be counted.Sometimes people spoil ballots deliberately as a protest vote to show dissatisfactionSwing‘Swing’ is the change in voter support for a political party between one election and the next.It is used to analyse the performance of parties in different areas.Tax burdenThe tax burden refers to the total amount of taxes paid by a group (in this case the UK as a whole) as a proportion of total income.The tax burden is currently at its highest in 70 years according to the OECD.The Equality ActThe 2010 Equality Act protects people against discrimination in Britain.The Conservatives want to ‘tweak’ the Act so that sex-based protections only apply on the basis of someone’s biological sex.Triple lockThe triple lock is a guarantee introduced to the state pension in 2010 so it would not lose value in real terms.The guarantee means that the state pension will rise by the highest out of average earnings, inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) or 2.5%.Triple lock plusThe ‘triple lock plus’ is a Conservative policy, which would see the tax-free pension allowance rise every year in line with the triple lock of average wages, inflation, or 2.5% – whichever is highest, to prevent pensioners being pulled into paying income tax.TurnoutTurnout refers to the percentage of people eligible to vote who turn out to vote on election day.In the 2019 election, for example, 67.3% of those eligible turned out to vote.VATValue added tax is added to goods and services sold by VAT-registered companies, and is the third-largest source of government income after income tax and national insurance.Both Labour and the Conservatives have pledged not to raise VAT.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

The Guardian,Starmer says people would not be sent back to Afghanistan under returns policy,[],Jessica Elgot Deputy political editor,27 June 2024 at 7:02 am·3-min read,27,June,2024,07:02:00,3,"Keir Starmer has admitted for the first time that he would not return people to Afghanistan, after a bitter exchange in Wednesday night’s debate where Rishi Sunak mocked him for planning to “sit down with the ayatollahs” to negotiate return agreements.Starmer has repeatedly said he plans to negotiate returns agreements with safe countries in order to clear the asylum backlog, which has worsened due to the government’s recent legislation which does not allow asylum seekers to be processed while it waits to start deportations to Rwanda.Asked on Thursday whether he could rule out sending people back to Afghanistan, Starmer said: “There are some things that are not sensible for the asylum policy. That was a throwaway comment from the prime minister himself who had no answer to that question.“But leaving those claims unprocessed is not the answer to that. Of course there will be countries, Afghanistan for example, where you can’t return people – people who perhaps helped us by interpreting for our troops in Afghanistan and put themselves at risk. People who in my constituency were fleeing war in Afghanistan and found we weren’t able to get them out on those flights.default“Of course, in relation to their particular cases they’re not going to be returned to Afghanistan. But what we can’t do is stay with this absurd situation where there’s just a growing and growing number to which the prime minister has got absolutely no answer. It is absurd and reckless, the position he’s taken this country.”Starmer, who was speaking on a campaign visit to a college in Burton upon Trent, has also been criticised for comments he made in a Sun debate last week which caused a backlash in the British Bangladeshi community.He said he had not intended comments about a returns agreement with Bangladesh to cause any anxiety in the community. “My first trip as a Labour MP was to Bangladesh where I saw for myself the strength of the county, hospitality and warmth of the country,” he said.“The reference in the debate the other day was an example of a country that is considered safe as far as asylum concerns and one of the countries that actually has a returns agreement with us. I certainly wasn’t intending to cause any concern or offence to any Bangladeshi community here.”Speaking to reporters at the visit, the Labour leader appeared to contradict claims from his own activists that the party was pulling resources out of Clacton in the fight against Nigel Farage, including telling its own candidate there to go elsewhere.Starmer said the campaign would continue and there was no strategy to give the Tories space to defeat Farage. “We’re not backing down in Clacton, we’re not backing down anywhere across the country,” he said. “We have to fight in Clacton of course we do. We’ve got an excellent candidate there, he actually works for me, he’s fantastic.“So I’m very supportive of both him and the campaign that he’s running. He’s doing something incredible which is being that positive candidate in difficult circumstances.”"

PA Media: UK News,What are the ‘bellwether’ seats at the General Election?,[],"Ian Jones, PA",27 June 2024 at 3:29 am·3-min read,27,June,2024,03:29:00,3,"The election results in a handful of seats in England will be watched particularly closely, because of their status as “bellwethers”.– What are bellwether seats?In general elections, constituencies where the local result has a habit of matching the overall national outcome are known as bellwethers.They are seats that have a pattern of changing hands only when the government itself changes hands.A small number of constituencies have been bellwethers for decades, and as such are watched with interest for what they may – or may not – suggest about the outcome of the entire election.– Which seat has the longest record for being a bellwether?Dartford in Kent.Since 1964, whichever party wins Dartford has also gone on to form the government.At this election, Conservative candidate Gareth Johnson is defending a notional majority in Dartford of 14,704.(PA Graphics)It is described as a notional majority, because it is what Mr Johnson is likely to have won in 2019 had that contest taken place using the new constituency boundaries that have been introduced across the UK for the 2024 election.– Is Dartford likely to keep its bellwether status at this election? Were Labour to form the next government, Dartford would remain a bellwether only if it too was won by Sir Keir Starmer’s party.Labour needs a direct swing in the share of the vote of 15.9 percentage points to gain Dartford from the Conservatives.This is the equivalent of a net change of 16 in every 100 people who voted Tory last time switching sides.The swing is large enough to rank Dartford at number 185 on Labour’s list of targets, making it the type of seat likely to change hands if the party was heading for a landslide victory.– What are the next longest-running bellwethers?Three seats have been bellwethers at every general election since February 1974: Loughborough, Northampton North and Watford.All three are top Labour targets at this election, and the Tories would lose them to Sir Keir’s party on swings of 5.9 percentage points, 3.9 points and 1.4 points respectively.Watford ranks at number nine on Labour’s target list, while Northampton North is 38th and Loughborough is 61st.(PA Graphics)Worcester has been a bellwether since 1979.At the 1997 general election, attracting the support of so-called “Worcester Woman” was considered by Labour to be vital for victory nationwide.At this election, Labour needs a swing of 6.7 points to take Worcester from the Conservatives, ranking it at number 70 on the party’s target list.Sir Keir held two campaign events in Worcester soon after the election was called.Two other seats have been bellwethers since 1979: Harrow East and Gloucester.Harrow East in north London would need a swing of 8.6 percentage points for Labour to gain it from the Conservatives, while Gloucester would need one of 9.7 points.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has twice visited Harrow East since the start of the election campaign."

Latest polls and oddsFive new polls have been published, all of which show Labour holding a large lead over the Conservatives.","['No major changes show Labour on course for large victory', 'Tories could slump to lowest number of seats', 'What are the latest odds?', 'What went wrong for the Tories?']",James Cheng-Morris and  James Hockaday,Updated 27 June 2024 at 9:27 am·6-min read,27,June,2024,09:27:00,6,"With little over a week to go until the general election, five separate opinion polls continue to show a large Labour lead over the Conservatives.Prime minister Rishi Sunak will have been hoping to make a dent in Labour’s position but the campaign has been far from perfect for the Tories. It is now looking ever-more likely that Sir Keir Starmer will be prime minister by next Friday.Nigel Farage may yet have a good election night as Reform UK are currently in third place in the polls. The polling for the party has slipped following the controversy over Farage’s comments about the war in Ukraine but the party is still some five percentage points ahead of the Lib Dems.There was even further grim reading for the Tories on 26 June, when a separate poll conducted by Ipsos for the Evening Standard claimed that a record seven out of 10 Britons do not like the Conservative Party.Yahoo News UK summaries the positions of the parties according to five separate opinion polls.No major changes show Labour on course for large victoryA poll by Savanta puts Labour on 42% – 21 points ahead of the Tories, who are on 21%. Ipsos also puts Labour on 42%, compared to 19% for the Tories, while JL Partners give similar results, with Labour on 41% and the Tories on 25%.A Verian poll shows Labour on 38%, with the Tories on 21%, while Survation show Labour on 41%, compared to a historic low of 18% for the Tories.An average of opinion polls from February to June this year. (PA)An average of all polls with survey work completed during the seven days to 26 June puts Labour on 41%, 21 points ahead of the Conservatives on 20%, followed by Reform on 16%, the Lib Dems on 11% and the Greens on 6% – unchanged on the figures for the previous week.On 22 May, the day Sunak called the election, the seven-day averages stood at Labour 45%, Conservatives 23%, Reform 11%, Lib Dems 9% and Greens 6%.Tories could slump to lowest number of seatsEarlier this month, three major polls showed the Tories were on course for a historic defeat, with one projection showing the party potentially slumping to the lowest number of seats since the party was formed.Using the multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP) technique, which enables projections to be made at constituency level, YouGov's polling for Sky News projected Labour being on course to achieve a 200-seat majority. The poll suggested Labour would secure 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.The YouGov poll for Sky News.A More In Common UK poll for the News Agents podcast showed Labour projecting to finish on 406 seats, with the Conservatives on 155.Meanwhile, polling by Savanta and Electoral Calculus for the Telegraph, showed Sunak could become the first sitting prime minister to lose his seat of Richmond and Northallerton to Labour. It put Labour on 516 seats, with the Tories on just 53.What are the latest odds?As of 26 June, Oddschecker – a website which compares odds across different bookmakers – had Labour at 1/41 to win the most seats. To put that in context, this is seen as so likely that a £10 bet would return just £10.24.The Conservatives are 80/1 to win the most seats, a scenario seen as so unlikely that a £10 punt would return £810.A Conservative majority government is also seen as so unlikely (125/1) that Oddschecker sees a Reform UK government as more likely (100/1).What went wrong for the Tories?YouGov's voting intention tracker between January 2020 and June 2024. (YouGov)So, why have the polls changed so dramatically? It's worth looking back on an extremely eventful four-and-a-half years in UK politics.According to YouGov's voting intention tracker (see chart, above), Tory support peaked at 53%, with Labour on 32%, in April 2020, months after the party's stunning success in the 2019 general election and Boris Johnson's pledge to “get Brexit done”. That month also saw Starmer take over as Labour leader from Jeremy Corbyn.This was also amid a spirit of national unity following the onset of the COVID pandemic which nearly killed Johnson himself. The then-PM had been released from hospital five days before this particular survey was taken.Boris Johnson delivers his final speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street in September 2022. (AFP via Getty Images)Over the rest of the year, there was a downturn in support amid chaos over COVID rules, with the Tories falling as low as 35% in November 2020, compared to Labour on 40%.However, the UK’s successful COVID vaccination programme provided a pathway out of lockdown and with it, improved poll ratings. Tory support peaked at 41% in June 2021, with Labour at 30%.In October that year, there was a sense Johnson was untouchable. At the Tory party conference, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg remarked how the PM was ""in total command of his party, and politically dominant in the country"".But this fell apart quickly with the Partygate scandal, which emerged in November that year. Time and again, reports emerged of government and Tory staff – including Johnson – having taken part in lockdown-era social gatherings when their own COVID rules had prohibited them.By January 2022, Tory support had plummeted to 28%, with Labour on 38%. Johnson struggled on, but never recovered and a wave of ministerial resignations forced him to resign in July that year.The UK had three separate prime ministers – Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak – between 6 September and 24 October, 2022. (Getty Images)His successor, Liz Truss, then embarked on arguably the most disastrous prime ministerial reign in history, characterised by the catastrophic ""mini-budget"", containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, which prompted an economic crisis. Like Johnson, she lost the confidence of Tory MPs – and voters – and had to resign.Her 49-day spell as PM was the shortest in history, with Tory support plummeting to 19% (with Labour on 56%) the day after she announced her resignation in October 2022.Rishi Sunak, who had lost to Truss in the previous month's Tory leadership election, took over. However, as the above YouGov chart indicates, he has failed to cut through with voters. Tory support was at 23% two days after he assumed office, with the most recent survey, carried out on Thursday, showing support is now lower than under Truss at 18%.In short, the polls and odds, not to mention other factors such as notable by-election victories for Starmer's Labour, are pointing to a Labour government next week.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

The Telegraph,Reform candidate ‘said he wanted to slaughter migrants and have their family taken out’,[],Charles Hymas,26 June 2024 at 10:59 am·2-min read,26,June,2024,10:59:00,2,"A Reform UK candidate has reportedly said he would “slaughter” migrants arriving on small boats.Leslie Lilley, 70, who is forecast to secure almost 20 per cent of the vote in Southend East and Rochford, Essex, allegedly made the threat on the official Facebook account he uses to run his local campaign.Reacting to the news of small boat arrivals in a post in June 2020, he is reported to have said: “I hope I’m near one of these scumbags one day I won’t run away I’ll slaughter them then have their family taken out.”The same month, Mr Lilley reportedly hit out at “more scum entering the UK”, adding: “I hope your family get robbed, beaten or attacked.”According to The Times, he also suggested Border Force vessels should have razor wire to tear small boats carrying migrants across the Channel. Under a video of Muslims praying, he is said to have commented “gas” with several laughing emojis.Mr Lilley previously argued that the pandemic was a plan to “depopulate the world” and was “mass murder by government”.He is one of the 41 Reform UK candidates who are “friends” on Facebook with Gary Raikes, a former organiser for the British National Party who founded the New British Union in the image of Oswald Mosley’s British Union of Fascists, with activists who call themselves blackshirts.Mr Lilley is the latest candidate to be exposed for appearing to make extreme comments. Nigel Farage, the Reform leader, has blamed the party’s vetting company and has threatened legal action against them.The vetting company has blamed the timing of the election for its inability to complete the checks in time.Reform has dropped and replaced several candidates for controversial comments on social media, though only one candidate has been suspended since formal nominations closed on June 7.Grant StClair-Armstrong, who is standing against Kemi Badenoch in the North West Essex constituency, will still appear on the ballot paper along with the Reform UK name, but if elected he would be an independent.He was dropped by the party after comments found by The Times in which he called on people to vote for the BNP.Reform did not comment despite three requests to do so. It has previously said that its candidates are “not party political zombies” and that the party was “proud that they think and speak like the ordinary people they are”.A spokesman has previously said that candidates “have views of their own and are as free to express them as anyone else, even if they are not shared by all their party colleagues”.Mr Lilley has been contacted for comment."
Yahoo News UK,Who is Ed Davey? Lib Dem leader attracts attention with election stuntsEverything you need to know about the former minister who has pledged to fight for the NHS.,[],Hannah Fearn,7 June 2024 at 8:47 am·7-min read,7,June,2024,08:47:00,7,"Ed Davey has been involved in a number of comedy stunts since the election was called. (Alamy) With the spotlight on prime minister Rishi Sunak and Labour leader Keir Starmer as they prepare to slug it out in a general election campaign, the focus had started slipping from Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey until a series of stunts put him back in the spotlight.The former coalition government cabinet minister - who lost his seat, punished by voters for getting into bed with the Tories, but then won it back again - is sending a clear message that he should not be overlooked.He’s had a long political career and the climax may still be ahead: if polls continue to shift away from the Conservatives at the current trajectory, there’s a slim possibility that, if the election is held in October, he could end up as Leader of the Opposition.So what do we know about the man behind the third party in British politics? Hannah Fearn finds out.His early lifeEd Davey was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on Christmas Day in 1965. He was the youngest of three boys, but lost his father at just four years old, and his mother followed over a decade later when he was in his mid-teens. She spent three years battling cancer, during which time he nursed his mother together with his grandmother and brother Henry.Once a keen Scout and Air Scout, he later remembers feeling “isolated” at school because of his caring responsibilities, which meant he couldn’t take part in after-school activities or sports. “The last 18 months she was bedridden and in a lot of pain. I’d spend hours on the bed, talking to her,” he said. Davey was with his mother when she died at Nottingham General Hospital, after being placed on an unsuited dementia ward.After both his parents had died, Davey was brought up by his maternal grandparents in the village of Eakring, though his grandfather died soon after. He spent much of his childhood and young adulthood close to his grandmother. “First of all, she was looking after me. Then we were looking after each other,” he said.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

Gasson stood in four elections but failed to win a seat and is now a councillor. The pair have two children, a son and daughter.Their son, born in 2007 and now a teenager, is disabled with a neurological condition. He attended special schools but is now educated at home with a tutor - a change that Davey said led to him becoming verbal for the first time. He has spoken about his anxiety about who will care for his son when he and his wife are no longer around. “It’s the thing that worries me more than anything else in my life,” he said.Gasson was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in 2012. She was well for many years following her diagnosis, but declined during lockdown and is working on recovering her physical strength.Liberal Democrats election broadcast shows Ed Davey with his son. (Liberal Democrats)His parentsHis father, John, was a solicitor and his mother, Nina, a teacher. Davey has described how he was inspired to study by his mother, who always wanted him to try hard academically and who he wanted to impress.His educationDavey attended the private Nottingham High School, the alma mater of former chancellor Kenneth Clarke. He became head boy, with Labour MP Ed Balls - who was studying in the year below - watching on. After school, he achieved a first class degree in philosophy, politics and economics at Jesus College, Oxford where he was junior common room president. After becoming an economics research for the Liberal Democrats he returned to study, reading for a master’s degree in economics at Birkbeck College, London.Ed Davey, pictured with his family. (Liberal Democrats)Why is he a sir?For three years, the Lib Dem leader was a member of the cabinet during the period of Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, holding the post of secretary of state for energy and climate change from 2012 to 2015. He was knighted in the 2016 New Year’s Honours for “political and public services”.Davey on... the cost of living crisisDavey has repeatedly attacked the government for failing to curb rapid inflation and the devastating effect it is having on household budgets. He called the Conservative Party “so out of touch they might as well be living on another planet”, and said he warned Jeremy Hunt “people are desperate for real help… but all the chancellor could offer is empty words and unfair tax hikes”. In particular, he has urged more action on food price inflation, which analysis from his own party found had risen 37 per cent in one year for the average weekly supermarket trip. He has promised to end energy hikes and abandoned his plan to add 1p to income tax to save the NHS because ordinary voters can no longer afford it.Davey on... the NHSThe Liberal Democrats have made the NHS a cornerstone of their policy platform for the last five years. In Davey’s words: “Voting Conservative is bad for your health.” He promises to reverse cuts to GP numbers and guarantee a doctor’s appointment when you need one, improve access to NHS dentistry and save lives by tackling ambulance call out delays. Davey blames the care crisis for deepening the problems of the health service and says his party would spend £5bn a year on a “care package” to ensure patients are discharged from hospital more quickly, freeing up bed space. However, there is little detail on how this would be financed without raising taxes on the wealthiest - which Davey has promised not to do in his push to poach disillusioned Tory voters.British Leader of the Liberal Democrats party Ed Davey arrives at the BBC Broadcasting House, for his appearance on 'Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg', in London, Britain, April 28, 2024. REUTERS/Maja SmiejkowskaDavey on... immigrationThe Lib Dem leader has been a long-standing advocate for refugee rights and critic of the government’s immigration policy. He has called for Conservative plans to deport failed asylum seekers to Rwanda a “cynical distraction” from the partygate crisis and the money would be better spent on measures to tackle the cost of living crisis. He added: “They’ve provided no evidence to suggest that this new policy will stop illegal smuggling, they’re not cracking down on the organised crime gangs, which is what you need to do.” He has called for a new right to work for refugees and asylum seekers, and major reform of the Home Office which he says is no longer up to the job. After the end of the coalition government, Davey has said his party “was wrong” to go along with the introduction of a minimum income standard for immigrants. He later described the policy as “nasty and unfair”.Davey on... the Post Office scandalDespite the Horizon scandal that led to the wrongful prosecution of more than 700 subpostmasters crossing the tenure of more than a dozen business secretaries, Ed Davey has recently taken the heat for failing to investigate the issue while he was in the job.It has emerged that Davey initially rejected a request to meet justice campaigner Alan Bates, and later accepted it only on the advice that it would be good for his PR. He has recently apologised for not acting earlier, admitting that he is sorry that he “did not see through Post Office lies” about the fault in the Horizon programme."

Some three-quarters of the Cabinet would lose their seats in that scenario – including Sunak.Were Sunak to lose his seat in Richmond (Yorks), it would make him the first prime minister in history to lose their seat in a general election, according to the Institute for Government. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is also facing a battle to hold on to his constituency, with the vote on a “knife edge”.Savanta spoke to around 18,000 people between 7 June and 18 June for their poll. If reflected in the election, Labour would be on course to win 516 seats, with a commanding Commons majority of 382.

Labour are a sitting at 27% but Reform UK are polling 30%.Allowing for margins of error and another two weeks of campaigning, the seat will be hotly contested between all three parties on 4 July.Jacob Rees-MoggJacob Rees-Mogg is on track to lose his seat at the general election. (PA)While no longer a government minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg losing his North East Somerset and Hanham seat would perhaps be one of the night’s bigger surprises. Rees-Mogg has been an outspoken critic of some of Sunak’s policies and is a regular presenter on GB News.However, the Ipsos poll has the seat, which has been newly-created for the 2024 election, is currently showing a “likely Labour” win, with the party on 47%, compared to 30% for the Conservatives.Johnny MercerPolling suggests Johnny Mercer will lose his seat to Labour at the election.

The Telegraph,"Sunak and Starmer undermining Britain’s energy security, says oil company","['State of constant uncertainty', '‘Jobs will be lost’']",Jonathan Leake,27 June 2024 at 7:56 am·3-min read,27,June,2024,07:56:00,3,"oilRishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer are destroying the offshore oil industry and undermining Britain’s energy security, a leading oil and gas company has said.David Latin, the chairman of Serica Energy, claimed that windfall taxes and political opposition had made Britain the most hostile country he had ever operated in outside of war zones.Mr Latin said: “I have been involved in this industry for more than 30 years and have worked all over the world.“Other than when I was responsible for a company which had significant assets in a war zone, I have never encountered a [political] situation which was so challenging when it comes to making investment decisions, and planning for the future more generally, as it is in the UK at present.”ADVERTISEMENTMr Latin said he was moving investments out of UK waters because the taxes and regulations imposed on the industry were too onerous and kept changing.State of constant uncertaintyHis comments, in a speech released in advance of Serica’s annual meeting today, were focused partly on the Conservative government, which first imposed a windfall tax in the spring of 2022, and later increased the rate and extended its duration.These multiple changes, said Mr Latin, left the industry in a state of constant uncertainty and destroyed investor confidence.Those problems were compounded by Labour, which has pledged to raise the tax again while also stripping the industry of the investment allowances should it be elected.Such allowances, which allow companies to offset investment against profit, are common to all businesses, so removing them from a single industry would set a major precedent.Mr Latin said that oil and gas producers already pay tax at an overall tax rate of 75pc, three times that charged to UK companies in other industries.He said: “This is despite the period of so-called “windfall” conditions for UK producers having long passed, with oil and gas prices having returned to historically normal levels.Story continues“Yet in the current general election, no reduction to match the circumstances is proposed by the Conservative Party and yet another increase in the tax rate to 78pc is proposed by the Labour Party.“Hydrocarbons are not intrinsically evil. They have allowed our civilisation to escape the bounds of subsistence.“Welcome alternatives are being developed but we – not least in the UK – will continue to depend on hydrocarbons for decades to come.“Surely it is better to produce these responsibly under world leading regulatory oversight in this country, with all the attendant benefits in jobs and tax revenues, than to import hydrocarbons which often arrive with a higher environmental and social cost than domestic production.”‘Jobs will be lost’Mr Latin warned that the policies and taxes imposed by UK politicians would rapidly lead to falling flows of oil and gas.He said: “Oil and gas continue to flow only when the main supply of investment stays open. Without it, the flow dries up. Even existing oil and gas fields decline and need continuous investment to maintain production.“Without investment fields will start to shut in and there will be a domino effect in the interconnected and interdependent UK North Sea infrastructure. …  Oil and gas consumption in the UK will be reduced not one iota, but UK jobs will be lost, imports increased, overall emissions raised, tax receipts for the Exchequer actually reduced, and the country’s security weakened.”He also warned that the recent Supreme Court decision requiring planning authorities to take account of downstream emissions in the approvals process for oil and gas fields would also drive the industry out of UK waters.Mr Latin said: “The choice is not between UK oil and gas or no oil and gas; the choice is UK oil and gas or foreign oil and gas. As was stated in the Supreme Court decision, emissions respect no borders.”"
HuffPost UK,Rishi Sunak In Angry Clash With Sky News Journalist Over Tory Betting Scandal,[],Kevin Schofield,27 June 2024 at 9:16 am·2-min read,27,June,2024,09:16:00,2,"A frustrated PM. A frustrated interviewer.The PM responding to news Scotland Yard could interview candidates under caution within days pic.twitter.com/CngkuCwf70— Sam Coates Sky (@SamCoatesSky) June 27, 2024Rishi Sunak clashed with a Sky News journalist as he repeatedly dodged questions about the Tory betting scandal.The prime minister refused to say whether he had told one of the Conservative candidates under investigation by the Gambling Commission, Craig Williams, the date of the election before announcing it publicly.Williams was Sunak’s parliamentary aide and is one of his closest political allies.He and another candidate, Laura Saunders, were ditched by the party earlier this week over claims they put bets on the day of the election.On the campaign trail today, Sky News’ deputy political editor Sam Coates asked the PM: “Did you tell Craig Williams, a man you said you were with almost every minute of every day, the date of the election before he put the bet on?”Sunak replied: “Sam, I’ve been clear about this. I was furious when I learned about these allegations. We’ve initiated independent inquiries of our own because I don’t have access to the Gambling Commission’s detail.“We’ve suspended candidates. You’ll recognise, whilst there are ongoing independent investigations ... it’s just not right for me to say anything more about that.“But, if anyone has broken the rules, of course they should face the full consequences of the law and I’ll ensure that they’re booted out of the party.”Coates then said: “Prime minister, you know the answer to the question whether or not you told Craig Williams. You cannot prejudice an investigation, you can only prejudice a jury trial. You absolutely can answer this question.”The PM replied: “No it’s absolutely not right, while there are independent investigations that those aren’t compromised in any way, shape or form.”As Coates tried to challenge him Sunak continued: “They are rightly confidential and it’s important that they stay that way and that’s the right thing to do, and you know that.”Coates then hit back: “That is not true, you can only prejudice a jury trial. You know the answer of whether you told Craig Williams - yes or no?”Talking over the journalist, Sunak said: “We have done internal inquiries of our own, and as a result of those we have suspended candidates.“I’ve been clear that anyone who’s broken rules should face the full force of the law. I will ensure they are booted out of the party, and whilst there are ongoing, independent investigations, including by the police, it’s important that those matters are allowed to proceed properly.”Related...A Tory Candidate Has Been Accused Of Betting £8,000 That He Will Lose His SeatA Tory Candidate At The Centre Of A Betting Scandal Has Begged Voters To Stand By HimTory Party Drops Candidates Accused Of Betting On General Election Date"
The Telegraph,Sunak refuses to confirm whether he told aide election date before bet,[],Martin Evans,27 June 2024 at 8:15 am·4-min read,27,June,2024,08:15:00,4,"Rishi Sunak has refused to confirm whether he told a parliamentary aide the date of the election before he placed a bet on it.Two weeks ago, Craig Williams admitted he had a “flutter” on the election date. Mr Williams had been reselected by the Tories to contest Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr, which he won in 2019, before the party withdrew its support on Tuesday.During an election campaign visit to Derbyshire, Mr Sunak was asked repeatedly whether he had confided in Mr Williams ahead of his surprise announcement of a summer election.Speaking to broadcasters, the Prime Minister said: “I’ve been clear about this. I’m furious to have learnt about these allegations.“We’ve initiated independent inquiries of our own, because I don’t have access to the Gambling Commission’s detail. You’ll recognise that while there are ongoing independent investigations it’s just not right for me to say anything more about that.”Told he could not prejudice the investigation, Mr Sunak refused twice more to say whether he had told Mr Williams the election date.It came as Scotland Yard suggested Tory politicians could face police investigation over bets placed on the date of the general election.The Metropolitan Police is taking over part of the investigation and will assess whether any offences, such as misconduct in public office, have been committed.Detectives from the Met’s specialist crime command will determine what further investigation is required, a spokesman for the force said.Scotland Yard said the investigation would be split into two parts, with the Gambling Commission continuing to examine allegations of alleged cheating and the police focusing on whether any additional criminal offences had been committed.This could potentially include allegations of misconduct in public office against Conservative politicians who placed bets that Mr Sunak would call a July election.But the timing of the Met’s announcement has caused anger among Tory officials, who believe it could influence voters in the final week of campaigning.It also comes days after Scotland Yard was forced to deny reports in The Telegraph that it had been accused of leaking the identities of Conservatives implicated in the betting scandal.One serving Met officer, who is a member of Rishi Sunak’s close protection team, has already been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office.A further six officers have been identified as having placed bets on the timing of the election, but so far their cases are being investigated by the Gambling Commission.It is not clear how many people are being investigated over potential criminal offences, but Scotland Yard said the number was likely to be much smaller than those being looked into for alleged cheating.A Met spokesman said: “The Gambling Commission continues to review whether any bets placed on the timing of the general election will be within scope of either investigation.“The Met has compared the names of those who have placed bets on the timing of the election against a list of their officers. So far, seven officers have been identified.“One, a PC attached to the Royalty and Specialist Protection Command, was arrested on Monday June 17 on suspicion of misconduct in public office. The officer has been bailed and is subject to restricted duties.“A further six officers have been identified as having placed bets on the timing of the election. The Gambling Commission continues to investigate these matters, but the Met’s Directorate of Professional Standards is being kept informed.”Andrew Rhodes, the chief executive of the Gambling Commission, said: “We are focused on an investigation into confidential information being used to gain an unfair advantage when betting on the date of the general election.“Our enforcement team has made rapid progress so far, and will continue to work closely with the Metropolitan Police to draw this case to a just conclusion.“We understand the desire for information – however, to protect the integrity of the investigation and to ensure a fair and just outcome, we are unable to comment further at this time, including the name of any person who may be under suspicion.”Detective Superintendent Katherine Goodwin, who is leading the Met investigation, said: “We have agreed a joint approach with the Gambling Commission, who are the appropriate authority to investigate the majority of these allegations.“There will, however, be a small number of cases where a broader criminal investigation by the police is required. We will aim to provide updates at key points as our investigation progresses.”"
Yahoo News UK,"Three important UK election issues, explainedRishi Sunak said his leadership is needed in 'uncertain' times. Keir Starmer said the country needs to be 'rebuilt'. So what issues do voters care about most?","['The economy', 'Health', 'Immigration and asylum']",James Cheng-Morris,Updated 28 May 2024 at 9:11 am·5-min read,28,May,2024,09:11:00,5,"After months of speculation, Rishi Sunak confirmed the general election will be held on 4 July.The prime minister said Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer could not be trusted to lead the country through “uncertain” times. He made the economy and combating global security the key elements of his pitch to the nation as he announced the election date.In response, Starmer told voters: “Together we can stop the chaos, we can turn the page, we can start to rebuild Britain.”But amid this “uncertainty” and need to “rebuild”, what do the voters consider the key issues?This chart, produced using YouGov polling over the course of this parliament, offers an insight in the issues voters care most about and how that has ebbed and flowed over time.Compared to when Boris Johnson's Tories won the December 2019 poll, the economy, immigration, defence and tax have grown in importance in the eyes of the electorate. This has come amid the cost of living crisis; small boats crossing the English Channel; the onset of the Ukraine war and wider global instability; and the highest tax burden in 70 years.Housing has also become a bigger concern, with the Renters Reform Bill - in which the government pledged to scrap no-fault evictions - having been paused after Sunak called the election.Meanwhile, the last general election was fought - and won by the Tories - on a single issue: Brexit. Yet the chart shows a clear downturn in its relevance among voters, particularly after a trade deal was agreed with the EU in December 2020.This next chart, meanwhile, highlights what voters have considered the top issues over the past year. By a wide margin, the top three are the economy, health and immigration and asylum.Here, Yahoo News UK breaks down what is behind these issues and how they have ebbed and flowed in importance among voters since the last election in 2019.The economyThe unprecedented lockdown called by Boris Johnson in March 2020 meant the public’s attention shifted to the economy, as demonstrated by the huge spike in the chart above. The then-chancellor Rishi Sunak was forced to implement a £70bn furlough scheme, lasting 18 months, to protect people’s jobs.There was a second almighty economic shock - and rise in public concern - in February 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This caused a further spike in an already turbulent wholesale energy market, driving up costs for suppliers and ultimately customers.Average energy bills eventually reached £2,500 a year (and would have exceeded £4,000 had the government not intervened). This was double the £1,278 consumers were paying before the war and by the time this election takes place, people will still be paying much more than this: £1,568.Energy prices were also a key driver in inflation reaching 11.1% - a 41-year high - by October 2022, though it has since fallen to 2.3%, which is near the Bank of England’s 2.0% target.The third economic shock of this parliament - and most damaging for the Tories - was in October 2022 when Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng's disastrous “mini budget”, containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, prompted an economic crisis. It led to soaring interest rates, and to this day homeowners who are remortgaging are facing significantly higher bills.HealthHealth, like the economy, is another issue which clearly correlated with the beginning of the pandemic. The above chart shows an enormous spike in public concern when COVID cases started to multiply in March 2020, ultimately leading to the nationwide lockdown as the NHS faced collapse.Cases fell that summer, but spikes in the chart can be seen once infections rose again and fresh nationwide lockdowns were imposed in October 2020 and January 2021. By March 2022, likely as concerns over the Omicron variant faded, there was much less concern about health.In January last year, there was a brief spike as the NHS in England experienced the biggest industrial action in its history, with tens of thousands of nurses and ambulance staff walking out simultaneously.As for the state of play going into the election, NHS waiting lists remain higher than they were when Sunak vowed to cut them last year. According to the latest figures, an estimated 7.54 million treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of March, relating to 6.29 million patients.Immigration and asylumSince the last election, the immigration and asylum narrative has largely revolved around one issue: small boats crossing the English Channel.The numbers have risen in most of the intervening years: there were 1,843 crossings in 2019, 8,466 in 2020, 28,526 in 2021, 45,774 in 2022 and 29,437 last year. This year, the number has already passed the 10,000 mark.The regular sharp spikes in the above chart demonstrate how frequently crossings have been in the news, including some occasions when hundreds of migrants have made the dangerous journey in a single day.But it also reflects how the government has made this part of its own agenda. It was Boris Johnson’s government which first announced plans to deport migrants to Rwanda in April 2022. That policy was picked up by Rishi Sunak when he became prime minister in October that year, with Sunak since repeating his pledge to “stop the boats”.But after calling the election, Sunak admitted this week that flights would not take off before the country goes to the polls.Read moreFive important laws that could be dropped due to Sunak's snap election (Yahoo News UK)OPINION - Rishi Sunak has been in last-ditch campaign mode for so long — a General Election is logical (Evening Standard)Door open for Boris Johnson to campaign for Tories, Rishi Sunak signals (PA Media)"

Our enforcement team has made rapid progress so far and will continue to work closely with the Metropolitan police to draw this case to a just conclusion.”Det Supt Katherine Goodwin, who is leading the Met investigation, said: “We have agreed a joint approach with the Gambling Commission, who are the appropriate authority to investigate the majority of these allegations.

The Telegraph,John Swinney blames Margaret Thatcher for Scotland’s woes in last desperate election shot,[],Alan Cochrane,27 June 2024 at 9:16 am·3-min read,27,June,2024,09:16:00,3,"John Swinney has fired the only decent shot he has left in his depleted general election armoury when he named the person who’s most to blame for all of Scotland’s ills.No, not Nicola Sturgeon, although there are plenty in the SNP who’d happily lay the blame at her door. Not even Alex Salmond or Humza Yousaf, respectively her predecessor and successor as first minister.No, it’s all down to the woman who he reckons all but destroyed Scotland 40 years ago: Margaret Thatcher.As an example of not just the politics of absurdity but also –  certainly in Mr Swinney’s and the SNP’s case – of the politics of desperation.Douglas Ross, the erstwhile Scottish Tory leader, delivered a litany of nationalist failures since 2007, which included the highest drug deaths in Europe, increased alcohol-linked deaths, massive NHS waiting lists and a life expectancy for Scots now less than it had been 17 years ago. He demanded Swinney stopped making independence his sole priority.But the First Minister responded by insisting that independence was the only solution to Tory-inspired austerity before reaching for his obviously carefully prepared coup de grace where he insisted: “We have to understand the consequences of the devastation wreaked on our country by the policies of Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative government.”To fall back on that tired and, frankly, lamebrained excuse that Maggie is to blame for everything that’s going wrong in Scotland, suggests that Swinney has been spending too much time poring over the latest opinion polls and trying to come up with an new excuse for the significant cull of his 48 MPs expected next Thursday.It was all about what Thatcher did to Scotland in the 1980s, which led to Ross describing as “absurd” the idea that everything that’s now wrong in Scotland was the result of policies adopted before he (Ross) had been born.He was born in 1983, four years after Thatcher became prime minister so I suppose, in Swinney’s eyes, that makes him one of “Maggie’s bairns” but his linking of Scotland’s current problems with, what is ancient political history, is a sure sign that Swinney is clutching at straws as July 4 draws ever nearer.While it’s true that Ross is a football referee and used to being blamed for all manner of wrong-doing it’s a bit much to link him with Maggie’s sins – real or imagined.In what was the last Question Time before Holyrood goes on holiday – sorry recess – Swinney was given a bruising from Anas Sarwar, the Labour leader. He reminded the First Minister of what must rank as one of the most embarrassing and, frankly, appalling episodes in the SNP’s oversight of the NHS,Because of long waiting times, some cancer patients in Scotland are actually paying for their own chemotherapy treatment. Sarwar said that the SNP had failed to meet the 62-day standard for cancer treatment for twelve years, meaning that almost 26, 000 cancer patients had waited too long.Cancer patients paying for their own treatment. Surely nothing sums up the SNP’s failure on the NHS than that. And it has absolutely nothing to do with Margaret Thatcher."
Yahoo News UK,"Who is Richard Tice? Reform’s former leader turned Farage sidekickThe candidate for Hartlepool has seen his party's popularity swell in recent months, with one poll showing reform ahead of the Conservatives.",[],Andrew Naughtie,Updated 14 June 2024 at 3:45 am·6-min read,14,June,2024,03:45:00,6,"Now that Nigel Farage has taken over as the leader of Reform UK, Richard Tice’s public profile is fading fast - but the Reform chairman remains involved in the party's operations.So far, the party has only one MP, Conservative defector Lee Anderson. But a recent poll has shown Reform overtaking the Tories, raising the possibility Anderson could hold his seat and even end up with fellow Reformers in the next Parliament.As the candidate for Hartlepool, where he stood as the Brexit Party candidate in 2019, Tice hopes to be one of them. So who is he, and what does he stand for?Childhood and educationBorn in Surrey in 1964 to James Tice, a showjumper, and Joan Tice, a horse trainer. Educated at the private boarding school Uppingham, he studied at the University of Salford, gaining a degree in construction economics and quantity surveying – teeing him up for a career that he said would ""continue the family genes in the property industry"".Family (partner & kids)Tice has three children from a 24-year marriage that ended in divorce. He is now in a long-term relationship with the right-wing writer and journalist Isabel Oakeshott.She is perhaps best known for two notorious incidents that set her against leading Tories: a book that featured the heavily disputed allegation that David Cameron had engaged in sexual activity with a pig, and the release of embarrassing messages entrusted to her by Matt Hancock when she agreed to write a book with him.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election? Full list mappedThe key issues that will decide the electionWhen is the first UK general election TV debate?What is purdah? The strict rule that governs what politicians can and can't sayNet worthWhile not quite in the same league as Rishi Sunak, Tice is one of the wealthiest people in British politics. As he describes it on his website, he made his multi-million-pound fortune over the course of “30 years of making things happen in property investment”, starting with a graduate job at a London firm in 1987.According to Tice, the company he leads as CEO, Quidnet Capital, has “bought and managed £500 million in commercial properties across the UK on behalf of clients”.He was also a key figure in the redevelopment of London’s Nine Elms district, near Battersea Power Station, a controversial project that has transformed a stretch of the Thames’s south bank with a welter of rapidly erected high-rise blocks.GB News linksAlong with Nigel Farage, Lee Anderson and several MPs on the right flank of the Tory party, Tice is a regular on the hard-right, culture war-focused TV outlet GB News. There he hosts a programme called “Richard Tice’s Sunday Sermon”, which serves as a platform for him to deliver his political analysis without the interruptions of an interviewer.However, despite the network being a relatively safe space for him in ideological terms, Tice’s appearances aren’t always amicable. A recent interview with host Andrew Pierce, a longtime right-wing commentator, saw him challenged fiercely about Reform’s chances in a summer election should one be called – with Pierce pointing to the “weirdos” selected by the party to fight numerous seats as evidence the party is “not ready”.Richard Tice, pictured in 2018 at a 'Leave Means Leave' campaign event, is focused on the issue of immigration. (Steve Finn/WENN)Tice was also involved in an incident that saw the network deemed in breach of broadcasting regulator Ofcom’s impartiality regulations, specifically an interview in which a former Brexit Party MEP failed to “sufficiently challenge” his views on immigration.The regulator is under increasing pressure to crack down on GB News heading into the election, with critics arguing it cannot be allowed to broadcast shows that feature Tory and Reform MPs interviewing each other without alternative points of view represented.Tice on NHSThe state and future of the NHS set to be one of this election’s main battlegrounds, and Reform’s key health policy is to spend £17 billion on the NHS on top of its current budget in an effort to get waiting lists down to zero. It also proposes introducing tax relief on private healthcare – something that has been criticised by opponents as a creeping step towards the privatisation of healthcare writ large.Tice’s stated rationale is that the reason the service is struggling is because the money it needs is being spent on other things that the public do not in fact support. Top of the list is Net Zero, which the party and its predecessors have long decried as a pointless “woke” project.In April, Tice used a press conference to frame the choice starkly. “We have a choice in this country, it seems to me,” he said. “A pretty clear choice. Do we want zero waiting lists in two years, and to keep them there? That is the Reform choice. Or do we want net zero CO2 emissions in 25 years? That is the Labour choice.”Tice on immigrationImmigration is by far Reform UK’s top issue, with the party looking to build on Farage’s two decades of campaigning against it in its legal and illegal forms.As far as the election goes, Tice and the party are targeting the continuing arrival of small boats of people travelling across the English Channel, many of them seeking asylum. He has criticised the government for failing to stop “mass immigration” post-Brexit, and described Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda policy as “a disaster”, arguing on GB News that its supposed deterrent value was revealed to be zero just hours after the House of Commons finally passed the law.Reform chairman Richard Tice (L) and leader Nigel Farage speak at the party's economic policy launch at Church House in London. (Alamy Live News)“Within a matter of hours more boats, absolutely packed full, overfilled with illegal migrants, were setting off from the beaches. And we learnt on Tuesday morning that sadly five people, including a young child, drowned leaving the beaches. That's not a deterrent. That's an absolute disaster.”Instead of deporting people to Rwanda, he is arguing for a “pick up and take back” policy that would see small boat arrivals deposited back on French soil. As evidence that this is both practical and humane, he has cited similar policies deployed in the US and Australia.However, he has not addressed the fact that Australia’s policy has been criticised internationally for leaving so-called “boat people” confined to facilities on the island of Nauru, where there have been incidents of suicide and self-immolation.Tice on cost of living crisisPerhaps unsurprisingly given he is trying to peel away former Tory voters, Tice has criticised recent Tory prime ministers harshly for overseeing Britain’s intense cost of living crisis. In 2022, he accused then-prime minister Boris Johnson of “waffling” over the situation. “Clueless, out of touch, no ideas, no help,” he tweeted. “Shocking.”He has also warned that the prospect of a “disastrous” Labour government will offer no prospect of meaningful relief for struggling households.Instead, Reform proposes lifting the minimum level of income tax to £20,000 while cutting various other taxes – among them fuel duty, another gesture to the party’s rejection of environmentalism as a top priority."
Yahoo News UK,"3 electoral maps that show how disastrous the election could be for the ToriesWith new modelling predicting a Labour victory even bigger than Tony Blair's 1997 landslide, the outlook for Rishi Sunak is not looking good.",['Which Tory ministers are at risk of losing their seats?'],James Cheng-Morris and  James Hockaday,Updated 5 June 2024 at 6:34 am·4-min read,5,June,2024,06:34:00,4,"The outlook was already looking bleak for the Conservative Party when Rishi Sunak called the general election following months of dismal approval ratings that showed little sign of improving.At a campaign event last week, Sunak said he didn't think defeat to Labour was a ""foregone conclusion"", suggesting his main election rival Sir Keir Starmer was taking the British electorate ""for granted"".However, a general election projection released on Monday will have added to the Tories' woes – predicting the biggest win for Labour in the party's history, surpassing even that of Tony Blair's 1997 landslide.The analysis, carried out by YouGov for Sky News, used a relatively new polling technique called Multi-level Regression and Post-stratification (MRP), which is regarded to have had a good track record and can provide detailed predictions at a constituency level basis. The scale of Sunak's problems is demonstrated by the interactive maps below, showing just how much ground the Tories are expected to lose compared to their 2019 victory.Click on the arrows in the top left to switch between the two maps. Check your own constituency to see if it is projected to change handsThe first map above shows the seats won in the 2019 general election, when Boris Johnson led the party to a stunning majority.The wall of Tory blue on the map, compared to the spots of Labour red, is a demonstration of just how far Labour, then led by Jeremy Corbyn, had fallen in public standing. The result was Labour's worst electoral performance since 1935.If you toggle to the second map, the projection by YouGov (which was based on polling carried out between 24 May - 1 June) suggests that Starmer's party is on track to win 422 seats, with the Tories down to just 140.Such a result would be the Conservative Party's worst performance at a general election since 1906. If YouGov's predictions are accurate, Labour winning a 194-seat majority would be the highest number since Conservative Stanley Baldwin won a majority of 208 in 1924.The model suggests the Conservatives could be set for near wipeout across many areas of the country, including London, the North East, the North West, and Wales.It also projects that the Scottish National Party would lose more than half their seats, with Labour returning as the largest party north of the border, and the Liberal Democrats reclaiming its place as the third party of British politics – winning 48 seats.The new figures, released yesterday, came as Reform UK co-founder Nigel Farage announced that he would be returning as the populist party's leader and would stand for election in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. Even before Farage's latest bid, pollsters told Yahoo News that Reform UK could pose a serious threat to the Tories by splitting the vote and potentially handing even more seats to Labour.The YouGov projection follows a similar poll by modelling site Electoral Calculus, which came out on 31 May. The polling also compares the 2019 result with Electoral Calculus' projection.It predicts that Labour is on course to win an even bigger majority of 319 seats - with Starmer's party picking up 485 MPs and the Tories way behind with 66. The modelling shows the Lib Dems getting very close to the Conservative Party, with 59 seats.While Electoral Calculus' polling, based on opinion polls from 8 May to 20 May, returns a different set of projections to YouGov's, both clearly indicate the scale of the problem facing Sunak.The Electoral Calculus model has predicted Sir Keir Starmer's Labour will win a massive majority.

They have two children, a son and daughter, but both are kept out of the public eye.Victoria's father was Jewish and originally came from Poland, while her mother converted when they got married. Starmer has said in a previous interview that ""my wife in particular wants our children to know the faith of her family"" and that they ""observe some of the practices, for example Friday night prayers"".Keir Starmer with parents, Rodney and Josephine, at his graduation. (Twitter/Keir Starmer)His parentsThe Labour leader's father, Rodney Starmer, worked as a toolmaker in a factory, and his mother Josephine Starmer (née Baker), was a nurse.His father worked long, 14-hour days but spent his time outside work caring for Josephine, who was diagnosed with the autoimmune condition Still’s disease. She required two hip and knee replacements twice in her lifetime and struggled with arthritic pain.As a young man Starmer also helped care for his mother, which he has said led to him being more emotionally reserved. His sister, Katy, recalled: “He’s had to be a grown-up all his life. I’ve always been quite open about my feelings – Keir is good at most things, but not that.” Josephine Starmer died in 2015, and his father three years later.His educationStarmer passed the 11-plus examination, and attended Reigate Grammar School from age 11. While he was at the school it became an independent fee-paying institution, but as an existing student he was exempt from fees, and his tuition in the sixth form was covered by a bursary.After school he studied law at the University of Leeds, this first in his family to attend university, graduating with a first class degree in 1985. He undertook postgraduate law studied at the University of Oxford, where he served as editor of a radical magazine, Socialist Alternatives.A photograph of a younger Starmer as shown on ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories in 2021. (ITV)Why is he a sir?Stamer was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 2014 in recognition of his work in the legal profession, culminating in a five-year term as Director of Public Prosecutions.He first became a barrister in 1987 at the Middle Temple, later joining Doughty Street Chambers and was appointed a Queen’s Counsel in 2002, aged just 39. In 2008 he was appointed head of the Crown Prosecution Service and DPP.During his tenure he chose to prosecute three Labour MPs and a Conservative in the wake of the parliamentary expenses scandal, and was responsible for prosecuting former MP Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce for perverting the course of justice after Pryce claimed responsibility for her former husband’s speeding offence.Starmer on... the NHSThe Labour leader has said that, if elected, his government would “get the NHS working around the clock and pay staff properly to do it”.The remark followed a commitment to provide £1.1bn in funding for the health service to cut waiting lists by paying doctors and nurses to carry out additional out-of-hours care, which would be funded by axing tax breaks for wealthy “non-doms” who hoard money overseas. He added: “The Conservative Party that brought our NHS to its knees will put it in the ground. We have to get it back on its feet.”Starmer describes the NHS as “the crowdfunded solution for all of us”, reinforcing his commitment to healthcare being free at the point of use, but says reform is inevitable or the health service would “remain on life support”. He has pledged to integrate up-to-date technology into every part of the NHS including using artificial intelligence to diagnose disease earlier and more accurately.He supported the doctors strikes, telling ministers: “Don’t break junior doctors, talk to them. Get in the room [and] sort it out.”Starmer with his wife, Lady Victoria Starmer, at the Labour Party Conference in October 2023. (Alamy)Starmer on… immigrationThe government has “lost control of borders”, according to Labour. Starmer has said a Labour government would set up a new policy unit to tackle illegal migration and has suggested that a returns agreement for asylum seekers could be negotiated with the European Union to solve the small boats crisis.He described the government’s thwarted Rwanda plan, which would see illegal migrants deported to the African nation but has to be put into practice due to legal blocks, as a “gimmick” and a “farce” and has promised to reverse it.Starmer on... the cost of living crisisStarmer has sought to keep Rishi Sunak’s handling of the cost of living crisis in the minds of voters by claiming that “his fingerprints are all over their struggling household budgets”. In a letter to his shadow cabinet, leaked to The Guardian, he wrote: “Rishi Sunak is the chief architect of choices prioritising the wealthiest and of the government’s failure to get a grip of the economy and get growth going.”He has said he would prioritise tackling inflation, blaming it for putting up prices and eroding household savings, but has pledged to “take the difficult and responsible decisions” to bring it down.Starmer pictured in 2010, when he was director of public prosecution at the CPS, making a statement about MPs who face charges over their expenses claims. (Getty)Starmer on... private schoolsLabour has dropped its early promise to scrap charitable status for private schools, but has committed to levying a 20% VAT rate on school fees removing their “unfair tax break”. The money raised, he said, will be used to address the “appalling state” of the school system for all children.“It’s not an attack on private schools. It’s just saying an exemption you have had is going to go,” he warned private schools who have been critical of the plan – reminding them they are not obliged to pass that tax on to parents in the form of increased fees.Starmer on… the House of LordsWhen he was first Labour leader, Starmer proposed a “root and branch reform of the centre of government… rooting out unearned privilege and addressing unaccountable power”.But his promise to scrap the House of Lords within the first four years of a new parliament - a controversial move that caused a split among his party’s grandees, has been abandoned.Starmer still backs plans for a second chamber “electoral legitimacy”, but as his party nears government he has stepped away from the most radical form of that pledge. He is now reportedly committed to cutting the number of hereditary peers, reducing the size of the chamber and introducing a new appointments process."
The Guardian,Labour ‘not putting up a fight’ against Farage in Clacton,[],Aletha Adu Political correspondent,26 June 2024 at 0:45 pm·4-min read,26,June,2024,00:45:00,4,"Labour has been accused of “not putting up a fight” against Nigel Farage in Clacton after the party’s candidate was instructed to leave the constituency after “distracting” from Keir Starmer’s campaign.Jovan Owusu-Nepaul, 27, who works for Labour’s equalities team, was installed by the party last month to contest the seat, weeks before Farage changed his mind and decided to stand in the Essex constituency.Owusu-Nepaul has since been “seconded” to the West Midlands, while the local campaign in Clacton said that it had been banned from printing leaflets, blocked from using campaigning software and had access to the campaign’s social media overriden, with posts deleted on X.Related: ‘He’s for English people’: Farage’s populist pitch gains traction in ClactonLabour regards Clacton as an unwinnable seat, with the party gaining just 15% of the vote in 2019, when the Tories won a 24,702 majority.Members of Clacton’s constituency Labour party (CLP) had been expecting a “well planned but low energy” social media campaign.However, Owusu-Nepaul attracted attention on social media after he was photographed bumping into the Reform UK leader at an opening of a new food truck in Frinton earlier this month, with pictures going viral.A campaign source said Labour headquarters had been angry with the traction Owusu-Nepaul was getting. “At one point [Jovan] was getting more retweets than Keir Starmer. The officials were furious with him and said he was distracting [from] Starmer’s campaign,” they said.The Guardian reported last week that dozens of Labour candidates have been blocked from accessing the party’s canvassing systems, which help them drum up support from voters, because they were deemed not to be campaigning enough in target seats.Tracey Lewis, a Labour activist from Clacton, quit the CLP after Owusu-Nepaul was sent to campaign in the West Midlands.She said: “I’m a lifelong Labour supporter and will continue to be even though I’ve quit my place on the CLP, but if they can’t put a fight up against Nigel Farage, then who are they fighting for?”Chris Bee, another member of the local party, said: “Our candidate gets some real traction and with a week-and-a-bit to go they pull him out and will not allow him back into the constituency to fight for a place in this area’s most important election in a generation. This is absolutely disgusting on every level.”In a letter to Labour’s general secretary, David Evans, seen by the Guardian, Martin Suker, Owusu-Nepaul’s election agent said: “Reform UK stands for everything we the Labour party stand against … and I’m struggling to come to terms that it appears the party doesn’t even want to be seen to be putting up a fight.“Jovan was told [by an official] to never come back to Clacton, and yesterday, was instructed to move to the West Midlands region.“I’m concerned there will be follow-on questions: members, supporters and more worryingly donators will be both angry and upset that it appears like the party that they have a great hope in isn’t doing anything to show a battle front to what many see as a catastrophe not only for Clacton, but for the parliamentary system entirely.”Suker said the local party had requests for new leaflets turned down and access to the canvassing system removed. “Now I have no candidate to put in front of the people for them to see us at least trying to ‘Save Clacton’,” he added. “This could be very damaging to the party’s image.”Labour has been urging candidates to campaign more in target seats and diverting activists away from the Liberal Democrats’ priority seats to those where it stands a better chance of winning against the Tories. Clacton activists had been twinned with nearby Colchester.A Labour party spokesperson said: “We are working hard to deliver as many Labour MPs as possible in the general election and our campaigners are bringing our message of change to people across the country.”"
The Independent,Independent readers share their views on ‘statesmanlike’ Starmer and ‘obnoxious’ Sunak after BBC debate,"['‘Statesmanlike’', '‘Obnoxious and irritating’', '‘Mocking Starmer’', '‘Lies’', '‘I fear the worst with a Labour government’', '‘A low bar’', '‘Bully who wants to score points’', '‘Pantomime’', '‘Poorly chaired’', '‘Mansplaining’', '‘Grave mistake’', '‘Cheap shot’', '‘Empty promises’', '‘Much better than last time’', '‘Sunak will soon be history’', '‘Starmer always comes off worse’', '‘An insult to the British people’']",Independent,27 June 2024 at 7:04 am·10-min read,27,June,2024,07:04:00,10,"Independent readers are divided following another televised head-to-head between Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer.We asked for your opinions following the final party leader clash on BBC, revealing mixed reactions from our community. Some viewers noted an improvement in how Sir Keir challenged Mr Sunak compared to the first debate, with one adding: “Starmer seems to be getting more statesmanlike over time.”But others found Sir Keir too polite and unable to land impactful blows. One reader noted: “Starmer is articulate, but just has not got the bruising instincts of real ‘Old’ Labour politicians.”On the other end of the spectrum, many readers criticised Mr Sunak’s approach as too aggressive, with one observing: “Rishi Sunak has continued his obnoxious and irritating debating style.”Once again, there were calls for better debate moderation, with some blaming the chair for not controlling interruptions.Overall, the clash was seen by many as lacking substantive discussion, reducing it to a spectacle of squabbling and point-scoring.Here’s what you had to say:‘Statesmanlike’Starmer seems to be getting more statesmanlike over time. I don’t think this type of debate is his natural habitat but he had Sunak on the ropes a couple of times.Obviously, Sunak wants the tax worry to lodge in voters’ brains as their pencils hover over Labour and I think he did a reasonably effective if slightly irritating job of getting that across.PaulWaulCaul‘Obnoxious and irritating’Rishi Sunak has continued his obnoxious and irritating debating style. You would think that all that time at private school would have taught him how to debate in a more dignified way. He is using this bolshy style to hide his poor track record on policies, leadership and Tory Party scandals (PPE, covid rule-breaking, unfinished inquiries, foreign interference etc etc)I wish the chair would have been more forthright in controlling the debate.Rachel92‘Mocking Starmer’I believe Rishi had won. Not due to good policy making or a clear set of plans, but because of his use of populism and sensationalism that brought him thunderous applause through his strong words. This was especially seen with mocking Starmer about the idea of working with the Taliban.Thecoldwarguy‘Lies’Sunak came across as rude and increasingly desperate. He thinks if you tell a lie often enough, the population will believe it. The problem he has is that he lies every time he moves his lips.Pearson‘I fear the worst with a Labour government’Sunak came out as a contender with real stuff. Sir Keir as usual is living in the past with a lot of waffle as the plan for the future. I fear the worst with a Labour government.Krispad‘A low bar’All Starmer needs to do in these debates is to not mess up or cause hugely negative headlines. That’s a low bar. He nearly tripped. I would say with doubt that Starmer won only because Sunak has no credibility on any one main topic, whereas Starmer has a little credibility still intact.ItReallyIsNot‘Bully who wants to score points’How did a forensic interviewer like Mishal Hussein fail to stop the constant tetchy and childish interruptions/ talking over Starmer by Sunak?Who will make a better PM? Sunak who shouts over Starmer’s contributions and tells lies: pensioners already pay tax on pensions, or ignores facts such as Tory councils going bust.OR Starmer who may not set the world alight but is measured, thoughtful and actually listens and tries to answer the questions when he is not being shouted over.Who would chair a cabinet meeting where all feel empowered to make contributions? StarmerWho would actually listen to voters rather than interrupt them? StarmerStarmer needed more powerful one-liners to stop himself being interrupted once it was clear that the moderator was not going to do it. He came over as a person who wants to unite the country.Sunak came over as an overexcited small-time playground bully who wants to score points.Lada‘Pantomime’Both lost badly. The pantomime can hardly be classified as a political debate, no real and urgent policies were just remotely mentioned. The UK electorate got the expected pub brawl and nothing else.Both dismal characters knows the UK must raise many billions just to stop the decline after +40 years of Thatcherite pawn, sale and plunder policies, topped with +14 years of needless Tory austerity and corruption. But none of them dare, and the UK electorate largely live in a fantasy world of convenient denial, bickering over platitudes and obvious ineptitude.Sir Keir and his new crew of former Tory sponsors will not go for vital reforms of the UK “democracy” and cannot/will not face reality. And the Sunak gang agree.old dane‘Poorly chaired’Poorly chaired debate by Mishal Hussain. Too much squabbling due to poorly chosen questions from the audience that Sunak answered unchecked by Hussain on the answers while Starmer fumbled. Dreadful. The real loser in this debate is the BBC.Kernow‘Mansplaining’Neither. A pair of men mansplaining and talking over each other-as if one-upmanship was the most important thing to get right. No mention of the Climate Crisis just, ‘He’s going to raise taxes’ ‘No! HE’S going raise taxes!’ on repeat. And both happy to demise and scapegoat vulnerable refugees for their own, political, point-scoring purposes. Depressing.To paraphrase the comments by one chap in the audience; ‘is this the best we’ve got? Carline Lucas for PM!, I say.LizzieM‘Grave mistake’The English electorate made a grave mistake in 2010, and doubled down on this in 2015. It’s not rocket science, but why would anyone trust the Tories with the NHS, unless of course, you didn’t care.Austerity - what were people thinking. Cameron and Osborne remain unrepentant, but come on, the English electorate bought this rubbish! And then, once again, the English electorate buy the multiple Brexit lies, which leads to Johnson, Truss, Sunak and Co. Oh my God, were these representative of the best of what England could offer?!Sunak debates as if Starmer is PM, I suppose it is worth a punt, for the English electorate have repeatedly bought this crap for 14 years. Starmer, like Brown, is a decent man, let’s hope he can begin (and I say begin) to reverse the damage brought about by 14 years of Tory misrule.Ultimately, it is those who voted Tory that bear responsibility. You believed the lies regarding austerity, taxes, Brexit, the NHS, education, etc. The list is endless.mpsurf‘Cheap shot’I felt that it was an extremely cheap shot to choose the awful question which accused both leaders of simply being mediocre. I thought this debased and trivialised the debate. It was pointless as there was no answer to make - no answer anyone could sensibly make.This lowering of debate to insult encourages a cynical, non-voting attitude amongst the viewing audience - which incidentally will only benefit one party.Finally I’m not sure voters can really simply blame their politicians for the state of the body politic, we must also take some responsibility. Perhaps politicians don’t always tell us the truth, because they know full well we never reward them for doing it.Elizabethz‘Empty promises’Felt like Sunak has at least some policies in place for illegal immigration and funding tax cuts rather than making empty promises like Labour. At the moment it looks like Labour is riding on anti-Tories sentiment rather than credibility of themselves and hence I understand the word ‘Surrender’ being used.I am more inclined towards Mr Sunak. Having shown what he can do in the last 18 months.Oracle‘Much better than last time’I think Starmer did much better in this debate than last time. I feel like Sunak’s adolescent, aggressive debate style gets under his skin (tbh I think it gets under everyone’s skin!) - and made him visibly angry at times. And I think he did better when he was fired up.This isn’t Starmer’s natural habitat but I feel he came across as serious and thoughtful - if still trying to stay on message a bit too much; while Sunak came across as smug and petulant. I’m a Labour supporter of course! But I was much happier after this debate than the first one…In all of these “debates”, Sunak has been allowed to constantly interrupt and shout over Starmer, and also peddle lies without being challenged. Not sure how that can be called winning.Kvasir‘Sunak will soon be history’Starmer appeared understandably nonplussed by the tetchy, obnoxious, lying Sunak. This wasn’t a debate but a sixth form diatribe from an overheated little squib that only had two or three insults rehearsed from some scribbled notes he no doubt thought were top dollar scathing insights but were just the last desperate clueless attempts to clawback something, anything, from the impending utter crushing defeat that was looming ever larger.Sunak will soon be history but, sadly, he will go on to be even more wealthy, secure in his self-belief, blaming everyone else for the disaster he left behind.JiminyCricket‘Starmer always comes off worse’Sunak has always been a terrier, baring his teeth and snapping ferociously to make up for a loss of superior arguments. If you go back to the debates held before the December 2019 GE when Johnson sent him out to face the cameras on behalf of the Tories, you’ll see that this is one of his strengths, honed by being schooled in this quick-fire exchange manner so popular in Britain’s public schools.Sunak will always deploy weapons which he believes will leave a mark, and the chief of these last night was scaremongering. It is more than a little ironic that arch-Brexiteer Sunak, who back in 2016 mercilessly attacked the Remain side for what was called Project Fear, used exactly the same tactics when confronting Starmer. These were reinforced through the highly emotive word “surrender”.However, Sunak did make a number of legitimate points amidst all the shouting. It is naive and disingenuous for Starmer to claim that he’ll be able to renegotiate the Brexit deal without offering something substantial in return. He’s ruled out freedom of movement, so he has virtually nothing he can offer the other side.In debating, Starmer always comes off worse for the simple reason that he cannot think on his feet. That’s not something that a barrister or a DPP is routinely required to do. Attempting to stay above the fray and appear prime ministerial in waiting has paid off for him with regard to the polls, but it doesn’t bode at all well for a role in government. Sunak was bad enough but I despair at the thought of Starmer in Downing Street: strategically shortsighted, deluded in his insistence that Labour will somehow be able to deliver growth, and without the force of character and rhetorical skills to persuade the British public of the need to endure yet more hardship.aavo80‘An insult to the British people’These so-called debates are a waste of time. With one week to go, if you have not already decided, then this debate will not alter that fact. From now until the election, the poles are not going to move that much.But the whole format of the debate was unbelievable and a total embarrassment. You have Sunak repeat proven lies like they are facts, shout over the chair and opposition, he looked like he was reading from notes provided.I found the whole debate to be unprofessional and an insult to the British people who wanted a clear discussion on the merits of both parties and policies, and not a p****** match.Both candidates and the BBC did not come over at all well.WhatsupSome of the comments have been edited for this article.

Yahoo News UK,"Will Nigel Farage's Reform UK 'beat' the Tories in the election?With some polling figures putting the Tories and Reform UK nearly neck and neck, could Farage's party really end up with nearly as many MPs as Sunak's?","['What do the latest polls say?', 'Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?', 'Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?', 'What is proportional representation?']",James Cheng-Morris and  Ellen Manning,Updated 14 June 2024 at 4:33 am·7-min read,14,June,2024,04:33:00,7,"Leading pollster John Curtice has poured cold water on suggestions that Reform UK is now beating the Conservative Party in the general election polls.As representatives from seven parties took prepared to take part in a TV debate on Thursday, a YouGov survey for The Times newspaper said Reform’s support had increased by two points to 19%, putting them ahead of the Tories for the first time.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage took the the opportunity to hail the poll results in the debate, declaring: “We are now the opposition to Labour.”But Curtice urged caution, insisting that single polls should not be relied on. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""This is one poll - we’ve actually, I think, had four other polls published in the last 24 hours - none of which have had Reform ahead, not even all of which have had Reform gaining ground, but quite a couple of them certainly suggesting it’s also got very close.""He said it may not be the case that Reform are ahead - and could be on average four or five points behind. But he said: ""This is still bad news for the Conservatives. The only way Rishi Sunak can hope to get even to base camp in narrowing the lead that Labour have started off with this campaign was to squeeze the Reform vote.""He added: ""Rather than making progress, things are actually going backwards, not least of course because of Nigel Farage’s decision to fight this campaign.""With many speculating that Reform UK with Farage at the helm could ""beat"" the Tories, Yahoo News UK takes a look.What do the latest polls say?YouGov’s voting intention tracker, updated on Tuesday, suggests the Tories and Reform UK are neck and neck.With Labour well ahead on 38%, the Tories are trailing on 18% – compared to a high of 53% under Boris Johnson in 2020 – with Reform UK just behind on 17% and the Liberal Democrats on 15%.However, there are multiple polls taking place at any one time by a number of different companies.According to the PA news agency, an average of all polls that were carried out wholly or partly during the seven days to June 13 puts Labour on 43%, 21 points ahead of the Conservatives on 22%, followed by Reform on 14%, the Lib Dems on 10% and the Greens on 6%.And while Reform’s average is up one percentage point on the figure for the previous week and the Tories are down one point, there is still an eight-point gap, on average, between the two.Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?Unless something remarkable happens, in short: 'No' - and that's because of the first past the post (FPTP) voting system in which the candidate with the largest number of votes in their constituency is elected.According to the Electoral Reform Society, which is against FPTP, this system leads to a situation where “even if millions of voters support the same party, if they are thinly spread out across the UK they may only get the largest number of votes in a couple of these contests – so only win a few MPs"".“Tens of thousands of voters supporting a different party, but who live near each other, could end up with more MPs. This means the number of MPs a party has in parliament rarely matches their popularity with the public.”Rishi Sunak on the campaign trail on Wednesday. (AFP via Getty Images)Farage knows this well. As the leader of UKIP in the 2015 election, he saw his party win 12.6% of the nationwide vote and one seat. The Liberal Democrats won 7.9% of the vote... and eight seats.Indeed, YouGov last week released a poll – put together using the multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) surveying technique, from a sample size of nearly 60,000 respondents – which suggested the Tories would win just 140 seats, having won 365 in 2019. But this is still 140 more than the zero it projected Reform UK to win, in spite of its strong polling figures.The model had Reform UK ""performing strongly in a number of seats but still a long way off winning in any"", with projected second-placed finishes in 27 constituencies.YouGov's MRP projection. (YouGov)Granted, this model was formed between 24 May and 1 June, before Farage's headline-grabbing intervention on Monday last week in which he announced he would be standing as an MP.But, even as Reform UK polls closer than ever to the Tories, it's difficult to imagine the party winning more than a handful of seats.Chris Hopkins, director at polling firm Savanta, told Yahoo News UK that in one respect, Reform UK is at an advantage compared to Ukip in 2015 because ""Ukip took votes from both Labour and the Conservatives, and we are not seeing that with Reform UK – they are all coming from the Conservatives.""That is the consequence of Rishi Sunak making immigration a centrepiece of the campaign and failing to deliver on it. Even if you have voters that are neutral on immigration, they would say the small boats policy has been a disaster.""But even so, Hopkins said, Reform UK is still ""at a huge electoral disadvantage"" in that its votes are not very concentrated, they are very evenly spread.""There are going to be some races where Reform UK is strong - the Nigel Farage factor in Clacton is really interesting - but realistically its ceiling is five seats: and that’s a high ceiling.""Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey on a campaign visit in Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire, on Wednesday. (PA)Like Reform UK, Sir Ed Davey’s Liberal Democrats are performing well in the polls.In a sign of how defensive the Tory campaign is becoming, one online party advert claims voting for Reform UK or the Lib Dems could give Labour 100 extra seats, resulting in the biggest majority in its history.It depicts a scenario where the Conservatives are beaten into third place behind the Lib Dems, with just 57 seats, despite getting 19% of the vote and without Reform winning a single seat.Read more: Pollsters got it wrong in 2015, so could Labour’s lead be overestimated? (The Guardian)However, it remains unlikely the Lib Dems will finish second. YouGov’s MRP poll projected the party performing strongly, winning 48 seats. This would be up 37 from 2019, but still nowhere near the Tories’ projected 140.However, amid all this talk about projections, it’s worth remembering they are still only polls and not a definite indicator of how people will vote on 4 July. The 1992 and 2015 elections are notable examples of how polling didn’t match the end results of Tory wins.What is proportional representation?Proportional representation, as defined by the UK parliament, is an electoral system ""in which the distribution of seats corresponds closely with the proportion of the total votes cast for each party. For example, if a party gained 40% of the total votes, a perfectly proportional system would allow them to gain 40% of the seats.""This differs from the first past the post system, as set out above, in that a relatively high vote share rarely corresponds with increased seats for the smaller parties. In 2019, for example, the Lib Dems won 11.5% of the vote but only 1.7% – 11 – of the 650 seats.Unsurprisingly, both Reform UK and the Lib Dems support proportional representation.The Lib Dems this week made it part of their manifesto, with the party saying it would introduce the single transferrable vote method, a form of proportional representation which allows electors to rank their preference of candidates on the ballot.The party previously sought to change the UK’s voting system while in the coalition government under then-leader Nick Clegg, but voters rejected the plan in a 2011 referendum.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?
