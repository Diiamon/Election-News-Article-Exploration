And it would have been a fitting way to celebrate the centenary of the infamous Zinoviev Letter.In 1924 the Labour Party had formed its first government. It was a minority administration, dependent on the Liberals, and was under siege from its formation. While party leader and Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald was moderate, pragmatic, and certainly anti-communist, he and his party were constantly accused of being overly sympathetic to Moscow.Their decision to normalise Britain\\u2019s relationship with the Soviets, only seven years after the Russian Revolution, however, fuelled paranoia about \\u201cBolshevik influence\\u201d, and this fear even extended to some within the security services. It was partly the notion that Labour was too close to the Soviets that led to the MacDonald government losing a confidence vote and having to go to the people.Four days before the election, the Daily Mail published a letter ostensibly from Grigori Zinoviev, head of the Communist International in Moscow, the dreaded Comintern. It ordered the Communist Party of Great Britain to commit acts of sedition and argued that, \\u201cA settlement of relations between the two countries will assist in the revolutionising of the international and British proletariat not less than a successful rising in any of the working districts of England, as the establishment of close contact between the British and Russian proletariat, the exchange of delegations and workers, etc., will make it possible for us to extend and develop the propaganda of ideas of Leninism in England and the Colonies.\\u201dIt sounds like a parody today but at the time was taken seriously, even by some who claimed to be experts. The Soviets were in fact anxious to build closer ties with Britain, but less due to ideology than to Russia\\u2019s poverty and desperate need for loans and financial support. As a result, Zinoviev himself quickly and officially denied that the letter was genuine. But as anti-Communists said at the time, well he would say that wouldn\\u2019t he.Although Labour leaders were understandably furious, their eventual vote wasn\\u2019t especially damaged by the letter, with supporters either not believing its authenticity or not caring even if was true. The party also ran more candidates than before, so the overall tally was higher.The Conservatives were always strong favourites to win but certainly attracted voters who were genuinely frightened of what would happen if a Labour government formed closer ties with Moscow. The major victim of the letter was probably the Liberal Party, already in a rapid decline. These \\u201cred scare\\u201d tactics pushed many of their usual voters into the hands of the Conservatives.But it also led to a lasting Labour Party suspicion of British as well as Soviet Communism, and a determination to emphasize the non-Marxist nature of British social democracy, something that was only interrupted when Jeremy Corbyn became leader. Partly as a result of the letter, the new Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin distanced his government from Moscow, and the Soviet Union became increasingly isolated.That would have delighted the writers of the letter, who were almost certainly white Russians, monarchists, or other emigres who wanted to discredit the Labour Party and prevent Britain from aiding the Soviets in any way. The Zinoviev Letter was a hoax, and that so many people believed and continued to believe its authenticity says more about popular paranoia and credulity than about the letter\\u2019s verisimilitude.Within a few years, Stalin controlled the Soviet Union, incarcerated and killed millions, and oversaw a forced starvation of Ukraine. Courageous people wrote genuine letters about what was going on inside the country, but they were usually given far less acceptance than the Zinoviev forgery.As for Ramsay MacDonald, he would go on to be Labour Prime Minister once again between 1929 and 1931 and then lead a National Government until 1935.In 1934 Grigory Zinoviev was arrested, put on trial, and accused of crimes against the Soviet Union. The following year, after torture and humiliation, he was ordered to plead guilty to various outlandish and absurd charges. He said he would do so if his life was spared. \\u201cThat\\u201d, said Stalin, \\u201cgoes without saying.\\u201dHe was then executed.\",\n          \"The youngest of three boys, Sir Ed Davey had a childhood marked by adversity. His mother died when he was a teenager and his father died when he was just four.As an adult, Davey now cares for his son, who is disabled with a neurological condition.So what do we know about the man who leads the third party in British politics?His early lifeEd Davey was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on Christmas Day in 1965. He was the youngest of three boys, but lost his father at just four years old and then his mother when he was in his mid-teens. She had spent three years battling cancer, during which time he nursed his mother together with his grandmother and brother Henry.Once a keen Scout and Air Scout, he later remembers feeling \\u201cisolated\\u201d at school because of his caring responsibilities, which meant he couldn\\u2019t take part in after-school activities or sports. \\u201cThe last 18 months she was bedridden and in a lot of pain. I\\u2019d spend hours on the bed, talking to her,\\u201d he said. Davey was with his mother when she died at Nottingham General Hospital, after being placed on an unsuited dementia ward.After both his parents had died, Davey was brought up by his maternal grandparents in the village of Eakring, though his grandfather died soon after. He spent much of his childhood and young adulthood close to his grandmother. \\u201cFirst of all, she was looking after me. Then we were looking after each other,\\u201d he said.His familyDavey married Emily Gasson, a former Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate who unsuccessfully stood in four elections and is now a councillor, in 2005 and the pair have two children, a son and daughter.Their son, John, born in 2007 and now a teenager, is disabled with a neurological condition. He has attended special schools but is now educated at home with a tutor \\u2013 a change that Davey said led to him becoming verbal for the first time. He has spoken about his anxiety about who will care for his son when he and his wife are no longer around. \\u201cIt\\u2019s the thing that worries me more than anything else in my life,\\u201d Davey said.Gasson was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in 2012. She was well for many years following her diagnosis, but declined during lockdown and is working on recovering her physical strength.His parentsEd Davey, pictured with his family. (Liberal Democrats)His father, John, was a solicitor and his mother, Nina, a teacher. Davey has described how he was inspired to study by his mother, who always wanted him to try hard academically and who he wanted to impress.His educationDavey attended the private Nottingham High School, the alma mater of former chancellor Kenneth Clarke. He became head boy, with Labour MP Ed Balls \\u2013 who was studying in the year below \\u2013 watching on.After school, he achieved a first class degree in philosophy, politics and economics at Jesus College, Oxford where he was junior common room president. After becoming an economics researcher for the Liberal Democrats he returned to study, reading for a master\\u2019s degree in economics at Birkbeck College, London.Ed Davey as Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change alongside the then leader of the Lib Dems, Nick Clegg, and Jo Swinson, pictured during the coalition government in 2015. (Getty)Why is he a Sir?For three years, the Lib Dem leader was a member of the cabinet in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition government, holding the post of secretary of state for energy and climate change from 2012 to 2015. He was knighted in the 2016 New Year\\u2019s Honours for \\u201cpolitical and public services\\u201d.\",\n          \"Whatever the results of the general election, voters heading to polling stations today are guaranteed to see a fresh look in the House of Commons as many MPs are set to stand down.Following Rishi Sunak's snap poll announcement, 75 Conservative MPs announced they would not be seeking re-election - a post-war record, surpassing the previous record of 72 who quit before the 1997 election.A former prime minister, Theresa May, and ex-chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, were among the 'big beasts' to confirm they were standing down, along with levelling up secretary Michael Gove.Veteran MP Sir John Redwood and former business minister Greg Clark are also quitting, as is Brexiteer Dame Andrea Leadsom, a key ally of Boris Johnson, who said she was leaving Parliament after \\u201ccareful reflection\\u201d.In Sir Keir Starmer\\u2019s party, 30 MPs announced they were leaving the Labour benches, including former deputy leader Harriet Harman, shadow defence minister Steve McCabe and veteran MP Dame Margaret Hodge.In total, 132 MPs announced they were standing down at the 2024 general election.
