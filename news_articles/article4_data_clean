The Independent,Grant Shapps admits Tories ‘unlikely’ to win election as Sunak urged to ‘go for jugular’ on Starmer,[],Archie Mitchell,17 June 2024 at 11:33 am·5-min read,17,June,2024,11:33:00,5,"Grant Shapps has admitted the Conservatives are unlikely to win the general election, saying he is a realist and pleading with voters to help prevent a massive Labour majority instead.The defence secretary said he would not “pretend black is white” by claiming Rishi Sunak is on course to remain prime minister, adding it is “not the most likely outcome”.And while he said a Tory win is still possible, he said he lives “in the real world” and warned of “the dangers of Labour” if Sir Keir Starmer enters Downing Street with what he called a supermajority.Grant Shapps said he ‘lives in the real world’ (PA Wire)Mr Sunak meanwhile is being urged to “go for the jugular” and launch more direct personal attacks against Sir Keir to turn round the Tories’ faltering campaign.The prime minister has been warned he has not focused enough on the Labour leader and he needs to go after Sir Keir’s record. With the Conservatives still more than 20 points behind Labour in the polls, cabinet ministers have called for a change in direction and questioned whether the PM is comfortable enough launching personal attacks against his opponents.They are now focused on damage limitation, with Tory sources hoping the party can hold onto 140 or more seats – which would still see Sir Keir become PM with a significant majority.Click here for our live coverage of the general election campaign.Asked on Times Radio if a Tory victory was unlikely, Mr Shapps said: “I think that’s the realistic position, isn’t it? I mean, I live in the real world. So you know, let’s not try and pretend black is white.”But he insisted: “We’re still fighting for absolutely every single vote, which is absolutely the right thing to do, and warning of the dangers of Labour.”Penny Mordaunt said the election is not a foregone conclusion (AFP/Getty)His intervention came after Penny Mordaunt, seen as a leadership contender if Mr Sunak stepped down after the election, painted the Conservative Party as the underdog in the election campaign. In an interview with The Independent, Ms Mordaunt said: “There are lots of pundits, and some politicians, saying it’s all a foregone conclusion. Of course it’s not. It’s going to come down to what people do with their votes – and I’m fighting for my city, and I’m going to carry on fighting until the polls shut.”Mr Sunak on Monday insisted the Conservatives are “on the right track”, despite Mr Shapps’s comments.Speaking from Centrica’s Rough 47-3B gas rig, the PM said: “There’s still two and a half weeks to go in this election, I’m fighting hard for every vote because I believe we can win.“And there’s a very clear choice at this election: it’s having your taxes cut by the Conservatives or facing significant tax rises with the Labour Party.”But, speaking to The Times, cabinet figures called for Mr Sunak to go after Sir Keir’s work as a human rights lawyer, his support for ex-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his calls for a second Brexit referendum.One said: “Rishi is a really nice and deeply honourable guy. I’m not sure whether he’s uncomfortable instinctively with the personalised attacks but it has been more generalised so far.“He will sign a deal with the French, he will undo Brexit, he will rip apart our institutions. The guy’s a socialist, and there’s a real chance people will give him a free rein if they back Reform.”Another said: “He needs to make it personal. I think he was very badly affected by D-Day but he needs to go after Starmer now ... I don’t think there are any other options left.”Mr Sunak returned to the campaign trail on Monday (PA Wire)The minister was referring to Mr Sunak’s disastrous decision to leave early during commemorations for the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings.Another senior Tory told The Times: “Rishi needs to go for the jugular. His natural instincts are not to go for the jugular. That can be useful. But it’s not useful when you’re in a fight to the death. The question is whether the Tories will end up with closer to 100 seats or closer to 200.”An ally of the PM pointed to his attacks on Sir Keir during the first head-to-head debate on ITV in which Mr Sunak referenced the Labour leader’s past work as a defence lawyer on behalf of radical cleric Abu Qatada.Another perceived weakness among Tories is Sir Keir’s past support for Mr Corbyn, which saw him come unstuck during a grilling by Sky News presenter Beth Rigby.Under repeated questioning, Sir Keir said he only campaigned for a Labour win in 2019 because he wanted good Labour MPs to keep their seats and was “certain we would lose”.Labour Party leader Keir Starmer’s previous support for Jeremy Corbyn is seen as a weakness by some Tories (PA Wire)Labour has promised not to rejoin the EU single market if it wins the election.Asked about calls for Mr Sunak to “go for the jugular”, Mr Shapps told Sky News: “It is right that we highlight the risks of an unchecked Labour majority … because people need to know what they would be getting which is a heck of a lot more tax to pay in every direction.”He stressed that the Conservatives are the underdogs at the election but claimed “I still think we can do it”. Mr Shapps added: “I really think it’s important to warn people that voting any other way apart from Conservative guarantees a Labour-Starmer government.“Now, if that’s what you want, then fine. But, actually, if you don’t relish the idea of Starmer coming in, raising your taxes, having no plan for illegal migration … voting any other way than Conservative would be dangerous because it would allow Starmer a blank cheque to do those things and many other things besides.”"

Similar feelings play a part in whether you are open to new experiences, such as trying strange dishes in a restaurant or bungee jumping.Voting is often irrational, and factors such as charismatic leaders can often sway which box people tick on their ballot, says Dr Rebekah Wanic, a mindset psychologist, university lecturer and self-optimisation coach.Read more: 'Why I’m voting tactically in the general election'Dr Wanic, founder of Vent to Reinvent, says that the reasons people vote certain ways are complex. People can and do change the way they vote, she says, but the reasons this happens are not always what you might expect.'Bad' stories tend to stick more than good policiesIn this election, prime minister Rishi Sunak has been the subject of negative stories around his attendance at the D-Day service and his ‘deprivation’ in not having a Sky dish as a child.Negative stories tend to ‘stick’ more in people’s minds even than more relevant information such as new policies, Dr Wanic explains.She said: ""Humans are predisposed to pay attention to negative information and give it more diagnostic weight because of a negativity bias. These types of stories typically have a strong emotional component, which makes them stick out more in memory as well so they have more long-term impact.""Users on social media platforms reinforce these tendencies by sharing more negative stories as well.""People who feel disgust strongly tend to be conservativeStudies have shown that people who feel disgust strongly may have more right-wing political views - with volunteers confronted with images of cockroaches, vomit and snakes.Other studies have suggested that right-wingers tend to be more disturbed by threatening facial expressions.Dr Rebekah Wanic, a mindset psychologist, university lecturer and self-optimisation coach (Vent to Reinvent)But while studies have shown a link, it’s best to take these with a tiny pinch of salt, says Dr Wanic.She said: ""Most work here is from lab-based assessments, which is not to say it’s inaccurate but making strong claims about the role of disgust should be tempered because the active role of disgust online during vote casting has not been definitively outlined.""Left-wingers tend to be more open to experienceSome psychological research suggests that left-wingers tend to be more open to new experiences than right-wingers. So if you’re the sort of person who is constantly learning new musical instruments, or exploring the back of beyond, it’s more likely you’ll be left wing.By contrast people with high conscientiousness (ie who are good at regulating their impulses) and are careful and diligent tend to gravitate to right-wing parties. Dr Wanic said that the evidence around these studies is ‘mixed’, but, ‘Conservatives tend to be more risk averse while liberals tend to be more tolerant of ambiguity.’Voters don’t always vote in their own interestThere’s a lot of psychological research which suggests that voters often don’t vote in their own interest, Dr Wanic said. Instead, charismatic candidates and factors such as the ‘likeability’ of politicians can sway people to vote in ways that aren’t actually good for them.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

Follow The Telegraph’s general election live coverageWhat are the voter ID requirements?Everyone wanting to vote in the UK must produce photo ID to take part in certain elections.For voters in England, Scotland and Wales, this includes UK parliamentary elections, by-elections and recall petitions. Those in England also need their ID for local elections.The requirement does not apply to Holyrood, Senedd or council elections in Scotland and Wales. People in Northern Ireland already needed photo ID to vote, so the rule change does not affect them.Voters in both England and Wales also need ID for police and crime commissioner elections.The rule has been applied in stages, beginning with the local elections in England on May 4, 2023. This year’s general election will be the first time ID is required for a national poll.The change marks a significant departure from the previous system in most of the UK, where voters only had to verbally confirm their name and address.What types of ID are accepted?Voters are required to show one form of photo ID at the polls, and it does not need to be in date so long as it is recognisable as the person at the ballot box.However, it must be the original version – not a photocopy – and the name on the ID should be the same as it appears on the electoral register.Acceptable forms of voter ID include:Passport issued by the UK, any of the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, a British Overseas Territory, an EEA state or a Commonwealth country (including an Irish Passport Card)Full or provisional driving licence issued by the UK, any of the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, or an EEA stateA Blue BadgeAny identity card bearing the Pass (Proof of Age Standards Scheme) hologramAny of the following travel passes:Older person’s bus pass funded by the GovernmentDisabled person’s bus pass funded by the GovernmentOyster 60+ card funded by the GovernmentFreedom passScottish national entitlement card issued for the purpose of concessionary travel (including a 60+, disabled or under 22s bus pass)60 and over Welsh concessionary travel cardDisabled person’s Welsh concessionary travel cardSenior SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandRegistered blind SmartPass or blind person’s SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandWar disablement SmartPass issued in Northern Ireland60+ SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandHalf fare SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandAny of these government-issued documents:Biometric immigration documentMinistry of Defence Form 90 (Defence Identity Card)National identity card issued by an EEA stateElectoral identity card issued in Northern IrelandVoter authority certificateAnonymous elector’s documentDo the rules apply to postal votes?No. You do not need to have any form of photo ID to vote by post.However, you will be asked to provide your National Insurance (NI) number when you apply to verify your identity. If you are not able to do this, you will need to explain why.The deadline to apply for a postal vote is 5pm on Wednesday June 19 in England, Scotland and Wales, with Saturday June 15 the limit in Northern Ireland. You must also be registered to vote.How can I get a voter ID card?You can apply for a free voter authority certificate (VAC) either online or by post. To complete an online application, you will need a recent, digital photo of yourself and your NI number.You can still apply if you don’t have an NI number but you will need to provide alternative documents as proof of identity, such as your birth certificate, a bank statement or utility bill.To apply by post, you will need to fill out and send a form to your local electoral registration office.You will need the address of where you are registered to vote, a recent photo of yourself and your NI number.Again, other supporting documents are accepted but using these may prolong the application process.The electoral registration office must receive your form by 5pm, six working days before the election you wish to vote in.There is a different form to complete if you want to apply by post and you are living abroad, a member of the Armed Forces, a civil servant or a British Council employee.What if I do not have a valid ID?Anyone without a form of ID that fits the requirements can apply for a VAC.This is not a substitute to registering for vote, which must be done in advance of any application.Why was voter ID introduced?The aim was to stamp out voter fraud by forcing people to prove their identity at the polls.In his Government-commissioned report, Lord Pickles warned that the authorities were in a “state of denial” and “turning a blind eye” to the problem of electoral fraud.Why is voter ID so controversial?The Government has said the change is necessary to curb the “inexcusable potential” for “stealing someone’s vote” by simply quoting their name and address at the ballot box.However, critics say actual claims of electoral fraud are very rare in the UK.In 2019, the last general election year, there were only 33 allegations of impersonation at the polling station out of more than 58 million votes cast, according to the Electoral Reform Society.Opponents of the rule have also warned it will make it more difficult for certain people to vote, including the disabled, transgender and non-binary people, and black and ethnic minority groups."
The Independent,"Tories are the underdog in the election, Mordaunt says, as she calls for party to ignore polls and rally",[],David Maddox,16 June 2024 at 2:57 pm·7-min read,16,June,2024,02:57:00,7,"Penny Mordaunt has issued a rallying call to beleaguered Tories across the UK that the election result is “not a foregone conclusion” – but conceded that her party is now very much “the underdog”.With many seeing Ms Mordaunt as a leader in waiting after a Tory defeat, she admits she felt “let down” by Rishi Sunak over the D-Day fiasco, which hit the headlines just hours before she was due to take part in a televised debate.But she also made it clear that she wants to see tax cuts, in a message to her party as well as the country.The Tory cabinet minister gave a wide-ranging interview to The Independent from her bellwether constituency of Portsmouth North. Ms Mordaunt won the seat from Labour on her second attempt in 2010, and has increased her majority in each election since. In the interview, she addressed:The inside story of how she reacted when she learnt that the prime minister had left the D-Day commemorations earlyWhy she believes the Tories need to be pushing tax cutsWhy the polls could be wrongHow she deals with misogyny in politicsHow she prepared for the TV debatesPenny Mordaunt is seen by many as a leader in waiting (ITV)Apart from Mr Sunak, Ms Mordaunt has been the only cabinet minister the Tories have trusted to stand front and centre in the election campaign with her two appearances in the seven-way party debates.When news broke on 6 June that Mr Sunak had left the D-Day events in Normandy early, Ms Mordaunt was campaigning in Portsmouth, the home of the Royal Navy, where the liberation of Europe was planned and launched.She had attended the events in Portsmouth the day before, and was getting ready for the first of the two televised debates, which was due to take place the following day. Her first statement on the debate that Friday was extraordinary, declaring that the prime minister had been “wrong”.Ms Mordaunt shares a moment with Angela Rayner after the first televised debate (BBC)“I felt the same as every one of my constituents,” she told The Independent. “And that was that we were let down, and I think the prime minister rightly apologised for that.”Portsmouth prides itself on being Britain’s “most patriotic city” and is full of Royal Navy veterans who have served around the world as well as being home to current serving personnel. Ms Mordaunt, who is in the Royal Navy Reserve herself, described her reception when she met veterans a few days later.“I’ve been out at a veterans’ event since, because we had the 42nd anniversary of the Falklands war [on Friday],” she said. “And so I was out with a lot of them then, and I got a very warm response from them.“I think it is what it is. I’m sure that the prime minister, if he could turn back time, would do something different. It’s done, and he was just right to apologise. There’s nothing else that he could have done, I think, in that circumstance.”The campaign has seen many setbacks for the Conservatives right from the start, when the nation watched the prime minister get drenched as he announced a snap election in a rain-sodden Downing Street.But with less than three weeks to go, Ms Mordaunt still believes her party can turn its fortunes around.“We are the underdog, yes,” she said. “There are lots of pundits, and some politicians, saying it’s all a foregone conclusion. Of course, it’s not. It’s going to come down to what people do with their votes – and I’m fighting for my city, and I’m going to carry on fighting until the polls shut.“We’re getting a really good response from people [on the doorstep in Portsmouth]. We’ve helped a lot of people, and they know who I am, and what I’ve done, and what I stand for.”The D-Day 80th anniversary in Portsmouth, Ms Mordaunt’s constituency (AP)She added: “A poll is a poll. It’s just statistics, but it’s not reflected from our experience on the doors here.”Ms Mordaunt laughed at the idea that she is a “celebrity politician”, but admits that fame has its advantages.“People know me,” she explained. “I don’t have to introduce myself, but it’s been great. And it’s just been really pleasant, actually chatting to people, and I think we’ve been offering the right things.”She is also clear that taxes are the way for the Tories to turn things around, even though a Techne UK poll for The Independent revealed that trust in her party over the issue has collapsed.In an apparent message to her party leadership, she also pushed for tax cuts after reports that cabinet ministers had pushed for more in the manifesto.“There are some blue skies ahead, and now’s the point where we need to go further on those tax cuts,” she said. “As the campaign has gone on, people have been raising concerns back to me. There’s distrust there, because of Labour’s previous record of being in government and what they’ve done elsewhere.“[Labour’s] taxes – that’s always bitten this city hard. With fuel duty, [there are] traders here, freight is important here, and people remember Labour’s fuel duty escalator – and we’ve frozen fuel duty for 14 years because we understand that is critical, not just to motorists and freight, but to people’s supermarket bills as well.”Ms Mordaunt says Rishi Sunak ‘rightly’ apologised for leaving the D-Day commemoration early (Sky News)She insists that her city’s experience of a Labour government before 2010 is why she believes that her party needs to keep fighting to the end.“I feel really strongly about stopping a Labour government. Last time they were in power, it meant, here in Portsmouth, we had the worst MRSA infections in a hospital in the country; [we had the] worst maths results. We had raw sewage running off Portsdown Hill. We had terrible flooding.“Cosham town centre was underwater in the winter. We had 600 kids playing truant for more than six months out of the school year. It was terrible, and taxes were high. We had tax-credit maladministration. It was awful.”She is less willing to address the future beyond 4 July though, including her own potential leadership ambitions or the possibility of Nigel Farage joining the Tories.“It really isn’t about us, you know, as individual politicians. It’s about the country, and it’s about my community.”While Ms Mordaunt is not pencilled in for any more TV debates, she said she is willing to go into battle again if there is a “Deploy! Deploy! Deploy!” command from CCHQ (Conservative Campaign Headquarters).She insists there was little preparation ahead of her appearances, which saw her dominate both debates with ferocious attacks on Labour’s deputy leader Angela Rayner.“I’m not particularly precious,” she said. “I know what I want to say and just go for it.”And Ms Mordaunt has sought to quash speculation that her hair – which became a social media phenomenon during the first debate – was a deliberate tactic.“I’m afraid no thought went into it whatsoever,” she explains. “On both occasions, someone else did my hair. I had other things to concentrate on.”After her second debate, The Independent revealed some of the misogynistic comments made on a Tory members’ Facebook group about her. But Ms Mordaunt shrugs such comments off.“I tend not to worry about these kinds of things,” she said. “But look, I’m a 51-year-old woman, I’ve had a fair deal in my lifetime, but it shouldn’t stop you doing anything. I don’t give it a second thought.”"
The Independent,Constituency challenge: Sunak vs Starmer in the tourism stakes,[],Simon Calder,18 June 2024 at 3:10 am·6-min read,18,June,2024,03:10:00,6,"By the time I pedalled wearily into the broad High Street of Northallerton, I was rather wishing I had made the trip across Rishi Sunak’s vast constituency by helicopter.The prosperous county town of North Yorkshire is partnered with Richmond in the prime minister’s home patch. The parliamentary boundaries of Richmond and Northallerton stretch fully two-thirds of the way across the north of England.It is a canvasser’s nightmare. The western end is 20 miles from the Irish Sea at Morecambe Bay, while the eastern edge is just five miles from Yorkshire’s North Sea coast. So thinly populated is it that I encountered many sheep before meeting anyone with an actual vote.Keir Starmer’s constituency, in contrast, is a narrow and densely populated rectangle of north-central London. Holborn and St Pancras runs from Tufnell Park in the north (not a park but a Tube station) to Covent Garden in the south. I reckon you could pedal the whole thing in 20 minutes without breaking either the law or a sweat.I took my time to evaluate the tourism potential of each. Would the leader of the opposition’s vibrant community prevail over the hundreds of square miles of sunlit uplands in the prime minister’s constituency?The scores are now in, with 100 points divided between the candidates over 10 rounds.Getting there: For my visit to Rishi Sunak-land, I arrived from Kirkby Stephen, a station on the Settle & Carlisle Line in Cumbria. There is one main-line rail station in Richmond and Northallerton: the latter town is astride the East Coast line. Trains run from Northallerton to London King’s Cross in about three-and-a-half hours.All three north-facing termini in the capital are in Keir Starmer’s constituency: King’s Cross, St Pancras and Euston. The eastern edge borders an entrance to Farringdon station on the Elizabeth Line.Starmer 8, Sunak 2Nearest airport: Closest to Holborn and St Pancras is London City (seven miles). Closest to Richmond and Northallerton is Teesside (200 yards). Helicopter parking available. To be fair, though, London is the world centre of aviation; Teesside is not (yet).Sunak 8, Starmer 2Getting around: Keir Starmer’s voters can choose from a dozen Tube stations. Between the Piccadilly line stations of Holborn and St Pancras, the Piccadilly Line runs every couple of minutes.Which way now? Starmer’s constituency has more stations than Sunak’s (Simon Calder)Between Richmond and Northallerton – the two towns in Sunak’s constituency – bus 55 runs three times a day (except Sundays and public holidays) and takes 38 minutes.But the London Tube costs more (minimum £2.70) than the elusive North Yorkshire bus (£2, or free for the pensioners who comprised the entire population of the one I saw).Sunak 5, Starmer 5Accommodation: St Pancras may have the magnificent Renaissance hotel, built into the fabric of the world’s greatest railway station. But for value, the Catterick Garrison Premier Inn wins every time. On election night the rate is £84 for a double.Same room type, same chain, different constituency: a painful £198 at the King’s Cross. That is 135 per cent more. “If you think Labour will win, start saving now,” advises the prime minister.Sunak 8, Starmer 2Eating and drinking: Central London has rather more culinary choice than rural North Yorkshire, but for the purposes of fair comparison the only common thread is Wetherspoons.At the Barrel Vault inside St Pancras station, a pint of Carlsberg and a burger costs £11.58. At the Buck Inn in Northallerton’s High Street, the same tasty combo comes in at just £6.03.Sunak 8, Starmer 2Cheap and cheerful: the Buck Inn, the Wetherspoons pub in Northallerton (Simon Calder)Culture: Keir Starmer is MP for the British Museum, which has the largest permanent collection in the world. It features the Elgin Marbles (Room 18) and the Rosetta Stone (Room 4). Admission is free.Rishi Sunak is MP for the Richmondshire Museum, which has some shovels on display in the Tyson Gallery. Admission £7.Starmer 9, Sunak 1Nature: Richmond and Northallerton is surely the most scenic inland constituency in England. In the west, the Yorkshire Dales begin high on the moors, with sparkling water carving deep valleys that become populated by pretty villages as you descend. The patchwork landscape is embroidered by dry-stone walls, and even the large military presence (and Premier Inn) at Catterick is softened by woodland.Farmer Starmer? Not in London NW1. Holborn, St Pancras and “nature” do not easily combine in the same sentence. The closest you can get to the great outdoors is the Camley Street Natural Park beside the canal, run by the Wildlife Trust.Sunak 9, Starmer 1Red peril? Kentish Town Road, in the middle of Keir Starmer’s constituency (Simon Calder)Shopping: Camden Market (daily except Christmas Day) vs Northallerton Outdoor Market (Wednesdays and Saturdays).Starmer 8, Sunak 2Spirituality: Each constituency has an exquisite medieval church. St Wilfrid’s in Langton-on-Swale in North Yorkshire has outlasted the parish: not a house can be seen from the churchyard. The rector, Jenni Lane, says: “Only the calling of the birds can be heard and sometimes the bleating of sheep or an occasional distant car or tractor. It is one of the most peaceful places imaginable.”Follow the lane to the end and you reach the banks of the Swale as it throws a lazy loop on its gentle journey to the sea.From the churchyard of the 12th-century St Pancras Old Church in London, all you can hear is the drone of trains from the tracks 50 yards away, and the traffic along Pancras Road on the other side. What wins it for Starmer: the Soane Mausoleum in the grounds, whose shape inspired the red telephone box.Starmer 6, Sunak 4Telephone template: Soane Mausoleum in Old St Pancras Church yard (Charlotte Hindle)Biggest public lie: Starmer’s constituency – but as a result of Sunak’s action. The middle of Holborn and St Pancras has been ripped out by work on the High Speed 2 rail project, which was originally based at London Euston.“New trains… new Euston… new adventures,” promises a hoarding close to Mornington Crescent. Residents might be annoyed by the disruption but with “up to 11 high-speed trains every hour” from a shiny new station, surely they will be mollified?Except that the Conservatives have cancelled the entire HS2 project north of Birmingham, and for good measure suspended work on London Euston. If and when it finally opens, the new station will be much scaled down.Sunak 5, Starmer 5Final score: Sunak 52, Starmer 48 – which, as we know, constitutes an irreversible decision."
Herald Scotland,Swinney: Scottish Labour should stand up to Starmer over two-child benefit cap,[],Jody Harrison,18 June 2024 at 2:14 am·3-min read,18,June,2024,02:14:00,3,"Scotland’s First Minister has challenged Scottish Labour to stand up to Sir Keir Starmer in demanding an end to the two-child benefit cap.John Swinney has said the 2017 policy, which restricts child tax and universal credits to the first two children in the majority of households, was politically “indefensible”.It also comes with an associated rape clause which allows women who conceived a subsequent child through coercion or abuse to apply for an exemption.Pressure has been mounting on Sir Keir to scrap the cap after the party’s manifesto included a desire to reduce child poverty but failed to mention the specific policy.Anas Sarwar has said his Scottish Labour party backed scrapping the limit but now faces additional calls to convince his UK party to take the same approach.READ MORE: Anas Sarwar promises pay hike for 40,000 young Scots as he eyes up 2026 electionIt comes as Mr Sarwar sets out his party’s manifesto on Tuesday amid warnings from the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) that the number of children impacted by the cap will rise to about 670,000 in the next five years, while 250,000 will be affected next year.Appealing to Mr Sarwar, SNP leader Mr Swinney said: “If Labour’s manifesto is to be believed, they have the financial headroom to scrap this policy – that they are refusing to do so is clearly an attempt to talk tough on social security as they seek right-wing votes south of the border.“Politics is about choices – and Labour is choosing to prioritise austerity over lifting thousands of children out of poverty. It is a completely indefensible political decision.“Anas Sarwar also has a choice – he can choose doing the right thing for vulnerable children in Scotland, or doing what he is told by Keir Starmer. That is a decision that will speak volumes – and the people of Scotland will be watching.”READ MORE: Forbes blasts Labour and Tories on immigration for 'actively harming' economyHe added: “That Labour under Keir Starmer intend to continue with this Tory policy makes clear just how far removed they are from Scotland’s values.“I am calling on Anas Sarwar and Labour in Scotland to join with me in demanding that Keir Starmer immediately change course and abandon this hated Tory policy.”Scottish Labour social justice spokesperson Paul O’Kane said: “Tackling child poverty has been part of Labour’s mission from day one – as our record in government makes clear.“But right across Scotland, children have been let down by the toxic combination of two bad governments.“The Tory government in Westminster has shown how little it cares about Scotland’s kids, but the SNP is also trying to deflect blame.“John Swinney, Humza Yousaf and Nicola Sturgeon have all broken promises, having presided over virtually static rates for children in poverty.“A UK Labour government with Scottish MPs at its heart will tackle poverty at its root by making work pay, cutting bills, growing our economy, supporting affordable housing and reviewing Universal Credit.“Scotland’s young people deserve a better future.”"

It had looked likely that Rishi Sunak would wait until the autumn to call the next election, but the Prime Minister announced in a rain-sodden speech outside of Downing Street on May 22 that July 4 was the chosen date.Follow The Telegraph’s live general election coverageMany assumed Mr Sunak would want more time for the new Rwanda deterrent and recent tax cuts to take effect, having described a ballot in the second half of the year as his “working assumption”.But speculation reached fever pitch in Westminster when the Conservatives refused to rule out an election being called that day. That afternoon, an umbrella-less Mr Sunak announced his snap election decision and set in motion the vote to happen six weeks later on July 4.The choice means that Mr Sunak will have been in No 10 for 618 days by the polling date and has been called a “mistake” by figures like Prof Sir John Curtice, the polling expert.Why is there an election now?Tory figures close to general election planning had also been working under the assumption there was not going to be a summer ballot, but that all changed on May 22.Lord Cameron cut a trip to Albania short in order to return to a Cabinet meeting and Grant Shapps delayed a flight to a Nato meeting two hours to be there.On the day of the announcement, news came that the rate of inflation had fallen even further than expected, which Mr Sunak hailed as a sign that “everything is heading in the right direction”.With the Government’s record perhaps at its strongest on the economy, the Prime Minister was keen to use the news as a launchpad for triggering the election – but what else played into his decision?Key factors for the Prime Minister would have included whether economic statistics was continuing to improve, and whether polling and focus group research suggested that voters were feeling the positive effects of the National Insurance cuts, crediting the Tories for the boost.Getting Rwanda deportation flights off the ground also strengthened the case for going to the polls in the summer, along with a steady decline in the NHS elective waiting list.It had been rumoured that figures in Downing Street were mulling over whether it would be in the Tories’ interests to trigger a ballot sooner rather than later, despite being way behind Labour in the polls.Why was the general election not on the same day as the local elections?The general election could have been called on May 2 - the same day as the locals - but Rishi Sunak made the decision to avoid a spring poll.The Institute for Government pointed out that a spring election would avoid the risk that “a heavy defeat in the local elections could increase pressure on the Prime Minister – including from within his party – and make it difficult to regain momentum ahead of an election that would by then be less than a year away”.However, that opportunity passed. On March 14, the Prime Minister ruled out a national ballot on May 2, confirming there “won’t be a general election on that day”.It was thought that heavy losses at the locals could tempt restless Tory MPs to mount a challenge against their leader.However, despite a dire set of results for the Conservatives, resulting in hundreds of council seats lost, the rebels appear to have backed off for now.What happens next? Following Mr Sunak’s announcement on May 22, Parliament was prorogued and dissolved eight days later on May 30 after the Prime Minister was granted permission by the King Charles.Prorogation happened on May 24, in line with the 2022 Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act that sets out polling day to take place 25 working days following the dissolution on May 30, landing the general election on July 4.Election candidates have begun to use the six-week lead up to ballot day to campaign for their parties, including both Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer who have undertaken appearances up and down the country.Both leaders, and many more political figures, have also taken part in TV election debates in a bid to win over voters and released their 2024 party manifestos, starting with the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives. It is up to each party when to publish its manifesto, but an analysis by the Institute for Government shows that all Labour and Conservative manifestos since 1997 have been launched between 18 and 29 days before the election.Voter registration is usually open until the 12th working day before polling day, which indicates that it will close towards the end of June.How are general elections called?It is up to the Prime Minister to decide when to hold a national vote, but this power has only been restored in recent years.In 2011, the Fixed Term Parliaments Act effectively put the House of Commons in charge, with general elections held every five years unless a majority of MPs willed it otherwise.For an election to be called early, two thirds of the House had to back the plans. This is how Theresa May’s snap election was triggered in 2017. Alternatively, MPs could spark a ballot by passing a vote of no confidence in the Government.After trying and failing three times to secure the necessary two thirds majority for an early vote in 2019, the Tories opted to circumvent the law with a new purpose-built piece of legislation - the Early Parliamentary General Election Act - which required only a simple majority to pass. This paved the way for Boris Johnson’s snap election in 2019.The Government went on to repeal the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, replacing it with the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act. This new law stripped the Commons of its power to block an early ballot, putting the Prime Minister back in control.Traditionally, the Prime Minister travels to Buckingham Palace to request the dissolution of Parliament, before returning to Downing Street to announce the forthcoming election.How often are elections called? Each Parliament must be dissolved for a general election by the fifth anniversary of the day it first met.This measure was passed under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act by the 2011 coalition government, which set in stone the five-year periods between general elections.Elections may be held earlier – such occurred in 2017 with Theresa May and 2019 by Boris Johnson following a Brexit deadlock – under special circumstances.However, local elections such as the May 2024 by-elections and mayoral elections operate on a different time scale. Who can vote in the general election?The vast majority of UK adults can vote in a general election.In order to vote, you must:be registered to votebe 18 or over on the day of the election (‘polling day’)be a British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizenbe a resident at an address in the UK or Gibraltar, or living abroad and registered as an overseas voter (it is also possible to register if you have no fixed address)not be legally excluded from voting (for example, if you are serving a prison sentence)When should I register to vote?The deadline for registering to vote is usually midnight at the end of the 12th working day before polling day, meaning voter registration is open until June 18 at 11.59pm.When will polling take place?Parliament was dissolved a few days after the election announcement and polling day takes place 25 working days after that.The Civil Service has entered “purdah” – the period between an election being called and polling day which involves strict restrictions on the work of officials to ensure that Whitehall resources are not being used to benefit any party in particular."

PA Media: UK News,Sunak: Tories can win General Election but people’s frustration ‘undeniable’,[],PA Political Staff,17 June 2024 at 2:23 pm·5-min read,17,June,2024,02:23:00,5,"Rishi Sunak has insisted the Tories can still win the General Election after Cabinet minister Grant Shapps said a Conservative victory is unlikely.The Prime Minister said he understands people’s frustrations but gave a more optimistic assessment of his party’s chances than the Defence Secretary, who said that to claim the Tories are on course for a win would be to “try and pretend black is white”.As the party continues to languish behind Labour in the polls, he said Sir Keir Starmer lacked “the courage of his convictions” and suggested his rival would find the job in Downing Street “hard to do well”.Asked during a huddle with journalists on the Tory battlebus about what he thought of his political opponent, the Prime Minister said: “What I’d say is Keir Starmer is someone who clearly doesn’t have the courage of his convictions.“He also is not prioritising investment in our country’s security. I think that is deeply concerning as someone who’s sat in this job for 18 months, at a time when the world is more dangerous and uncertain than it’s been since the end of the Cold War, having just come back from the G7 and a peace summit about Ukraine in Switzerland.“It’s obvious that the world is incredibly dangerous and for someone who wants to be prime minister of our country not to prioritise investing more our country’s security I find deeply concerning.”Mr Sunak’s comments came as Nigel Farage launched Reform UK’s “contract” with voters to add to the Conservatives’ woes.Labour has an average 20-point poll lead over the past week – on 41% ahead of the Tories on 21% and Reform on 15%.Speaking during a visit to a Centrica gas rig earlier on Monday, the Prime Minister said: “There’s still two-and-a-half weeks to go in this election, I’m fighting hard for every vote because I believe we can win.“And there’s a very clear choice at this election: it’s having your taxes cut by the Conservatives or facing significant tax rises with the Labour Party.”(PA Graphics)Asked if he understands people’s frustrations with the Tory Party, with some voters deciding to turn to Reform UK, he replied: “Of course I understand people’s frustrations with that – I mean that’s undeniable, and I’ve been very clear that we have made progress, but there is more to go.“But the point now is we are on the right track and this election is about the future.”Mr Shapps earlier told Times Radio it is “possible to win the election”, but conceded it is “not the most likely outcome”, adding: “I’m a realist.”Asked if a Tory victory is unlikely, he replied: “I think that’s the realistic position, isn’t it? I mean, I live in the real world. So, you know, let’s not try and pretend black is white.”Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer and shadow chancellor Rachel Reeve on a visit to Southampton (Stefan Rousseau/PA)Meanwhile, Labour accused Jeremy Hunt of “admitting” pledges in the Conservative manifesto are “completely unfunded” after the BBC reported the Chancellor last week said that promised tax cuts would be funded by savings from a back-to-work programme announced in the autumn statement.In a sign of the campaign intensifying as it enters its fourth week, shadow paymaster general Jonathan Ashworth put a copy of the Tory document into a shredder at a hastily arranged press conference in London, claiming that is what Mr Hunt had done to the Conservatives’ economic credibility.The Tories have set out plans for billions in tax cuts, which they claim would be paid for by £12 billion of savings on welfare.Mr Sunak’s visit to a Centrica platform in the North Sea came as Mr Farage was setting out Reform’s plans – which he suggested were the first step on the path to a potential election win in 2029.Mr Farage added: “Our ambition is to establish a bridgehead in Parliament, and to become a real opposition to a Labour government.”He said the Tories would not be able to provide opposition because “they spend most of their days arguing among themselves, and they’re split down the middle when it comes to policy”.In other developments:– Reform set out a four-point plan for immigration including: leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, allowing zero illegal immigrants to settle in the UK, establishing a new “Department of Immigration” and returning migrants who come over in boats to France.– Labour claimed Chancellor Jeremy Hunt had driven a “coach and horses” through the Tory’s manifesto promises by saying that a £12 billion squeeze on welfare which the Conservatives plan to use to fund tax cuts had already been announced and factored in to the existing government finances.– Scotland’s First Minister John Swinney said the SNP will include a social tariff on energy, broadband and mobile bills in its manifesto this week.Labour intends to spend the week focusing on its plans for the economy, with shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves joining Sir Keir on the campaign trail.Sir Keir used a visit to a port in Southampton to say that a renegotiated Brexit deal could remove “an inhibitor” to economic growth.Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves and shadow secretary of state for business and trade Jonathan Reynolds met business leaders on Monday morning at the start of a campaign week focusing on the economy (Lucy North/PA)He said: “We took a decision to leave the EU, so we are not going to go back in. But we think the deal we’ve got is botched, it’s not good enough and I think many businesses would say: ‘We need something that works better for us.'”Ms Reeves used a Financial Times interview to suggest she would seek to revise parts of Boris Johnson’s 2020 Brexit deal by seeking closer alignment with EU rules in the chemicals and veterinary sectors, better touring rights for UK artists, and greater mutual recognition of qualifications for financial services workers.The Labour frontbencher also pledged to “hit the ground running to show that Britain is open for business” by holding a global investment summit in the first 100 days of entering government.She met members of her British infrastructure council on Monday morning to discuss attracting foreign investors who have been put off by political instability in the UK."

He said ministers are “making it up as they go along” and called the plan a “distraction from their failures in defence over 14 years”.Click here for our live coverage of the general election campaign.In a letter seen by The Independent, the long-serving Labour MP said Mr Shapps had thrown the general election pledge into confusion and called for him to come clean.Defence secretary Grant Shapps has sown confusion about the policy (Yui Mok/PA Wire)The Tory manifesto sets out that every 18-year-old in the UK will be given the choice between a year of civic service or military service.It promised a “year-long full-time placement in the armed forces or cyber defence” for 30,000 18-year-olds, while others will be forced to volunteer for one weekend each month with organisations such as the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI).The military service option promises to be “competitive and paid, so our armed forces recruit and train the brightest and the best”, taking up much of the estimated £2.5bn cost of the policy.But last week Mr Shapps plunged the policy into chaos by claiming 18-year-olds will only take placements in the armed forces for 25 days per year, not the year-long placement originally promised.He told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “It’s not, as you presented, 30,000 people over an entire year, it’s 25 days a year for those 30,000.”Speaking on the same programme a week later, Mr Shapps said he was “referring specifically to the accommodation element”. He added that those taking part would not need to be in accommodation for the year, but for 25 days of training.Mr Healey said the claim raised several questions, most importantly what the service personnel would do for the remaining 340 days of the year when they do not have accommodation.Shadow defence secretary John Healey has demanded Grant Shapps answers questions over the scheme (Yui Mok/PA Wire)He also demanded to know the difference between the 25-day training course for 18-year-olds and the 14-week basic training course required of all other new recruits.“After that 25-day training course, what happens to them for the rest of their twelve months in service?” he said.He added: “The confusion you have created has raised serious questions as to what level of involvement there has been in the design and costing of this proposed scheme among ministers and officials at the Ministry of Defence.”Mr Healey lashed out at the £2.5bn costing of the scheme, saying the confusion reinforced doubts about whether the figure was a realistic estimate.“This is the flagship policy of the Conservative manifesto - the very first announcement that Rishi Sunak made during the election campaign - so we would expect the government to be absolutely clear how much it will cost, and how it will work, rather than both those questions being thrown up in the air by your comments over the last week,” the senior Labour figure said.“The Tories National Service pledge is an undeliverable plan and a distraction from their failures in defence over the last 14 years. With confusion over where people will be accommodated and how long they’ll serve, the Tories seem to be making it up as they go along,” he added.It is only the latest criticism of the policy, which has been panned by the former head of the Royal Navy, Admiral Lord West, and other senior military figures.Lord West, who was First Sea Lord from 2002 to 2006, warned that “anyone with the most basic experience of how much it costs, and what it entails, to turn a new recruit into someone that can usefully serve in our armed forces would not need a royal commission to tell them that the proposal as currently presented is utter nonsense”.“This ill-thought out conscription scheme will increase pressure on defence and waste money,” the former Navy chief wrote, adding: “Rather than enhancing our defence capability, it would further reduce it.”The Conservatives were asked to comment."
