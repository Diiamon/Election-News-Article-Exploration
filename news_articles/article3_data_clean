Glasgow Times,SNP to include social tariff on energy and broadband in General Election manifesto,[],Morgan Carmichael,17 June 2024 at 10:33 am·3-min read,17,June,2024,10:33:00,3,"First Minister John Swinney has said The SNP will include a social tariff on energy, broadband and mobile bills in its manifesto this week.The proposal will see those on low incomes, with disabilities and the elderly pay less on their bills, with the party suggesting they be cut in half.Mr Swinney unveiled the plan today ahead of the SNP manifesto being published on Wednesday.READ NEXT: Scottish Liberal Democrats pledge to boost wages in General Election manifesto(Image: Gordon Terris)The proposal would be funded by a mixture of general taxation and “an obligation” from profits of energy companies, with the party claiming the cost would be about £7.8 billion for the present year.The First Minister said that his party want to update entitlements “for the 21st century”.He said: “This community is wrestling with some of the highest levels of fuel poverty in our country, it is literally unbearable for people, despite the fact that this community is producing vast amounts of renewable energy.""“At the heart of our manifesto will be that commitment, that we will argue for a social tariff funded by general taxation and by the power companies which will reduce the costs for those who are vulnerable in our society and give them a material contribution to reducing the cost of living.“Today, none of us really can operate without connectivity, access to broadband, access to telecoms, so many public services are delivered by that mechanism as well.“So we’re going to propose that the social tariff extends also to broadband and telecoms costs, so that people are liberated of the excessive burden and they’re able to access public services and their wider communication in society, because they have got a tariff that is appropriate for meeting their circumstances.”READ NEXT: Glasgow West: Partick to Drumchapel the battle for votesAndrew Bartlett, the chief executive of Advice Direct Scotland, welcomed the commitment.He said: “It is encouraging to see the need for a social energy tariff moving up the political agenda with just over two weeks until voters go to the polls,” he said.“We believe it is the best way of fixing the UK’s broken energy market.“In the wake of a winter which has once again seen millions of people struggling to afford to heat their homes, it is time for concrete action.”But the Scottish Tory finance spokeswoman, Liz Smith, said: “The SNP have hiked taxes on ordinary Scots to the highest levels anywhere in the United Kingdom and it seems like they just want to keep driving them higher and higher.“Everybody wants to see lower energy bills but the way to do that is not to make hardworking Scots pay more and hammer the North Sea oil and gas industry, which would put jobs at risk.“This proposal for a half-priced tariff is a half-baked idea that might sound good on paper but, in reality, it would just see Scots paying even more in tax and do huge damage to our economy.”It comes after the Scottish Liberal Democrats launched their manifesto today.The party's manifesto included plans to introduce a carer’s minimum wage with a £2 an hour boost, as well as fast-tracking access to mental health counsellors in schools.The party also said that an additional £1b in capital funding would come to Scotland through Barnett consequential which could be used to tackle the housing emergency and local health facilities across the country."
The Guardian,"Do Reform UK’s election claims on tax, immigration and environment add up?","['Economy and taxation', 'Immigration', 'Environment and energy', 'Healthcare', 'Policing and crime', 'Education', 'Housing and transport', 'Other policies']",Peter Walker and Sandra Laville,17 June 2024 at 10:50 am·5-min read,17,June,2024,10:50:00,5,"Reform UK insists its plans are “not just another party manifesto”, because it does not expect to win the election. But there are a lot of policy ideas in its 28-page “contract” with the electorate. Here are the main proposals from Nigel Farage’s party.Economy and taxation• In short: Liz Truss on steroids. There would be cuts to personal tax worth £70bn a year, including scrapping income tax below £20,000, and big cuts to stamp duty and inheritance tax. Cuts to business levies including corporation tax would cost £18bn a year.• Reform says this would be paid for by scrapping plans to reach net zero carbon emissions (more on that below), plus £50bn a year from cutting government departments and quangos, and £35bn from the technical process of making the Bank of England stop paying interest on commercial bank deposits created through quantitative easing.• All this could be filed under “fiscally bold”. The Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank termed the package “problematic”, saying: “Even with the extremely optimistic assumptions about how much economic growth would increase, the sums in this manifesto do not add up.”Immigration• There is only so much room to the right of the Conservatives on this subject, but Reform would use most of it, pledging a freeze on “non-essential” immigration, with only a handful of exceptions, and higher national insurance imposed on overseas workers.• On asylum seekers, Reform would take Britain out of the European convention on human rights (ECHR), process people offshore and “pick up illegal migrants out of boats and take them back to France”.• On small boat crossings, there would be significant doubts about whether, even outside the ECHR, the UK could actually return asylum seekers to France. And a freeze on immigration, even with limited exceptions for the NHS, could have a significant impact on the social care and hospitality sectors.Environment and energy• A major part of Reform’s offer is to roll back green targets, including to scrap net zero goals altogether, which the party says would save £30bn a year over 25 years. The International Energy Agency estimated that the UK spent less than £9bn a year between 2021 and 2023 on low-carbon energy policy. This is less than comparable developed countries, and, according to an LSE study, higher green investment is likely to lower household bills and boost growth more than tax cuts.• The manifesto says net zero has increased bills, damaged industries such as steelmaking, and made the UK less energy secure. However, evidence from the IMF shows energy bills have risen because of the UK’s heavy reliance on imported gas.• In terms of threats to security, the World Economic Forum put extreme weather as the leading global risk to security in 2024.Healthcare• As part of the tax cuts, frontline NHS and social care staff would pay zero basic-rate tax for three years, with the aim of boosting staff numbers. There would also be 20% tax relief on private health insurance.• While Farage has called for a move away from the current NHS funding system towards one that also uses social insurance, this idea is not set out in the document. It is fair to say that the health and care plans as they stand are fairly broad.Policing and crime• As well as promising 40,000 more police officers, the party has pledged mass stop and search, and the end of what it terms “woke policing”.• The sentencing regime would be significantly toughened, with mandatory life sentences for anyone convicted of drug dealing, or a second violent or serious offence. And 10,000 new prisons places would be built.• Given that about 10,000 people a year are convicted for drug dealing alone, such policies would need a lot more prison places. Also, there is limited evidence that non-intelligence-led stop and search is effective in curbing crime – or that police forces would want to use it.Education• This section is low on specifics and seems to be led more by culture war issues, with the first two points calling for a “patriotic curriculum” and an end to “transgender ideology” in schools. There would be another tax cut, this one offering tax relief on private school fees.• On universities, as well as scrapping interest on student loans – this does not seem to appear in the costings section – the party would push for two-year degrees, and cut funding to universities it felt were denying free speech.Housing and transport• On housing, Reform says it wants to “unleash” housebuilding, but the party would also protect landlords, scrapping plans to ban no-fault evictions or other renting changes.• On transport, the party would end the “war on drivers”, unilaterally scrapping any clean air zones, low-traffic neighbourhoods and almost all 20mph zones.• These sorts of policies give a flavour of the type of voter Reform wants to attract: older people who are more likely to be homeowners and drivers.Other policies• Social security: “motivate” people to work, and withdraw all benefits if they turn down two job offers.• Brexit: abandon the Windsor framework, which sought to find a compromise over EU trade and not having a hard Irish border.• Constitution and voting: replace the Lords with an elected second chamber; move towards a proportional voting system.• Culture: scrap the BBC licence fee and the Equality Act; make St George’s and St David’s days public holidays."
The Independent,Who is Jovan Owusu-Nepaul? Labour’s general election candidate standing against Nigel Farage in Clacton,[],Matt Mathers,17 June 2024 at 10:48 am·4-min read,17,June,2024,10:48:00,4,"“If you want politics as pantomime,” Sir Keir Starmer said at his party’s manifesto launch last week, “I hear Clacton is nice this time of year.”The Labour leader’s remarks were a not-so-subtle barb at Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, who has launched his return to politics in the Essex seat.But Jovan Owusu-Nepaul, Labour’s candidate, will be hoping he can convince voters in the seat to call curtains on Mr Farage’s eighth attempt to become an MP.A recent poll by Electoral Calculus suggests Mr Farage is likely to win the constituency relatively comfortably, securing 39 per cent of the vote.Labour candidate Jovan Owusu-Nepaul pictured with Reform leader Nigel Farage (Martin Suker)Labour is meanwhile projected to come second with 28 per cent and the party is telling locals that Mr Owusu-Nepaul is the only one who can keep Mr Farage out - calling on voters to cast their ballots tactically.Mr Owusu-Nepaul went to school in Southampton, attending the Warwash Maritime School at Solent University, which specialises in training for those considering working in the maritime industry.He went on to study politics, philosophy and economics at Goldsmiths University in south-east London, graduating with a 2:1 and a distinction in his dissertation, which was a comparative analysis of the political economy of the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn, against the party under the leadership of Tony Blair.He also studied at the University of Cambridge, achieving a master of studies (MSt) in history before throwing himself into politics.During his studies, he served as chair of the Lewisham Deptford Constituency Labour Party and was the first British African/Indo-Caribbean ever to hold the position, and was also one of the youngest Labour chairs at the time.His selection as Labour’s candidate in Clacton was officially confirmed by the party in May.Polls project Mr Farage will win the seat in Clacton for Reform UK (Reuters)A press release described the prospective MP, an active trade unionist and campaigner, as a “young man with a passion for revitalising the constituency and a desire for change”.Mr Owusu-Nepaul said it had been “the honour of my life” to be selected as Labour’s candidate in Clacton, adding: “I know we can mount a campaign to give us a fighting chance of winning the next election and give residents in places like Clacton, Frinton, Walton-on-the-Naze and the surrounding villages a stronger voice in Westminster.”The Conservative Party has held Clacton since 2017, when Giles Watling secured a majority of 15,828.Douglas Carwell won the seat from the Tories in a 2014 by-election after he defected from the party to stand for UKIP, Mr Farage’s old party.According to the Electoral Calculus projection, the Conservatives are on course to secure 25 per cent of the vote, with the Liberal Democrats on 4.4 per cent, the Greens on 2.4 per cent and other parties on 1.2 per cent.But the Best for Britain campaign group claims its analysis shows Labour can still come through the middle to win the seat if Green and Lib Dem voters back the party.The claim came as part of a wider tactical voting analysis by the group published this morning for 451 seats across the UK, including a plan to unseat prime minister Rishi Sunak, his chancellor Jeremy Hunt and predecessor Liz Truss.Best for Britain’s chief executive Naomi Smith said her group hoped to provide a roadmap for the four in 10 voters looking at voting tactically for centre-left parties and wanting to minimise the number of Tory seats, as well as preventing “nativist, populist parties” like Farage’s Reform UK getting a foothold in parliament.She said previous votes in the area showed there was strong Labour support in Harwich, part of the Clacton seat, which “was suppressed by Brexit”. But Harwich had been held by Labour in 1997 and 2001.She said: “Our analysis shows that if the Greens and Lib Dems vote Labour then Labour can come through the middle and win Clacton.”"
PA Media: UK News,Streeting warns against complacency and giving ‘matches back to the arsonist’,[],"Sophie Wingate and Richard Wheeler, PA Political Staff",16 June 2024 at 7:43 am·4-min read,16,June,2024,07:43:00,4,"Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting has urged voters not to give “matches back to the arsonist to finish the job”, as he suggested a Conservative election victory would be a “nightmare on Downing Street”.The Labour frontbencher warned against “breathtaking complacency” over opinion polls predicting a victory for Sir Keir Starmer’s party at the General Election.Polls have continued to heap pressure on Rishi Sunak and underline why the Tories have shifted strategy to warn would-be Reform UK voters not to risk handing Labour a landslide win.Cabinet minister Mark Harper insisted the Conservatives are “fighting to win this election” as he repeated the Prime Minister’s warning that a vote for Nigel Farage’s Reform UK would give Labour “a very large majority” and a “blank cheque” in office.It came after analysis and modelling by Survation put Labour on course for a 262-seat majority with the Tories reduced to a rump of just 72 MPs and Reform potentially picking up seven seats.Mr Streeting told Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips on Sky News: “I just warn people, against this backdrop of breathtaking complacency in the media about the opinion polls, do not give the matches back to the arsonist to finish the job.”NEW: First MRP Since Farage’s return.Labour on course for 262 seat majority.LAB 456CON 72LD 56SNP 37RFM 7PC 2GRN 142,269 interviews conducted online and on the phoneFwk 31 May – 13 JuneConducted on behalf of @BestForBritain.@VasilSurvation and @JackSurvation…— Survation. (@Survation) June 15, 2024He added: “Do people want to see Liz Truss’s mini-budget on steroids, which is the Conservative manifesto, being delivered if there’s a nightmare on Downing Street on July 5, or do they want to see a stable economy with economic growth, shared prosperity, enable us to invest in our public services without clobbering working people with taxes? That’s the choice at this election.”Mr Harper told the same programme it it not “wise” to regard the election result as a foregone conclusion.But, he continued: “The polls do tell us one thing – they do show people that if people don’t vote Conservative and some of the smaller people vote for the smaller parties and Labour does end up with a very large majority, they’re going to have a blank cheque, they’re trying very hard in this campaign not to spell out how they’re going to pay for any of their promises.”Transport Secretary Mark Harper said the Conservatives are ‘fighting for every vote’ (Victoria Jones/PA)The Transport Secretary went on to repeat the much-disputed Tory claim that a Labour government would increase taxes by £2,000, as the bitter clash over tax and spending plans continues.The Conservatives have produced a list of 17 potential tax increases Labour could make, but Sir Keir’s party said it would refuse to be drawn into the Tory trap of responding to each claim.Mr Streeting declined to rule out council tax rises or re-evaluations.When pressed on this on the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg, he evaded the question and repeated the party’s line: “We don’t want to see the tax burden on working people increase.“None of those pledges in our manifesto requires increases in council tax or increases in fuel duty or any of the other number of taxes the Tories are claiming we want to increase.”Mr Streeting suggested there could be greater spending increases for the NHS than committed to in the Labour manifesto, saying this could happen “only if the conditions allow”.The Conservatives seized on this, with a party spokesman saying: “Labour’s manifesto is just window dressing for the election campaign and they are planning to spend and tax more than they are telling the public.”(PA Graphics)It followed analysis by the Nuffield Trust think tank that suggested both Labour and Tory pledges on the NHS would leave the health service with lower annual funding increases – at 1.1% and 0.9% respectively – than during the austerity era.Scotland’s First Minister John Swinney said: “Scotland has already suffered the consequences of 14 years of Tory cuts, Brexit, and a cost-of-living crisis – the last thing our NHS needs now is even more cuts, Brexit and creeping privatisation imposed by Sir Keir Starmer’s incoming Westminster government.“Independent experts are clear the Labour Party is planning around £18 billion of cuts to public services – and will starve the NHS of the cash it needs to improve health and care services.”"
Yahoo News UK,"Here's how the government spends our taxesAhead of the general election, the Tories and Labour have repeatedly clashed over each other’s tax plans. But how is each pound spent?","['What are the headline tax pledges?', 'What have experts said about these pledges?', 'So how does the government spend our taxes?', 'We are paying more tax than ever']",James Cheng-Morris,Updated 16 June 2024 at 5:21 am·5-min read,16,June,2024,05:21:00,5,"If 2019 was the Brexit election, 2024 is the tax election.The Tories and Labour have repeatedly clashed over each other’s tax plans, with chancellor Jeremy Hunt claiming on Sunday that Sir Keir Starmer would turn the UK into a “taxtopia”.Labour has hit back by accusing the Tories - way behind in the polls - of being “desperate” and having “massive holes” in their own plans.But the Tory focus on tax continued after Starmer ruled out imposing capital gains tax on the sale of family homes. The Conservatives are now demanding he rules out a series of other potential tax measures they claim would be needed to fill a “£38.5bn black hole” in Labour’s plans.But amid all the sniping, how does a government actually spend each pound it takes from us in tax? And what have experts said about the Tory and Labour tax pledges set out in their manifestos this week? Here, Yahoo News UK explains.What are the headline tax pledges?On Tuesday, Rishi Sunak unveiled a manifesto containing a £17.2bn package of tax cuts, including a further 2p cut to national insurance for employees. This will build on similar successive 2p cuts at the autumn statement and spring budget.For the self-employed, the main rate of national insurance would be abolished by the end of the next parliament.The manifesto also promises no increases to income tax, national insurance or VAT. And the Tories have pledged to scrap capital gains tax for landlords who sell properties to their tenants.Rishi Sunak launches the Conservative election manifesto at the Silverstone race track on Tuesday. (Getty Images)Meanwhile, economic stability was Labour’s pitch to voters in its manifesto released on Thursday, with a pledge to cap corporation tax at its current rate of 25% to give businesses long-term certainty.Along with this, Labour has ruled out raising the rates of income tax, national insurance and VAT. It has also committed to charging VAT on private school fees, abolishing the non-dom tax status and closing “loopholes” in the windfall tax on oil and gas companies.In total, Labour plans to raise more than £7bn in revenue from tax, its costings document said.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer launches the party's election manifesto in Manchester on Thursday. (Getty Images)What have experts said about these pledges?Leading think tank director Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said he was sceptical about the Tory manifesto’s costings.“The Conservatives have promised some £17bn per year of tax cuts and a big hike in defence spending,” he said. “That is supposedly funded by reducing the projected welfare bill by £12bn; cracking down on tax avoidance and evasion; and saving billions from cutting civil service numbers, reducing spending on management consultants and ‘quango efficiencies’.“Those are definite giveaways paid for by uncertain, unspecific and apparently victimless savings. Forgive a degree of scepticism.”On the Labour manifesto, Johnson said the tax outlook was equally uncertain: “Yes, [economic] growth could surprise on the upside - and if it does, then the fiscal arithmetic would be easier. But if it doesn’t - and it hasn’t tended to in recent years - then either we will get those cuts, or the fiscal targets will be fudged, or taxes will rise.”So how does the government spend our taxes?First of all, it should be pointed out that the following breakdowns are based on government figures last updated in January: prior to the most recent budget in March. However, they still give a good indication of where taxpayers' money goes.This first chart shows how much is spent comparatively on different sectors.So, almost half of our taxes - 40% - is spent on health (20%) and welfare (20%) alone. When we consider some of the numbers and factors behind these key sectors, we can gain an understanding of why so much is spent on them.For example, under health spending, the NHS has a gigantic workforce of around 1.7 million people: making it one of the biggest employers in the world - and the biggest in Europe. Around two-thirds of its budget goes on headcount.Funding of the NHS is broadly split into two areas: day-to-day running costs, which accounts for the vast majority of spending, and infrastructure. The health service sees around 1.3 million patients every day.And it's not going to get any smaller - acccording to the NHS Long Term Workforce Plan, the projected demand for staff by 2036/37 will be in the region of 2.4 million people.Welfare, meanwhile, is defined by the government as ""social protection"". This includes spending on numerous areas such as unemployment benefits, tax credits, public sector pensions... as well as benefits or support covering categories such as old age, sickness and disability, housing, children and families.Universal credit is expected to account for 27% of total welfare spending in 2023-24.A further 40% of our taxes is spent on national debt interest (12%), state pensions (10%), education (10%) and business and industry (8%).This second chart, meanwhile, shows the total amounts spent on the same areas as above.We are paying more tax than everAccording to an IFS report this week, tax revenue as a share of national income was 36% and rising earlier this month, “the highest tax burden since 1948”.""The parliament that started in 2019 saw the biggest rise in the tax take of any parliament in modern history,"" it said.Taxes as a share of GDP. (OBR)The Office for Budget Responsibility, meanwhile, has previously forecasted (see chart, above) tax will represent 37.1% of GDP by 2028–29. This would be just below the all-time high of 37.2% in 1948.However, the IFS also pointed out the tax burden ""is not high compared with most western European countries"".In 2021, the most recent year for internationally comparable data, UK tax revenue was 33.5% of GDP, compared to an average 39.9% of GDP among the EU14 countries - those in the EU before 2004 - including France and Germany.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

It’s very important to start a tournament with a win and that was our main aim. We definitely didn’t want to lose the game, but we knew had the quality of players to win the game and we proved that.It was a very difficult game and we had to earn it, but those are the ones which feel even better. Tournament football is really hard and of course we feel we could’ve played better, but we won and in tournament football that’s the only thing that matters to be honest.We’ll keep up the momentum. It’s the first game so we won’t get ahead of ourselves. We know we earnt today, but at the same time we know we need to improve in the tournament. So there’s things to learn and things we can also look at and be happy with.On being deployed in midfield:It’s physically demanding but when you’re playing with the likes of Declan [Rice], Jude [Bellingham] and the others in and around you with an experienced back four behind you, it helps.With Declan and Jude talking to you and guiding you through it, it’s hard to go wrong. The manager and the staff, Steve Holland especially, we’ve put a lot of work into this role.So I was well prepared and I knew what was asked of me and what role I needed to do and hopefully they felt like I executed it because we got the win in the end.TAA started in midfield last night alongside Declan Rice - Getty Images03:00 PM BSTTeam guide: FranceWho is the star player? If his rating was not high enough before, then scoring a hat-trick in the World Cup final proved Kylian Mbappe’s credentials as a bonafide superstar. If France win the tournament, Mbappe will be the reason for it.How do they play? Similarly to England, France swap between a 4-2-3-1 and a 4-3-3 formation with Mbappe deployed on the left wing and Antoine Griezmann in the number 10. With Paul Pogba banned and N’Golo Kante ageing, their midfield now relies on Aurelien Tchouameni and Eduardo Camavinga.Chances of victoryFrance go into the tournament among the favourites. However, England await in the semi-finals should both win their group and many are backing Southgate’s team to gain revenge on their Qatar World Cup defeat. Semi-finals.02:51 PM BSTTeam guide: AustriaWho is the star player? David Alaba’s ACL injury means Austria will be without their star player and captain so the focus will fall on Marcel Sabitzer, who now plays his trade for Dortmund after a brief spell at Manchester United.How do they play? Austria have always attempted to play quick one and two-touch football, but under Ralf Rangnick, it is stressed more so than before. Like at Manchester United, Austria are fluid with their formations under the 65-year-old. They fielded a 4-3-3, 4-1-4-1 and a 4-4-2 line-up in qualifying.Chances of victoryWith their leader and star player ruled out and the toughness of the group, Austria’s chances of making it out the group are slim, even in third place, unless Rangnick can master a miracle. Group stages.02:46 PM BSTTeam guide: SlovakiaWho is the star player? Milan Skriniar. The 29-year-old has long been Slovakia’s best player since Marek Hamsik retired. The PSG centre-back can do a good job of marshalling their defence but will fall short in attack.How do they play? Francesco Calzona sets his side up in a 4-3-3 formation with full-backs going forward to make up for the lack of wingers in his squad. Skriniar runs a tight ship in defence after conceding just eight goals in qualifying.Chances of victoryTheir defensive capabilities should see them make a run for second place in the group, however, their lack of firepower going forward could see them come up short. Instead they will progress via the best third-placed teams route. Round of 16.02:37 PM BSTTeam guide: BelgiumFor the two games to come later today, let us take a closer look at the four teams we will see, starting with Belgium:Who is the star player? At 32, Kevin De Bruyne’s appearances at a major tournament are numbered. With his minutes managed at Manchester City after a long injury the summer may come just in time for him to be fit and firing once more.How do they play? Like many top teams with a good midfield, Belgium prize themselves on a possession-based approach usually in a 4-3-3 formation. Jeremy Doku provides the pace which Romelu Lukaku lacks with Amadou Onana holding firm in midfield.Chances of victoryBeing on what looks like to be the open side of the draw, Belgium could coast their way to the quarter-finals if they find form. Getting past that will be a tough ask, but the Golden Generation have one last dance. Quarter-finals.02:31 PM BSTGoal in MunichWOW! WOW! You need to see this goal from Romania.

Always goes missing. Should be permantly dropped in favour of the brilliant Palmer, who has played on the left.”Steve Turner: “Typical Southgate. Tap the ball around, quick goal then sit back and hope for the best. In the second half they were strolling. Where was the aggression, where was the closing down? They won’t stand a chance against the better sides like that. Attack is the best form of defence Mr Southgate.”02:16 PM BSTMarc Guehi speaking to the BBC last nightI thought it went well. It’s always very tough in the first game of a tournament. Both teams want three points. It was a tough test but we played well and I’m very proud of the boys tonight.They have a team of 6ft giants who were very physical but they can play as well. It helps when I’ve got so much experience around me and in front of me. It really helps.[Why did you struggle in the second half?] You’re playing against good players and it’s a tough system to play against. You’re always worried about them getting in behind and their physical strength.I don’t like talking about myself, it’s about the team.

Positionally sound, calm. Tonight was an even bigger test because stature-wise he’s not one of the biggest centre-backs and there was going to be a lot of aerial balls in the box.He dealt with that really well, so, yeah, I thought he transferred what he does with his club on to the biggest stage and he showed what a good player he is.01:50 PM BSTThe thoughts of Kieran TrippierOn getting a win in the first game:It’s always massive. You look across the past few tournaments that we’ve had, it is always crucial to get the first win. We knew it would be a tough game, a tough team to play against and we had to defend our box very well, and I thought we did that.We’ve learned a lot, but the most important thing is the three points. It gives us great momentum, belief. It shows the character of the boys. When it gets tough, you know you have to deal with that.The subs that came on made a huge impact and that’s what we’ve always talked about - the togetherness of the group, everyone has to be ready. You can be called upon at any moment and the subs were a great impact for us.On England’s next game against Denmark:We’re not thinking about a point. We want to go into the Denmark game and we want to win. That’s our only focus. We don’t want to focus on anything else further than that.We know Denmark are a very good side, good quality players, so now the most important thing is we recover as a team and then we focus on Denmark.Kieran Trippier started at left-back against Serbia last night - Richard Sellers/Getty ImagesOn the importance of a clean sheet:Clean sheets are massive. As you look through the winners of tournaments, clean sheets are a massive factor. We talk about that lot, defend our box well and certainly we had to defend crosses because they put some dangerous balls in the box.If you look at the last tournament as well, I think we had the most clean sheets and that can take you far. The most important thing is don’t concede and you see the quality that we have got at the other end to score goals.On Jude Bellingham:You don’t need to be at my age to be a leader. You can be 18, 19, 20. You can lead in different ways.Jude is so young but he leads. Like I said, you don’t need to be an experienced player, you don’t need to be Harry Kane who is the captain, you can lead in any way at any age. We’ve got that in our squad. The new players coming into our squad have done extremely well, they speak up and we have made them feel very welcome.01:36 PM BSTCompetition debut for MainooA special moment for one of our own ✨#MUFC || #EURO2024 pic.twitter.com/5XqgbN00Wo— Manchester United (@ManUtd) June 17, 202401:30 PM BSTScotland defender Grant Hanley speaking to the media this afternoonOn their heavy defeat to Germany:Obviously we’ve had a couple of days. We’ve put [the Germany defeat] to bed. The manager had a couple of meetings last night to go over it and draw a line under it and look forward to the next game.As players we have got to look at ourselves first and look how we approach the game and perform. This is a group [of players] that’s been together for quite a while now. We’ve had our ups and downs together, we’ve shown before we can bounce back from negative results.On responding to critics: I don’t think we need to send a message to critics. Certainly for Scotland supporters, we feel that disappointment as well.I think supporters see it is a genuine side who want to give their all for the country. We have got a massive opportunity to be successful again.On if nerves played a factor in their opening defeat by Germany: These games are huge, a big occasion and everyone wants to play on those types of nights. So obviously there is a bit of added nerves in the atmosphere around the game.But no I don’t think that’s something we can use as an excuse as to why we didn’t perform like we wanted to on Friday. We have got a really close-knit group in camp and those are only the opinions that we have got to take going forward.Scotland will look to bounce back from a heavy defeat to Germany on Friday when they play Switzerland on Wednesday - Andrew Milligan/PA01:20 PM BSTRomania vs UkraineOur live blog has just begun for the 14.00 BST kick-off from Munich and you can follow all the action live here.Munich is the stage for Romania vs Ukraine - Shaun Botterill/Getty Images01:00 PM BSTStatement from Downing StreetThe violent scenes around England’s Euro 2024 opener in Gelsenkirchen “do not reflect the spirit of the tournament”, Downing street said.Seven Serbia fans were arrested after clashes ahead of the defeat against England, with videos showing tables, chairs and bottles thrown before riot police arrived.A Downing Street spokeswoman said: “The vast majority of travelling England fans were in good spirits ahead of the match, but clearly such scenes are unacceptable and do not reflect the spirit of the tournament.”The spokeswoman said Rishi Sunak was “delighted” with the opening 1-0 win.“He is obviously delighted with a win and with a clean sheet for England’s opening game of the Euros.“It was a strong start to the tournament against tough opponents, lit up by [Jude] Bellingham’s performance and his thumping header to get the only goal of the game.”12:58 PM BSTEngland back in trainingThose who were not involved are back training today - John Sibley/ReutersShould Gareth Southgate have brought Eberechi Eze on last night? - Adam Davy/PA12:53 PM BSTFantasy football cheat sheetIf you are a fan of the Premier League’s fantasy football, you are also likely to be very interested in a Euro 2024 version.

Romania or Ukraine? - Chris Ricco/Getty Images12:22 PM BSTYour opinions on England’s win last nightPeter McMahon: “Bellingham was the only one in the side who appeared as if you wanted to move forward. Unfortunately, every time he passed to someone and ran into space, that person passed the ball backwards. In addition, they were unable to play out from the back, even in the most basic manner, and relied on long kicks from Pickford. The only consolation is that they were still exponentially better than Scotland.”Julian Hughes: “England looked really sound. In the last Euro final they looked skilful but a bit innocent and done over by a much more cynical and hard headed Italian team. This time they looked a bit more mature, less volatile, really focused on their own performance and not about to be surprised by fate.”Sean Browner: “We’ve seen this film before and know how it will end. Yes, Foden should have been hooked for Palmer at h/t. I’d also have got Watkins on for Kane to run the channels and stretch Serbia. Kane held the ball up well and took a battering but he hadn’t got the pace to threaten now.”12:16 PM BSTSetting new records20 - Jude Bellingham is the first European player to make an appearance at three major international tournaments before turning 21 (aged 20 years, 353 days today), having played at EURO 2020, the 2022 FIFA World Cup and now EURO 2024.

I think you see in Madrid every week, seen it again (against Serbia), the match winner.I feel like he’s a player that when I’m holding I’ve just got to let him flourish and do his thing, let him feel like he’s got the confidence on the pitch to go out there and do whatever he wants.The more we play together, I feel like the connection and bond we’ve got is really, really good. With Jude, he is just another level isn’t he? That is all I can say really.On Trent Alexander-Arnold:Trent I thought played really well. (It was) his first time properly playing like a defensive midfield role. So it’s a really good trio.On the victory in their opening game:It’s massive. I think we’ve built this team off clean sheets. In the last Euros, I think we had five out of seven and at the World Cup we had a lot of clean sheets. We have real defensive solidity, it’s just about doing it on the night...it was definitely a game of two halves.It was a really important victory, to be honest with you, to kick-start the tournament. I thought we started really well, showed some real great composure with the ball. It’s always tough against a back-five and second half they obviously came on to us a lot more and were probably a bit more of a threat.But in the end, I thought we were comfortable - we’ve just got to use the ball a little bit better in the second half when it starts to get tough.🙌 @_DeclanRice 🙌 pic.twitter.com/s8zlQ0j1Dy— England (@England) June 17, 202411:07 AM BSTThe thoughts of Jude Bellingham after the gameI think the first half shows why we can score goals against any team, and the second half shows why we can keep a clean sheet against any team. I think obviously, commonly with the team, there’s a negative theme around all our games. You know, sometimes rightly so.But I think in this case you take the positives from the fact that, OK, maybe we had to hold on at times and suffer a little bit, but we kept a clean sheet. When you keep clean sheet all you have to do is score one goal to win the game.It’s three points, I think this team is still so new, gelling together with every game. I think inside the changing room we’ll be happy with that. Of course, there will be negatives that we want to kind of rub out but overall I’m pleased with that performance.On Trent Alexander-Arnold:I loved it. I think we had a great balance with the ball, without the ball, particularly in possession I thought Trent was brilliant. He conducts games so well. He’s very calm on the ball. His technique and qualities unmatched, I think, in terms of what he can do with the ball.He’s always positive and that really helps someone like me who wants to get on the ball all over the pitch and try and attack their backline. So, I look forward to having more minutes with him, enjoying how we can develop and how we can get used to each other’s game, and seeing how far we can take the potential.And of course, as always, Declan [Rice] was fantastic. I think he’s one of the best in the world in that position. He’s a joy.11:04 AM BSTGareth Southgate’s post-match thoughtsThat’s the reality of tournaments, they’re a strong team and we had to suffer a bit but that’s good for us.[Jude] writes his own scripts doesn’t he? The timing of his runs. It was a super bit of play in the build-up of his goal. I think all of our forward players looked really good.[Disappointed not to score more goals?] Today was just the finishing and a good save from the keeper from the header. I’m confident we will score goals. It’s not easy to play against a back five but we created chances.I said I’m glad we suffered a bit without the ball [because it will stand England in good stead down the line]. I think is really good for us. I think to defend the box the way we did was really good for us. I was really pleased with a lot of the play. Second half we didn’t keep it as well as I would have liked but to get the win is very important.Jude goes forward a lot and Trent adapted to his positioning really well, used the ball well and had a good effort on goal.10:59 AM BST‘Wolf’ goal celebration explainedCelebrations are always a hot topic of discussion and last night was no different. After Jude Bellingham scored England’s winning goal, he and Alexander-Arnold pulled out an interesting celebration and it has now been explained. Will it catch on? You will probably see all the young kids this week in parks using that celebration.Will this catch on? - Ozan Kose/Getty Images10:50 AM BSTYour reactionJohn Bates: “This result shows exactly the problem with Southgate. In the first half England were good - though why Kane was there who knows and Bellingham had to come and get the ball because they were too slow getting it to him, but the second half was abysmal. If Southgate thinks you can defend a one nil lead for 45 minutes against the likes of Spain, France, Germany or Italy he is delusional. The trouble is the win will flatter him.”Lord Balfour: “Nothing has changed with England, very slow attacking movements, panic in defence and very poor substitutions. Cole Palmer one of the best attacking midfielders and a leading goal scorer, sat on the bench. Southgate has always been clueless and England will be lucky to reach the quarter finals. Just like every other tournament but this time with some of the most talented players.”Bettina Thwaite: “It was a stressful game to watch, especially the second half. Serbia always looked on the verge of scoring. Faced with a better team England will cut a sorry figure. I was trying to discover without success what their game plan was. Their passing especially in the second half was fractured and over excited. They should have calmed down.”Duncan Macdonald: “Sorry but much as I hope they do well I just think Southgate is the most negative thing about the team. It’s all about safety first and protecting the lead once they get it. Sitting on a one goal lead for 70 minutes or 60 if you’re being generous is never going to work against the top teams. He has been found out because of this defensive mindset in two consecutive Championships and unless they are far more positive going forward it looks like he same will happen again. It’s a great shame because England have the makings of a great team but not the manager to capitalise on them.”10:44 AM BSTMbappé not embraced in France?France get their Euro 2024 campaign going this evening against Austria in Düsseldorf.

International football is more “tactical” but games are still there to be won. Despite the ridiculously fawning half-time “analysis” England didn’t create much in the first half. And what a struggle in the second!”Donald Troosers: “You have the pick of the nations players and can put whatever player you want in the position that they are perfect for and have played in all season. So why is Trippier playing on the left when he’s a right footed player? And Foden didn’t seem to know where he was supposed to be! Was Southgate trying to trick the opposition? Didn’t really work....”The West is going west: “They needed someone to come on and set the game alight like Grealish did against Bosnia. Having bored us to death with the Serbia game, maybe Southgate’s cunning plan is to bring such a player on for the next game.”Colin Wolstenholme: “Personally, I think the Foden question has been answered. He is a totally different player for England than he is for Man City, and nowhere near as effective. If anyone can explain the difference I would love to know, but on the last few performances, is he worth a place?”Robert Jeans: “Negative and sloppy. This team could and should have overwhelmed Serbia and won 4 or 5- nil. Sitting back was the risky option. Failure to get players into the box when there are good scoring opportunities, is fairly unforgivable and there was some really poor passing. Had Serbia sneaked an equaliser, it would have surprised nobody.”Stephen Nix: “It was a win and a clean sheet. Yes they were all over them for the first 20 or so minutes and after that a bit careless at times, but they got the job done. Learn from it, tighten up and go on. It’s a results game, we are not drawing pictures.”09:51 AM BSTJude’s complete performanceEngland’s winning goal came from the head of Jude Bellingham, who is coming off the back of a stellar debut season at Real Madrid where he won the La Liga title and the Champions League.

Semis at best.Ian King: “One game in and we’ve already seen a situation where it would have helped to be able to bring on Grealish as a substitute!”Elephant McGee: “A good win, against physically strong opposition. Bellingham is the real deal. Glad that Kane nearly scored as well. There were a few squeaky-bum moments from the opposition. One goal is not enough to be comfortable.”Andrew Marchant: “Man of the match for England was Pickford by a country mile. Not only did he have to deal with constant back passing by England’s defenders and midfield but at one point he was the only England player facing the Serbian goal. Perhaps Southgate needs a compass to work out where the oppositions half is.”Singapore Sling: “We were lucky. Should have put fresh legs on sooner during the second half. Also surprised Gordon wasn’t played.”Steve Murphy: “Bellingham is such a complete midfielder and leader that he almost makes Foden dispensable unless Foden can get out of the spaces that Bellingham runs into and use his intelligence to play off Bellingham then the unthinkable will have to happen and we leave him on the bench, that is how good Bellingham is and Foden needs to realize it quickly.”Jason Hobson: “Dreadful performance against a poor opposition. Southgate seems to have a unique ability to take talented players and make them looks useless by playing them out of position.”You can continue to have your say.09:31 AM BSTAgree with Matt Law’s assessment?FT view: That was tougher than England would have liked, but they got over the line and there was plenty to be pleased about.

The survey of 22,000 people also forecast Reform UK to win seven seats.And on Monday morning, Mr Farage vowed his party would offer a “proper voice of opposition” in an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.At the weekend, Suella Braverman said she would invite Mr Farage back into the party.

general Jonathan Ashworth put a copy of the Tory manifesto into a shredder, claiming that is what Mr Hunt had done to the Conservatives’ economic credibility.He said: “This newsletter, which Mr Hunt released to his constituents in recent days, totally shreds the Tory manifesto and totally shreds any remaining credibility on tax and spend the Tories once had.”A Conservative Party spokesman said: “Unless action is taken, the working-age welfare bill will rise by more than £20 billion a year by the end of the decade.“Labour is in complete denial about this and don’t think it’s possible to save a single penny from this unsustainable rise.“We don’t think that’s right, which is why have set out how we would save £12 billion from the welfare bill by the end of the next parliament, including by controlling spending on health and disability benefits and taking people’s benefits away after 12 months if they don’t accept a job.“Keir Starmer’s refusal to even think about tackling this problem

solution. We need radical, fresh thinking, we haven’t had it for years in this country. We are getting poorer.He added: “Britain is broken, we’re presenting some radical ideas for how we can change that.”Asked why his party has faced repeated controversies with former candidates engaging with right-wing groups on social media, Mr Farage said: “How you define extreme of course is very difficult and we can find many people in the Labour Party and call them extreme left.“Look, we’ve had some problems, the Greens have had even bigger problems than I’ve had.

It’s work from home, pop into Whitehall a couple of days a week.”He added: “If you’re running a company and things are tight, you say to your managers and middle managers, ‘Right, I’m sorry, this is the way it is, you’ve got to cut £5 in £100’ – in fact in tough times it might be £10 in £100 or £20 in £100, and you have to find a way of doing that without affecting the product that we’re selling to the public.”Mr Farage added: “Some of these things we’re proposing are tough but, look, the accumulated national debt is now £2.7 trillion, it was just under £1 trillion when the Tories came to power, we simply cannot go on like this.Farage said the UK is ‘skint’ and in ‘real trouble’ (REUTERS)Suella Braverman’s new ‘cringey’ TikTok election video is actually real14:40 , Holly EvansSuella Braverman’s new TikTok video described as “cringey” has left many viewers confused about whether it is just a parody.The former home secretary was filmed doing a swaggering dance to the soundtrack of Fedde Le Grand and Ida Corr’s 2006 hit ‘Let Me Think About It’.She launched the new account on the social media platform last week with a handful of videos as part of her general election campaign, and it has already received tens of thousands of views.Read the full article here:Suella Braverman’s new ‘cringey’ TikTok election video is actually realTaxPayers' Alliance (TPA) endorses Reform UK’s contract14:35 , David MaddoxMore bad news for Rishi Sunak after centre right think tank the TaxPayers’ Alliance (TPA) endorsed Nigel Farage and Reform UK’s contract with the people.The TPA played a major role in getting the Tories back to power in 2010 by questioning the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown government tax and spend policies and has been staffed by former Tory aides.But as Mr Farage unveiled Reform’s manifesto - or contract - for voters, the TPA put out a statement giving it their support.The TPA said: “Reform’s package of tax cuts, spending controls, and reducing regulation has the potential to offer real relief to Brits struggling under a record high tax burden and give a boost to businesses drowning in red tape.”However, it noted that while the plans for tax are big on promise, the details for reining in spending need to be spelt out for sceptical taxpayers.“Nigel Farage knows how to stand out from the crowd. But for this to be the radical rethink he wants, taxpayers will expect detailed and deliverable proposals on which quangos will be scrapped and which spending programmes will be cut.”Reports Sunak is urged to ‘go for the jugular’ shows Tory desperation, Starmer says14:27 , Holly EvansSir Keir Starmer said that reports Rishi Sunak is being urged “go for the jugular” and launch more direct personal attacks against him for his campaign show that the Tories are “desperate”.The Times reported that Cabinet ministers and senior Tories are urging the Prime Minister to launch “personalised attacks” on Sir Keir over his support for Jeremy Corbyn, his decision to campaign for a second referendum on Brexit and his work as a human rights lawyer.Sir Keir told reporters: “That’s all they’ve got left after 14 desperate years. You get to to the last weeks and their only thing they’ve got left is to attack me personally, I think that tells you everything.”“If they had a record to stand on, they would go into the final two weeks saying these are the brilliant things we’ve done but they haven’t got a record to stand on and if they said they’d done brilliantly people would laugh at them.”He added: “This is desperate.”Sir Keir Starmer told reporters that the Tories were getting ‘desperate’ (REUTERS)Nigel Farage says Reform UK 'not pretending we are going win this election'14:16 , Holly EvansLabour peer Michael Cashman has whip removed after Rosie Duffield comments14:16 , Holly EvansLabour Peer Michael Cashman has had the whip removed after comments he made that Rosie Duffield was “frit or lazy” for calling off local hustings over safety concerns.Sir Keir Starmer told reporters that what Lord Cashman said was “particularly inappropriate and that’s why the support of the whip was withdrawn as it was very swiftly”.Ms Duffield, a Labour General Election candidate who has been a defender of women’s rights and female-only spaces, said her attendance at local hustings was “impossible” because of “constant trolling”.The former EastEnders actor and Labour MEP commented on a social media post about Ms Duffield’s move: “Frit.

It is not what you are going to get from the current Labour and Conservative parties who are virtually indistinguishable, frankly, from each other.”He stressed again that his fight is about “who the opposition is going to be”, as he believes Labour will be in Number 10 in July.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage holding his party’s ‘contract’ with voters (Ben Birchall/PA) (PA Wire)Sunak insists Tories are ‘on the right track’ despite Shapps admitting defeat is likely13:57 , Holly EvansRishi Sunak insisted the Conservatives are “on the right track”, despite his Defence Secretary Grant Shapps admitting earlier today that a Tory victory at the General Election is unlikely.Speaking from Centrica’s Rough 47-3B gas rig, the Prime Minister said: “There’s still two-and-a-half weeks to go in this election, I’m fighting hard for every vote because I believe we can win.“And there’s a very clear choice at this election: it’s having your taxes cut by the Conservatives or facing significant tax rises with the Labour Party.”Asked if he understands people’s frustrations with the Tory party with some deciding to turn to Reform UK, he replied: “Of course I understand people’s frustrations with that, I mean that’s undeniable, and I’ve been very clear that we have made progress but there is more to go.Farage rubbishes Tories plan for national service13:48 , Holly EvansSpeaking in south Wales, Nigel Farage rubbished the Conservatives’ plans for national service, saying: “What we ought to be doing is saying, look, there were 100,000 people in the army in 2010, there are 72,000 people in the army now, let’s not recruit 30,000 part-timers, let’s actually recruit 30,000 people full-time to be in the services – and a similar principle will of course apply across the navy and air force.”He stated his belief that the government had neglected defence “very, very badly” and that the UK should be spending 3 per cent of GDP as quickly as possible.Turning to public services, Mr Farage said a “radical cultural rethink” needs to take place before he highlighted concerns over knife crime.He said: “We’ve no doubt that an approach to policing such as stop-and-search and don’t worry if you’re called prejudiced or you’re doing something wrong, actually you’ll save lives.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage launches his party’s ‘Contract with You’ in Merthyr Tydfil (Ben Birchall/PA) (PA Wire)Net-zero targets and HS2 to be scrapped, Reform UK vows13:35 , Holly EvansReform has vowed to scrap net-zero targets to save £30 billion a year for the next 25 years.The party also promises to fast-track licences of North Sea oil and gas licences.A pledge to scrap HS2 to save £25 billion is also included in the party’s document, along with a ban on Ulez and Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs).Nigel Farage has promised to fast-track licenses of North Sea oil and gas licences (Reuters)Nigel Farage claims government failed to ‘implement’ Brexit during manifesto launch13:30 , Holly EvansFarage acknowledges Reform UK will not form next government13:25 , Holly EvansNigel Farage acknowledged that Reform UK would not form the government after the July 4 General Election – but he said it was the first step on the road to the next contest which could be in 2029.Speaking in Merthyr Tydfil he said: “We are not pretending that we are going to win this General Election, we are a very, very new political party.”He added: “This is not something with which we’re going to govern the country. That’s not possible in this election.“Although this election is for our party, and for me, the first important step on the road to 2029.“Our ambition is to establish a bridgehead in Parliament, and to become a real opposition to a Labour government.”Number of tax cuts promised including abolishing stamp duty13:22 , Holly EvansThe document contains five core pledges - and the first two focus heavily on immigration, while others focus on the economy, education andReform wants to “simplify” the UK’s tax system which it says is more 21,000 pages, while Hong Kong’s is 500 pages.The party is also proposing to lift the minimum profit threshold to £100,000 and reduce the main corporation tax rate from 25% to 15% in three years, which it says would “free” 1.2 million businesses.A raft of tax cuts are also promised, including raising the minimum threshold of income tax to £20,000 a year, abolishing stamp duty, and abolishing inheritance tax for all estates under £2m. (REUTERS)Ban on ‘transgender ideology' included in Reform manifesto13:15 , Holly EvansA ban on “transgender ideology” is included in Reform’s manifesto, with “gender questioning, social transitioning and pronoun swapping” prohibited.The party also proposes a “patriotic curriculum”, which would include pairing the teaching of Britain’s history of slavery or European imperialism, with a non-European occurrence to “ensure balance”.Two-year university courses and mandatory permanent exclusions for violent children are also promised.Reform UK set out four-point plan for immigration13:10 , Holly EvansNigel Farage’s party has set out a four-point plan for immigration including: leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, allowing zero illegal immigrants to settle in the UK, establishing a new “Department of Immigration”, and returning migrants who come over in boats to France.A “freeze” on non-essential immigration “to protect our culture and identity” is also proposed in the first few pages of Reform UK’s manifesto.Under the party’s plans, immigrants who commit crimes would have their UK citizenship withdrawn, with the exception of “some misdemeanour offences”.The party is also proposing to ban international students from bringing dependents to the UK.National insurance would be raised to 20% for “foreign workers” to incentivise businesses to employ British workers.Nigel Farage launches manifesto titled ‘Our Contract With You'13:06 , Holly EvansNigel Farage has launched the Reform election manifesto which he describes as a “serious plan to reshape the way our country is run” as his party pledges to tackle the “population explosion”.Reform has chosen to title its election document “Our Contract With You”, with the leader having previously stated the party believes people associate the term “manifesto” with “lies”.The contract was launched in a run-down community centre in Gurnos in South Wales, as the party sought to drive home “exactly what happens to a country when Labour is in charge”.In the foreword, Mr Farage says: “The Tories have broken Britain. Labour will bankrupt Britain. A vote for either is a vote for more dishonesty and defeat.”He adds: “Once and for all, we will take back control over our borders, our money and our laws.”Nigel Farage has launched his campaign at a community centre in South Wales (Sky News)Tory candidate: 'Enormously frustrating campaign plagued by unforced errors'13:00 , Alex RossTory candidate for South Devon Anthony Mangnall has hit out at the Conservative general election campaign, describing it as enormously frustrating and plagued by unforced errors.The candidate, who was first elected MP for Totnes in 2019, told The Sun’s Never Mind the Ballots: “I mean, it’s an enormously frustrating campaign. I mean, there have been some unforced errors. There have been some forced errors as well for that matter.”He also said he would serve in the Conservative Party alongside Nigel Farage if the Reform UK leader is welcomed into the fold after the election.He added: “You have to consider the fact that a split right is not good. We want to have a united right.“If you take the polling of both reform and the Conservative Party, it’s somewhere in the 30% bracket.

But, to be clear, there is only one outcome of people voting Reform in this election, to give (Labour leader Sir) Keir Starmer a supermajority.”‘We are pro-business’ - Rachel Reeves tells business leaders10:45 , Alex RossShadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has told business leaders that holding a global investment summit in the first 100 days of entering government would show Labour is “pro-business”.Discussing the party’s commitment to holding the summit, Ms Reeves said: “That is an opportunity to show that, with Labour, we are pro-business, we are pro-investment, and we are determined to seize for the UK the investment that we know is out there.”At a meeting on Monday morning of an infrastructure council set up last year by Labour, Ms Reeves said the group of UK-based and international investment firms is something the party wants “to take into government”.Racehl Reeves speaking to business leaders at M&G Investments in central London on Monday (Lucy North/PA Wire)I have a marginal seat - Grant Shapps10:29 , Alex RossDefence Secretary Grant Shapps said he has “always accepted” he has a marginal seat, when asked if he feels vulnerable in his constituency ahead of the election.He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Well, I’ve always accepted, actually, that I have a marginal seat, and I always have done.“I’ve fought this seat and not won it in the past, so I’m in that unusual position of having already experienced that before.”Asked how he thinks the election campaign is going more generally, he said: “There are a lot of people out there who still say that they are undecided.”UK trade deals under Brexit could be amended - Labour10:06 , Alex RossTrade deals set up in the wake of Brexit could be improved, says Labour’s Rachel Reeves, who claims financial services companies says the agreements have not created good opportunity for businesses.Labour has said it will not make any major changes to Brexit.However, in an interview with the Financial Times, the party’s shadow chancellor said Labour could change areas to support businesses, with less need for regulatory divergence.She said: “I don’t think anyone voted leave because they were not happy that chemicals regulations were the same across Europe. When my constituency voted leave it was purely because of immigration.”Sunak top of tactical voting list from Best for Britain campaign09:46 , Alex RossA tactical voting hit list has been produced by campaign group Best for Britain which has placed removing Rishi Sunak from his Richmond seat in Yorkshire as the top priority.Other prominant targets on the list are leadership hopefuls Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman and Penny Mordaunt with home secretary James Cleverly and Priti Patel also under threat.It comes after MRP polling over the weekend suggested the Conservatives could end up with a historic low number seats with a mere 72.Best for Britain is proposing tactical voting in 452 seats recommending 371 for Labour, 69 for the Lib Dems, seven for the SNP, three for the Greens and two for Plaid Cymru.Rishi Sunak tops a tactical voting hit list in plan for Tory wipeoutLaunch more person attacks against Sir Keir Starmer, Sunak told09:35 , Alex RossRishi Sunak is being urged to “go for the jugular” and launch more direct personal attacks against Sir Keir Starmer.The prime minister has been warned his campaign is not focused enough on the Labour leader and he needs to go after Sir Keir’s record.With the Conservatives still more than 20 points behind Labour in the polls, cabinet ministers have urged a change in direction and questioned whether the PM is comfortable enough launching personal attacks against his opponents.Sunak told to ‘go for the jugular’ to save campaign with more attacks on StarmerTory election victory ‘unlikely but possible’ - Grant Shapps09:23 , Alex RossIt’s been a difficult campaign so far for the Tory party, and so in almost every interview of late with a Conservative candidate, the question is asked: “Can the Tories really still win?”This was put to Defence Secretary Grant Shapps this morning by Times Radio, just a day after analysis by Survation found Labour could win a 262-seat majority on 4 July.Mr Shapps said: “Yes, it is possible to win the election. Do I accept it is not the most likely outcome? Yes, I accept that, I am a realist.“But I also think that when people start to narrow down on this focus, in particular I have noticed this with talking to people on the doorstep where they have been perhaps toying voting in another direction and then realising that just gives Starmer more power.”Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said he was ‘a realist’ when asked about the election outcome (PA Wire)All parties are having problems with candidates - Nigel Farage09:00 , Alex RossDuring his interview on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Nigel Farage is asked over the resignation of Reform UK candidate Grant StClair-Armstrong after previously calling on people to vote for the British National Party (BNP).Mr Farage said: “This particular case is a chap in his 70s, who 20 years ago said he was thinking of voting BNP as a protest vote, he was never a member of the BNP.“However, we don’t find that acceptable. Now, we did put in place – with quite a well-known political figure, who runs a professional vetting company – we put in place something, we spent a great deal of money on getting that vetting done, it wasn’t done, and I’ll talk more about that over the next couple of days.“With a short general election every party is having problems with candidates, but effectively when you vote … the choices are not so much the candidates in the constituencies – we’ve almost got a presidential style now. People are voting for or against Keir Starmer, Rishi Sunak, Ed Davey or me. They’re the names that are really on the ballot paper.”Grant StClair-Armstrong has resigned as Reform UK candidate (Reform Party)Nigel Farage says he will 'absolutely' be standing for PM in 202908:50 , Alex RossSpeaking to the Today programme, Mr Farage said: “Our plan is to establish that bridgehead in Parliament and to build that voice to build a big national campaigning movement around the country across the next course of the five years for genuine change.”Asked by presenter Justin Webb if he would be vying to be prime minister at the next general election, potentially in 2029.He said: “Yes, absolutely, I think the disconnect between the Labour and the Conservatives, Westminister-based parties and the country.,The thoughts, hopes and aspirations of the country are so far apart from where our politics is, and the funny thing is, they show no signs of changing.”He said the more Angela Rayner and Penny Mordaunt debated in the seven-way debates last week, “the more they sounded the same”.“Yes, we are aiming to be a big party,” he added.Tory vote collapse so bad Labour argue only they can beat Farage in Clacton08:45 , Matt MathersLabour have claimed the collapse in Tory support is now so bad that only they can stop Nigel Farage winning Clacton if the last remaining Conservatives vote tactically for their candidate.In 2019 Tory MP and former actor Giles Watling won Clacton with 72.3 per cent of the vote and a majority of 24,702, with Labour a very distant third on just 15.5 per cent.Full report:Tory vote collapse so bad Labour argue only they can beat Farage in Clacton‘There needs to be a proper voice of opposition’ - Farage08:43 , Alex RossSpeaking to the BBC ahead of the launch of Reform’s “contract” with voters in South Wales today, Mr Farage is asked by the BBC what it will do to politics he if he is elected and his party do well.“It gives us a voice of opposition,” he says.“The Conservative party have been incapable of agreeing on anything in government, let anyone what the recriminations are going to be after they have suffered a huge defeat.“Even this weekend we have seen Suella Braverman saying ‘oh, Nigel should join the Conservatives’. David Cameron saying ‘he’s ghastly’. They can’t agree on anything they are split down the middle.“We know what we stand for.

But I think in the end, there are only two people who can be in Downing Street, it’s either Rishi Sunak or it’s Keir Starmer.“And if you vote Reform, or Lib Dem, or any other direction for that matter, that simply helps Keir Starmer go in with unchecked power to do things like release all the people who’ve already been rounded up to be deported, which is exactly the opposite to what a lot of Reform voters would want.”When questioned on polls continuing to show a Conservative defeat, Mr Shapps pointed to previous polls which suggested Britain would remain in the European Union and former prime minister Theresa May would increase her majority.He added: “Polls have a history of showing a snapshot in time, which isn’t necessarily the time when the vote happens.” (Getty)Reform candidate made ‘daft comments'08:02 , Matt MathersReform UK said its former candidate Grant St Clair-Armstrong made “daft” comments at a “difficult and angry time in his life”, after he resigned from the party for previously calling on people to vote for the British National Party (BNP).Mr St Clair-Armstrong, who will remain on the ballot paper as an independent in North West Essex, posted on a blog called the Joli Triste in 2010: “I could weep now, every time I pick up a British newspaper and read the latest about the state of the UK.“No doubt, Enoch Powell would be doing the same if he was alive. My solution … vote BNP!”A Reform UK party spokesperson said: “Some 15 years ago, by own admission made some daft, inappropriate comments at a difficult and angry time in his life.“He regrets them, and has resigned.”Shapps: Unlikely we’ll win election but it’s still possible07:50 , Matt MathersGrant Shapps said it is unlikely the Tories will win at the general election, but it remains a possibility.The defence secretary told Times Radio it is “possible to win the election”, but conceded that it is “not the most likely outcome”, adding: “I’m a realist.”Asked if a Tory victory was unlikely he replied: “I think that’s the realistic position, isn’t it? I mean, I live in the real world. So you know, let’s not try and pretend black is white.”Mr Shapps also said he stands by the comments he made last week that Labour could secure a “supermajority”.He said: “We’re still fighting for absolutely every single vote, which is absolutely the right thing to do and warning of the dangers of Labour.“But what I said last week stands, a blank cheque, a supermajority is a dangerous thing, particularly when we already know they have these plans to change the council tax bands.”Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said it would be ‘very bad news’ for the country if Labour leader Sir Keir won a ‘supermajority’ and was able to enter No 10 with his power ‘unchecked’ by Parliament (Maja Smiejkowska/PA) (PA Wire)Starmer and Farage also out on the campaign trail07:41 , Matt MathersSir Keir

Ms Mordaunt, who is in the Royal Navy Reserve herself, described her reception when she met veterans a few days later.“I’ve been out at a veterans’ event since, because we had the 42nd anniversary of the Falklands war [on Friday],” she said. “And so I was out with a lot of them then, and I got a very warm response from them.“I think it is what it is. I’m sure that the prime minister, if he could turn back time, would do something different. It’s done, and he was just right to apologise. There’s nothing else that he could have done, I think, in that circumstance.”The campaign has seen many setbacks for the Conservatives right from the start, when the nation watched the prime minister get drenched as he announced a snap election in a rain-sodden Downing Street.But with less than three weeks to go, Ms Mordaunt still believes her party can turn its fortunes around.“We are the underdog, yes,” she said. “There are lots of pundits, and some politicians, saying it’s all a foregone conclusion. Of course, it’s not. It’s going to come down to what people do with their votes – and I’m fighting for my city, and I’m going to carry on fighting until the polls shut.“We’re getting a really good response from people [on the doorstep in Portsmouth]. We’ve helped a lot of people, and they know who I am, and what I’ve done, and what I stand for.”The D-Day 80th anniversary in Portsmouth, Ms Mordaunt’s constituency (AP)She added: “A poll is a poll. It’s just statistics, but it’s not reflected from our experience on the doors here.”Ms Mordaunt laughed at the idea that she is a “celebrity politician”, but admits that fame has its advantages.“People know me,” she explained. “I don’t have to introduce myself, but it’s been great. And it’s just been really pleasant, actually chatting to people, and I think we’ve been offering the right things.”She is also clear that taxes are the way for the Tories to turn things around, even though a Techne UK poll for The Independent revealed that trust in her party over the issue has collapsed.In an apparent message to her party leadership, she also pushed for tax cuts after reports that cabinet ministers had pushed for more in the manifesto.“There are some blue skies ahead, and now’s the point where we need to go further on those tax cuts,” she said. “As the campaign has gone on, people have been raising concerns back to me. There’s distrust there, because of Labour’s previous record of being in government and what they’ve done elsewhere.“[Labour’s] taxes – that’s always bitten this city hard. With fuel duty, [there are] traders here, freight is important here, and people remember Labour’s fuel duty escalator – and we’ve frozen fuel duty for 14 years because we understand that is critical, not just to motorists and freight, but to people’s supermarket bills as well.”Ms Mordaunt says Rishi Sunak ‘rightly’ apologised for leaving the D-Day commemoration early (Sky News)She insists that her city’s experience of a Labour government before 2010 is why she believes that her party needs to keep fighting to the end.“I feel really strongly about stopping a Labour government. Last time they were in power, it meant, here in Portsmouth, we had the worst MRSA infections in a hospital in the country; [we had the] worst maths results. We had raw sewage running off Portsdown Hill. We had terrible flooding.“Cosham town centre was underwater in the winter. We had 600 kids playing truant for more than six months out of the school year. It was terrible, and taxes were high. We had tax-credit maladministration. It was awful.”She is less willing to address the future beyond 4 July though, including her own potential leadership ambitions or the possibility of Nigel Farage joining the Tories.“It really isn’t about us, you know, as individual politicians. It’s about the country, and it’s about my community.”While Ms Mordaunt is not pencilled in for any more TV debates, she said she is willing to go into battle again if there is a “Deploy! Deploy! Deploy!” command from CCHQ (Conservative Campaign Headquarters).She insists there was little preparation ahead of her appearances, which saw her dominate both debates with ferocious attacks on Labour’s deputy leader Angela Rayner.“I’m not particularly precious,” she said. “I know what I want to say and just go for it.”And Ms Mordaunt has sought to quash speculation that her hair – which became a social media phenomenon during the first debate – was a deliberate tactic.“I’m afraid no thought went into it whatsoever,” she explains. “On both occasions, someone else did my hair. I had other things to concentrate on.”After her second debate, The Independent revealed some of the misogynistic comments made on a Tory members’ Facebook group about her. But Ms Mordaunt shrugs such comments off.“I tend not to worry about these kinds of things,” she said. “But look, I’m a 51-year-old woman, I’ve had a fair deal in my lifetime, but it shouldn’t stop you doing anything. I don’t give it a second thought.”"

The Independent,Grant Shapps admits Tories ‘unlikely’ to win election as Sunak urged to ‘go for jugular’ on Starmer,[],Archie Mitchell,17 June 2024 at 11:33 am·5-min read,17,June,2024,11:33:00,5,"Grant Shapps has admitted the Conservatives are unlikely to win the general election, saying he is a realist and pleading with voters to help prevent a massive Labour majority instead.The defence secretary said he would not “pretend black is white” by claiming Rishi Sunak is on course to remain prime minister, adding it is “not the most likely outcome”.And while he said a Tory win is still possible, he said he lives “in the real world” and warned of “the dangers of Labour” if Sir Keir Starmer enters Downing Street with what he called a supermajority.Grant Shapps said he ‘lives in the real world’ (PA Wire)Mr Sunak meanwhile is being urged to “go for the jugular” and launch more direct personal attacks against Sir Keir to turn round the Tories’ faltering campaign.The prime minister has been warned he has not focused enough on the Labour leader and he needs to go after Sir Keir’s record. With the Conservatives still more than 20 points behind Labour in the polls, cabinet ministers have called for a change in direction and questioned whether the PM is comfortable enough launching personal attacks against his opponents.They are now focused on damage limitation, with Tory sources hoping the party can hold onto 140 or more seats – which would still see Sir Keir become PM with a significant majority.Click here for our live coverage of the general election campaign.Asked on Times Radio if a Tory victory was unlikely, Mr Shapps said: “I think that’s the realistic position, isn’t it? I mean, I live in the real world. So you know, let’s not try and pretend black is white.”But he insisted: “We’re still fighting for absolutely every single vote, which is absolutely the right thing to do, and warning of the dangers of Labour.”Penny Mordaunt said the election is not a foregone conclusion (AFP/Getty)His intervention came after Penny Mordaunt, seen as a leadership contender if Mr Sunak stepped down after the election, painted the Conservative Party as the underdog in the election campaign. In an interview with The Independent, Ms Mordaunt said: “There are lots of pundits, and some politicians, saying it’s all a foregone conclusion. Of course it’s not. It’s going to come down to what people do with their votes – and I’m fighting for my city, and I’m going to carry on fighting until the polls shut.”Mr Sunak on Monday insisted the Conservatives are “on the right track”, despite Mr Shapps’s comments.Speaking from Centrica’s Rough 47-3B gas rig, the PM said: “There’s still two and a half weeks to go in this election, I’m fighting hard for every vote because I believe we can win.“And there’s a very clear choice at this election: it’s having your taxes cut by the Conservatives or facing significant tax rises with the Labour Party.”But, speaking to The Times, cabinet figures called for Mr Sunak to go after Sir Keir’s work as a human rights lawyer, his support for ex-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his calls for a second Brexit referendum.One said: “Rishi is a really nice and deeply honourable guy. I’m not sure whether he’s uncomfortable instinctively with the personalised attacks but it has been more generalised so far.“He will sign a deal with the French, he will undo Brexit, he will rip apart our institutions. The guy’s a socialist, and there’s a real chance people will give him a free rein if they back Reform.”Another said: “He needs to make it personal. I think he was very badly affected by D-Day but he needs to go after Starmer now ... I don’t think there are any other options left.”Mr Sunak returned to the campaign trail on Monday (PA Wire)The minister was referring to Mr Sunak’s disastrous decision to leave early during commemorations for the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings.Another senior Tory told The Times: “Rishi needs to go for the jugular. His natural instincts are not to go for the jugular. That can be useful. But it’s not useful when you’re in a fight to the death. The question is whether the Tories will end up with closer to 100 seats or closer to 200.”An ally of the PM pointed to his attacks on Sir Keir during the first head-to-head debate on ITV in which Mr Sunak referenced the Labour leader’s past work as a defence lawyer on behalf of radical cleric Abu Qatada.Another perceived weakness among Tories is Sir Keir’s past support for Mr Corbyn, which saw him come unstuck during a grilling by Sky News presenter Beth Rigby.Under repeated questioning, Sir Keir said he only campaigned for a Labour win in 2019 because he wanted good Labour MPs to keep their seats and was “certain we would lose”.Labour Party leader Keir Starmer’s previous support for Jeremy Corbyn is seen as a weakness by some Tories (PA Wire)Labour has promised not to rejoin the EU single market if it wins the election.Asked about calls for Mr Sunak to “go for the jugular”, Mr Shapps told Sky News: “It is right that we highlight the risks of an unchecked Labour majority … because people need to know what they would be getting which is a heck of a lot more tax to pay in every direction.”He stressed that the Conservatives are the underdogs at the election but claimed “I still think we can do it”. Mr Shapps added: “I really think it’s important to warn people that voting any other way apart from Conservative guarantees a Labour-Starmer government.“Now, if that’s what you want, then fine. But, actually, if you don’t relish the idea of Starmer coming in, raising your taxes, having no plan for illegal migration … voting any other way than Conservative would be dangerous because it would allow Starmer a blank cheque to do those things and many other things besides.”"
The Telegraph,Starmer dismisses Farage ‘noise’ and says election race between Labour and Tories,[],Dominic Penna,17 June 2024 at 10:01 am·2-min read,17,June,2024,10:01:00,2,"Sir Keir Starmer dismissed “noises off” from Nigel Farage as he said the election was a two-horse race between Labour and the Conservatives.The Labour leader said voters had a “simple choice” between him and Rishi Sunak amid the growing popularity of Reform since Mr Farage returned to front line politics.A YouGov poll last week was the first to show Reform on a greater share of the vote than the Tories, with the party polling at its highest-ever levels in the past fortnight.Speaking to reporters during a visit to Southampton, Sir Keir said: “The election is a straight choice between more of the same under the Conservatives and rebuilding the country with us. There are only two candidates for prime minister.“We are absolutely focused on talking to people about what matters to them. That’s where my focus is, not the noises off. You certainly get a lot of noise from Nigel Farage, but I’m focused on the choice at this election.”Sir Keir also declined to say whether he agreed with Lord Cameron, the Foreign Secretary, who criticised Mr Farage’s “highly inflammatory language” and accused him of “dog whistle politics”.“The choice on July 4 is a choice of two different governments,” he said. “All the noises off don’t change that simple choice.”Sir Keir’s remarks came after he took part in a question-and-answer session with Rachel Reeves, his shadow chancellor, about their plans for the economy and green investment.He said Labour would not take the UK back into the European Union but would instead seek to renegotiate the post-Brexit deal between Britain and the bloc, saying there was a “better deal to be had”.In a swipe at the Government, Sir Keir added: “I think there has been too much self-entitlement in politics recently. We want to return it to service. That means it will be your government.”Sir Keir also said he was “very glad” he had campaigned for Labour at the 2019 election while serving as the shadow Brexit secretary under Jeremy Corbyn .“I campaigned for the Labour Party, I’ve always campaigned for the Labour Party,” he said. “And I wanted to make sure that good colleagues were returned and really good colleagues were returned – Yvette [Cooper], Ed [Miliband], Bridget [Phillipson], people like that, who might otherwise have lost their seats and are now a central part of the shadow cabinet.“So I’m very glad I campaigned good and hard for Labour at the last election.”Last week, the Labour leader was unable to clarify why he had told voters Mr Corbyn would make a “great prime minister”, only to subsequently suspend his predecessor amid a row over anti-Semitism in the party."
The National,Alba Party on course to win seats in Scotland at Holyrood election – new poll,[],James Walker,17 June 2024 at 11:11 am·2-min read,17,June,2024,11:11:00,2,"ALBA are set to win seats in Scotland at the next Holyrood election, according to new analysis.The poll from Norstat put support for Alex Salmond’s party at 5% in the regional vote, with Ballot Box Scotland (BBS) suggesting this could lead to a return of three MSPs.The same poll also put support for Reform UK at 7% among Scots in the regional vote, with the analysis suggesting this could lead to a return of nine MSPs – just one less than both the Scottish Greens and the Liberal Democrats.The poll, meanwhile, put the SNP narrowly ahead of Labour in both the constituency and list vote with returns of 39 and 37 MSPs respectively.The Conservatives returned 21 MSPs off the back of the analysis.Ballot Box Scotland urged caution when it comes to the Norstat results, however, saying that they are ""the only pollster finding this much support for Alba"".When it comes to the support for Reform UK, they added: ""Ahead of 2016, their predecessor party Ukip had a run of polls suggesting they’d get into Holyrood.""They got 2% and nowhere close.""Likewise, under their previous title of the Brexit Party, at the peak of their relevance in summer 2019 they were projected to elect MSPs.""2026 is a good while off, but my gut instinct is we’re just seeing the same thing: a spike in support and interest due to events at other levels of election, that won’t be sustained all the way to 2026.""READ MORE: Alex Salmond attacks SNP over ‘half-hearted’ campaign on independenceIt comes as Alex Salmond announced earlier this month that he wants to return to Holyrood and will contest the Banff and Buchan Coastal seat at the 2026 poll, but said he did not want to run in July’s General Election.Speaking at a press conference in central London on June 5, Salmond also said “it is agonising” to see the SNP poll behind the Labour Party, saying they had “thrown away” his work in replacing them as the dominant force in Scottish politics.Salmond said he had elected to run for Holyrood because Alba were more focused winning there than Westminster.The party also announced its ambition to “secure 20 or more seats in the Scottish Parliament” at the next election.Salmond said: “I shall be a candidate in the Banff and Buchan Coastal seat at the Scottish elections in 2026.“From that candidacy and from that platform, I hope to lead Alba into an independence coalition in the Scottish Parliament, a coalition which will be serious about independence and serious about the achievement of independence.”Alba have been approached for comment."
