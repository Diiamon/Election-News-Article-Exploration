The Telegraph,Which constituency am I in? How election boundary changes will affect you,"['Why is my constituency changing?', 'What will boundary changes mean for today’s election?']",Ben Butcher,4 July 2024 at 4:05 am·2-min read,4,July,2024,04:05:00,2,"Follow The Telegraph’s latest general election live blogConstituency boundaries will see their largest shake up in a generation at the general election as millions of households will be effected by dramatic changes to the political map.Some 2.9 million people would have been represented by an MP of a different party had the new boundaries been in play in 2019, analysis by The Telegraph shows.With the country heading to the polls today, find out whether boundary changes have pushed you into a new political area and this might impact your vote.Why is my constituency changing?Respective boundary commissions in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are required to carry out reviews every five years.These are done to ensure that populations across the country’s 650 constituencies remain consistent, ensuring areas are not over or under-represented in Parliament as demographics change over time.Around 76 constituencies will be increased in size when the country heads to the polls on July 4, while 73 will be reduced. Just 105 of the 150 areas will see little or no change compared to the last election.Read the latest election pollsMeanwhile, around one in three constituencies will be split into three or more new areas.These include Stone, a Staffordshire constituency held by the Conservative Sir Bill Cash since 1997, which will be split into five constituencies and Ogmore, a Labour-held constituency in South Wales, which will also be broken up into three new areas.Analysis from the Press Association shows that, had the 2019 election been held within the new boundaries, the Conservatives would have secured a 94-seat majority. This was 14-seats higher than the 80-seat majority gained with the old boundaries.What will boundary changes mean for today’s election?The changes mean Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, will have to achieve a swing of 12.7 points from the Conservatives – larger than the 10.2-point swing Tony Blair achieved in his 1997 landslide.Despite this, around 1.9 million people have been moved into new constituencies where Labour’s vote share was estimated to be at least 10 points higher than in their previous constituencies.This includes over 24,000 in the constituency of Meriden, where the Labour vote share was 29 per cent in 2019. Because of the boundary changes, this group will now be in Birmingham Hodge Hill and Solihull North, where Labour is estimated to have 60 per cent of the vote.On the other hand, around 1.7 million people are moved into far more Conservative areas, with a vote share 10 points higher than their old constituency.Around 71,600 voters in Labour-held Batley and Spen, for example, are moving into the new Spen Valley constituency. These voters will therefore move from an area that voted Labour in 2019 but would have voted Conservative under the new borders."

At this point, broadcasters will announce the results of the combined BBC, ITV and Sky News exit poll. By 4am there should be enough votes in to know which party is on course to victory.Here is a breakdown of exactly when to expect the key results on general election night:The election is being held using new constituency boundaries, which means the results cannot be compared directly with what happened at the last general election in 2019.To measure how well the parties do at the election, and to determine which seats they need to win to form a government, a set of notional results for the 2019 election has been calculated to show what would have happened if that contest had taken place using the new boundaries.All majorities and swings mentioned below are based on these notional results, which have been compiled by Professor Colin Rallings and Professor Michael Thrasher of the University of Plymouth, on behalf of the BBC, ITN, Sky News and PA news agency.10pm - Polls close followed by exit pollPolling stations close, followed immediately by the publication of the joint exit poll from the BBC, ITV and Sky News.It will offer the first clues as to how the night will unfold. At each of the past few elections, the exit poll has produced a very accurate projection of the actual result.Meanwhile, counting begins at venues across the UK for all 650 election results.(PA Graphics)11pm - First seats declaredThe first seats to declare are likely to be Blyth & Ashington at around 11.30pm and Houghton & Sunderland South at around 11.45pm. Both are in North East England and both are being defended by Labour.Houghton & Sunderland South has been won by Bridget Phillipson for Labour at every election since the seat was created in 2010. She is defending a narrow majority of 3,271.Blyth & Ashington is a new constituency at this election, with Labour defending a notional majority of 6,118.The outcome may provide a guide as to what to expect in seats where Labour has small majorities – in particular how Reform UK performs and what happens to the level of Conservative support.12am - A snapshot of the night aheadSwindon South is likely to be the first battleground seat of the night to declare at around 12.15am. Former justice secretary Sir Robert Buckland is defending a majority of 5,650 and Labour candidate Heidi Alexander – who was MP for Lewisham East from 2010-18 – needs a swing of 5.7 percentage points to win.Opinion polls suggest this is the sort of seat Labour ought to win comfortably, and as such the result will be a pointer for what could happen over the rest of the night.(PA Graphics)Basildon & Billericay in Essex is another result due at around 12.15am. Conservative Party chair Richard Holden is the party’s candidate due to a decision made by party officials just two days before the nominations deadline, to the anger of some local party members. The Tories are defending a 20,749 majority.Broxbourne in Hertfordshire is due at around 12.30am. The seat has been held continuously by the Conservatives since its creation in 1983, with a majority in 2019 of 19,192. The result will give an early indication of how the Tories are faring in their traditional Home Counties heartlands.1am - How does Scotland fare?East Kilbride & Strathaven, Hamilton & Clyde Valley and Rutherglen will provide a first indication of patterns of voting in Scotland.All three are being defended by the SNP and all are Labour targets, with Rutherglen needing a 6-percentage point swing to change hands, Hamilton & Clyde Valley 8.2 points and East Kilbride & Strathaven 12.8 points.A direct swing in the share of the vote of 10 percentage points from the SNP to Labour in Scotland could see Sir Keir Starmer’s party pick up 15 constituencies.(PA Graphics)Elsewhere, the Liberal Democrats could make their first gain of the night in Harrogate & Knaresborough, which they last held between 1997 and 2010 and where they need an 8-percentage point swing to take the seat from the Conservatives, ranking it at number 21 on the party’s target list.Leigh & Atherton in Greater Manchester is ranked at number two on Labour’s target list: a new seat this election, but one where the Tories are defending a notional majority of just 293.2am - It all kicks off The flow of results will now start to pick up, with just over 60 seats due to declare between 2am and 3am.A win for Labour in Tory-held Cannock Chase in Staffordshire, expected to declare at around 2.30am, would suggest the party is on course for a record-breaking win: the seat needs an enormous 21.5-percentage point swing to change hands, ranking it at number 304 on Labour’s target list.The party held the seat from 1997 to 2010 but it has been Tory ever since, with a 2019 majority of 19,879.The Lib Dems should discover whether they have been able to gain one of their longshots, Stratford-on-Avon, from the Conservatives: a seat they need a 17.8-point swing to win and which was held until this year by former Tory chancellor Nadhim Zahawi, who is not standing this time.Workers’ Party leader George Galloway will learn if he has held on to Rochdale in Greater Manchester, which he won at a by-election in February.Results from Sir Keir Starmer’s constituency of Holborn & St Pancras is due at around 2.30am (AFP via Getty Images)The result from Sir Keir Starmer’s constituency of Holborn & St Pancras is due at around 2.30am. The Labour leader is defending a very safe majority of 22,766 and is one of 12 candidates standing in the seat.Mid Bedfordshire, due to declare at around 2.45am, was won by Labour from the Tories at a by-election in October 2023, marking the first time Sir Keir’s party had represented the seat since its creation in 1918.Based on the size of the swing Labour needs to win again (when compared with the 2019 notional result), the seat ranks at number 263 on the party’s target list – so a Labour victory here would suggest the party is on track for an enormous Commons majority.Also worth watching will be the results from Bolsover in Derbyshire, held by Labour from 1950 to 2019 – for much of the time by veteran left-winger Dennis Skinner – until the Tories won at the last election, and which Labour will hope to win back; Peterborough and Redcar, two of Labour’s key targets; and Torbay in Devon, which could fall to the Lib Dems if Sir Ed Davey’s party is doing exceptionally well.3am - Watching with bated breathThis is likely to be the busiest time of the night, with nearly 250 declarations expected over the next hour.Islington North is due to declare, where independent candidate and former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is standing. Mr Corbyn has previously won the seat for Labour at every general election since 1983, but is no longer a member of the party and is contesting the seat with six others, including Labour candidate Praful Nargund.The result is due from the new seat of Great Grimsby & Cleethorpes, where the Tories are defending a notional majority of 9,759: the sort of constituency Labour has to win (the swing needed is 11.8 points) to be sure of a comfortable majority.(PA Graphics)Justice secretary Alex Chalk is one of the cabinet ministers most at risk at this election and the result from his seat of Cheltenham is due at around 3am, where he is defending a tiny majority of 1,421.The constituency would fall to the Lib Dems on a swing of 1.3 percentage points, ranking it at number six on the party’s target list.The result is also due at around 3am from Chingford & Wood Green, which former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith has won at every general election (including its former incarnation as Chingford) since 1992, but where he is defending a majority of just 1,604 and which would change hands on a swing to Labour of 1.5 points.Five other candidates are standing, including Shama Tatler for Labour and the Independent Faiza Shaheen, who was Labour’s candidate here in 2019, meaning there could be a partial split in the Labour vote.Sir Ed Davey’s seat of Kingston & Surbiton is due to declare at around 3.15am, where the Lib Dem leader is defending a majority of 11,174.Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey’s seat is due to be declared after 3am (PA Wire)Witney in Oxfordshire, a seat won by the Tories at every election since its creation in 1983 and which was once represented by former prime minister David Cameron, is due to declare at this time – another seat that could fall to the Lib Dems if Sir Ed’s party is having a very strong night.Also due at around 3.15am is the result from Bristol Central: a new seat at this election and one of the Green Party’s top targets, where candidate Carla Denyer is hoping to beat Labour’s Thangam Debbonaire, previously MP for Bristol West.At around 3.30am the result is likely from the new constituency of Godalming & Ash in Surrey, where chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt is one of six candidates. Mr Hunt could be at risk: he is defending a notional Tory majority of 10,720 and the seat has been heavily targeted by the Lib Dems, who need a swing of 9.7 points to win.(PA Graphics)Defence secretary Grant Shapps is another Tory “big beast” potentially in trouble and the result from his Hertfordshire seat of Welwyn Hatfield should come in around this time. Mr Shapps has held the seat since 2005 but is defending a majority of 10,773 and Labour needs a swing of 10.4 percentage points to win.House of Commons leader Penny Mordaunt will find out if she has held her seat of Portsmouth North, which she has represented since 2010. She is defending a majority of 15,780 and a swing to Labour of 17.2 points would see her defeated.Another cabinet minister, education secretary Gillian Keegan, will discover her fate at Chichester. Ms Keegan is defending a majority at this election of 19,622, with second-place party the Lib Dems needing a swing of 19.3 points to take a seat they last held – as the Liberal Party – 100 years ago.Tatton in Cheshire, once the seat of former chancellor George Osborne and held since 2017 by government minister and TV presenter Esther McVey, is due to declare, which would fall to Labour on a 17.4-point swing.Other key seats to watch this hour include Ribble Valley in Lancashire, Thanet East in Kent and Scarborough & Whitby in North Yorkshire – all seats Labour needs to win to be sure of a majority in the next parliament – along with Tory-Lib Dem battlegrounds such as Eastleigh in Hampshire, Wells & Mendip Hills in Somerset and Newton Abbot in Devon, to see how well the Conservatives hold off any potential surge by Sir Ed’s party in south-west England.4am - Time to face the musicEnough results should be in now to know which party is on course to win the election and by what margin.Dartford in Kent is the longest-running “bellwether” constituency in the country and is due to declare at around 4am. Since 1964, whichever party wins Dartford has also gone on to form the government. Conservative candidate Gareth Johnson is defending a majority here of 14,704, with Labour’s Jim Dickson needing a swing of 15.9 points to take the seat.Douglas Alexander, who held a number of cabinet roles during the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, has not been an MP since 2015 but is standing this year in Lothian East, Labour’s top target in Scotland where the SNP is defending a majority of 2,207.Rishi Sunak’s seat of Richmond & Northallerton, in North Yorkshire, should declared at around this time. The prime minister is defending a huge notional majority of 24,331 and is one of 13 candidates standing in the constituency, making it the most contested seat in the country.Clacton in Essex should declare. It is being defended by Giles Watling for the Conservatives and Reform leader Nigel Farage is one of nine candidates. It is Mr Farage’s eighth attempt at becoming an MP.The residents of Ashfield in Nottinghamshire will find out at around 4.30am if their next MP is former Conservative-turned-Reform candidate Lee Anderson, who won the seat as a Tory in 2019; Independent candidate Jason Zadrozny, who came second in 2019; new Conservative candidate Debbie Soloman; or Rhea Keehn for Labour, whose party held the seat from 1979 to 2019.(PA Graphics)Former House of Commons leader Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg will learn if he has won the new seat of Somerset North East & Hanham, where the notional Tory majority is 16,389 and which Labour would take on a swing of 14.3 percentage points, ranking it at number 165 on the party’s target list.The Greens will discover whether they have held on to Brighton Pavilion in East Sussex, where Caroline Lucas was the party’s MP from 2010 to this year, and where their new candidate is Sian Berry.They will also find out if the Greens’ co-leader Adrian Ramsay has managed to win the new seat of Waveney Valley in East Anglia, which is being treated as a notional Conservative defence.A key result from Northern Ireland is due at around 4.30am in Lagan Valley, where Sinn Fein has stood aside in the hope of giving the Alliance Party a better chance of gaining the seat from the DUP.5am - Rayner’s time to shineNorthampton North, a bellwether seat at every general election since February 1974, is due to declare. Labour needs a 3.9-point swing to gain the constituency from the Tories.(PA Graphics)Former prime minister Liz Truss will learn whether she is back in her seat of Norfolk South West, where she is defending an enormous majority of 24,180.The Leicestershire constituency of Loughborough, a bellwether at every general election since February 1974, is due to declare at around 5.30am. Labour needs a 5.9-point swing to gain the seat from the Tories.Also due at around 5.30am is the result from Ashton-under-Lyne in Greater Manchester, where Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner is defending a majority of 4,689.Two of the most remote constituencies in Scotland should declare during this hour: Caithness, Sutherland & Easter Ross and Orkney & Shetland, both of which the Lib Dems are hoping to win, while results should come in for two of Labour’s top London targets: Finchley & Golders Green and Hendon, both held since 2010 by the Conservatives.6am - The final hoursAmong the final results to declare should be the London boroughs of Ilford North and Ilford South, both safe for Labour.Another likely to be called is the new constituency of Selby in North Yorkshire, which Keir Mather – the youngest MP at the end of the last parliament – is hoping to win for Labour and overturn a notional Tory majority of 14,838.Farnham & Bordon, a new seat that straddles the borders of Hampshire and Surrey, which could bring the Lib Dems a late gain at the expense of the Conservatives.7am and later - The morning after Recounts could delay some of the declarations from earlier, but every seat is due to begin counting overnight so there is a good chance all 650 results will be in by mid-morning.Additional reporting by PA"
Yahoo News UK,Who is Ed Davey? The Lib Dem leader whose life has been marked by adversity,"['His early life', 'His family', 'His parents', 'His education', 'Why is he a Sir?']",Hannah Fearn,Updated 1 July 2024 at 11:04 am·3-min read,1,July,2024,11:04:00,3,"The youngest of three boys, Sir Ed Davey had a childhood marked by adversity. His mother died when he was a teenager and his father died when he was just four.As an adult, Davey now cares for his son, who is disabled with a neurological condition.So what do we know about the man who leads the third party in British politics?His early lifeEd Davey was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on Christmas Day in 1965. He was the youngest of three boys, but lost his father at just four years old and then his mother when he was in his mid-teens. She had spent three years battling cancer, during which time he nursed his mother together with his grandmother and brother Henry.Once a keen Scout and Air Scout, he later remembers feeling “isolated” at school because of his caring responsibilities, which meant he couldn’t take part in after-school activities or sports. “The last 18 months she was bedridden and in a lot of pain. I’d spend hours on the bed, talking to her,” he said. Davey was with his mother when she died at Nottingham General Hospital, after being placed on an unsuited dementia ward.After both his parents had died, Davey was brought up by his maternal grandparents in the village of Eakring, though his grandfather died soon after. He spent much of his childhood and young adulthood close to his grandmother. “First of all, she was looking after me. Then we were looking after each other,” he said.His familyDavey married Emily Gasson, a former Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate who unsuccessfully stood in four elections and is now a councillor, in 2005 and the pair have two children, a son and daughter.Their son, John, born in 2007 and now a teenager, is disabled with a neurological condition. He has attended special schools but is now educated at home with a tutor – a change that Davey said led to him becoming verbal for the first time. He has spoken about his anxiety about who will care for his son when he and his wife are no longer around. “It’s the thing that worries me more than anything else in my life,” Davey said.Gasson was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in 2012. She was well for many years following her diagnosis, but declined during lockdown and is working on recovering her physical strength.His parentsEd Davey, pictured with his family. (Liberal Democrats)His father, John, was a solicitor and his mother, Nina, a teacher. Davey has described how he was inspired to study by his mother, who always wanted him to try hard academically and who he wanted to impress.His educationDavey attended the private Nottingham High School, the alma mater of former chancellor Kenneth Clarke. He became head boy, with Labour MP Ed Balls – who was studying in the year below – watching on.After school, he achieved a first class degree in philosophy, politics and economics at Jesus College, Oxford where he was junior common room president. After becoming an economics researcher for the Liberal Democrats he returned to study, reading for a master’s degree in economics at Birkbeck College, London.Ed Davey as Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change alongside the then leader of the Lib Dems, Nick Clegg, and Jo Swinson, pictured during the coalition government in 2015.

If you haven’t already registered to vote you’ve already missed the deadline and won’t be able to cast a ballot this time around.But, you can still apply for an emergency proxy vote as late as 5pm on polling day if you are suddenly unable to vote in person, so long as you are already registered.New rules and boundary changes mean you must have a valid photo ID to vote and your constituency may be different to the last election – you can use your postcode to check.Officially, polls close at 10pm, but if you are at least in the queue by then you should still be able to cast your vote past time.After that, votes are taken to counting halls run by the relevant local authority, ready to be sorted.From 10pm media can also start reporting exit polls, which given an early indication of how the parties are performing across the country.When are votes counted?First, ballots have to make it from polling stations to the counting hall, which could take minutes or hours, depending how far they have to travel.Once there, slips are verified to ensure they match data from their polling stations (such as the number of ballots issued throughout the day), before being mixed with postal votes for counting to begin in earnest.When should we expect the first results?A handful of seats usually manage to declare a result before midnight.Traditionally, this honour has fallen to one of the Sunderland constituencies, although at the last two elections, in 2019 and 2017, that crown was snatched by Newcastle Central.This time around, however, Newcastle has reportedly ruled itself out of the running for the top spot.Sunderland is usually one of the first areas to begin announcing election results.So does that mean I can have an early-ish night?That depends. In 2019, one of the most significant results of the night was confirmed barely 90 minutes after close of polls (and that included a recount).There was a similar phenomenon in Sunderland during the Brexit referendum, when the scale of the result on Wearside gave an early indication of the final outcome.But with votes for 650 seats across the UK to count, you might be advised to stay up a little later if you’re really interested.Okay, so when can I think about going to bed?How early do you have to get up the next day?In 2019, returning officers managed to confirm almost 50 seats before 2am – a great improvement on 2015, when the figure was just 17.On the basis of the last two elections (which, like this one, were standalone polls without local authority and other votes going on at the same time, as happened in 2015), the bulk of results came between 2-5am, when results were being declared at a rate of almost three every minute.And will there be a result by then?Maybe. The magic number for a parliamentary majority is 326 seats, although in reality the actual number is slightly lower due to various factors.If a party pulled off the slightly implausible achievement of winning 326 seats consecutively, a result could be confirmed by about 3.30am, again, on the basis of previous elections.In reality, the process will likely take a lot longer.Which will be the last seat to declare?Probably St Ives, in Cornwall, which has taken the wooden spoon in two of the last three elections.In 2015 and 2019 it was well past lunchtime the day after the election before a result was declared.But in 2017 Kensington didn't confirm a shock victory in the seat until 9pm the day after, thanks to three recounts, although by that point the national result was a foregone conclusion.Who is standing in my constituency?Find your constituency on the map below to see the list of the candidates from the main political parties standing in your local area.If you aren't sure of the full name of your constituency, you can quickly search for its name by adding your postcode or location here.You can also check out our searchable database below to see a list of all the candidates standing in your area."

The Independent,Love Islanders share their political insights on the UK’s general election,[],Maira Butt,4 July 2024 at 4:17 am·3-min read,4,July,2024,04:17:00,3,"Every year, the charming Love Island contestants venture out of their areas of expertise – flirting, chatting, discussing the endless nuances of “icks”– and into the uncharted terrain of current affairs.From the legendary Brexit analysis of 2018, in which an alarmed Hayley Hughes thought that a departure from the European Union would spell the end of trees as we know them, to not knowing the difference between a country and a continent, the show has left us with some unforgettable insights.Now, the latest cohort have lent their thoughts to the most monumental political moment since the referendum, and shared their thoughts on the UK’s general election.In an episode of Love Island Unseen Bits, the girls are seen discussing the government, as retail manager Jess asks, “What’s everyone’s opinion on the general election?”Uma, 23, is confused as she asks, “What’s that mean?”An unimpressed Jess responds, “Are you being serious?”Uma defends her knowledge as she ventures, “No, I know the prime... president...?”“Prime minister, babe.” Jess corrects, shortly.The Islanders ventured out of their comfort zone to discuss government (ITV/Love Island)“Prime minister, sorry.” says Uma.But Tiffany appears bored as she contributes: “I don’t know. I don’t really understand it all,” as Welshwoman Nicole agrees.“There is a vote right now isn’t there?” Uma asks the group.Some fans were confused about how the Islanders were aware of the election while they’ve been cooped up in the villa. However, the snap election was announced on 1 June while the 11th season of the dating show began on 7 June.Nicole and Mimii watched on (ITV/ Love Island)“There’s gonna be a general election soon but..” Jess continues before Uma interrupts to add, “Sadiq Khan is the current...”“It’s Rishi Sunak,” corrects Tiffany, clarifying that the mayor of London was not in the national government.Jess appears impatient as she teaches, “Not Sadiq Khan, it’s Rishi Sunak, it’s Conservatives that are in power at the minute...”And despite Tiffany stating she doesn’t understand politics, it appears she has more of a flair for economics as she notes, “A Freddo’s like 25p now...”Jess believes she would make a good prime minister (ITV/Love Island)Mimii asks whether there are any women in the running as Jess says “life would be better if women were in charge”.More confusion ensues as Uma adds, “But wasn’t it really bad when Margaret... I don’t know. I don’t want to say anymore.”Jess adds knowingly, “It wasn’t Margaret Thatcher, she was a long, long time ago.”“She lasted about two days didn’t she?” adds another contestantAs the villa’s resident fount of knowledge, Jess confirms: “Theresa May. That was the woman.”“There was another as well,” suggests Tiffany.“I think she’s been the only woman after Margaret Thatcher,” says Jess.“No, there was one more. She loved Taylor Swift,” Tiffany recalls, referring to the fleeting reign of former prime minister Liz Truss.Jess concludes the chat by suggesting, “I think I’d be quite a good prime minister,” as the girls agree.Sharing the policies she’d implement, she says, “I would make nails free to girls. I would make hair free to girls.”“That’s not a political party Jess, that’s just a party,” notes narrator and comedian Iain Stirling.Love Island continues tonight (4 July) at 9pm on ITV2 and ITVX."
The Telegraph,How to get rich from Keir Starmer in Number 10,"['The companies and sectors threatened by a Labour government', '...and the companies and sectors that could benefit', 'The companies and sectors immune from government interference', 'How will the stock market as a whole react to a Labour victory?', 'What would you buy to profit in the event of a Labour government? Or would you sell everything?

But just before Christmas, Beijing gave us an object lesson in how the actions of governments can decimate share prices.The Chinese Communist Party announced restrictions on the incentives that gaming companies can offer to users to encourage them to play. The move caused shares in Tencent, one of China’s internet giants and publisher of the popular Fortnite game, to fall by 16pc at one point.Giant companies such as Tencent are not supposed to experience such dramatic price changes. If a FTSE 100 company lost 16pc in a day it would be front-page news.ADVERTISEMENTThe decisions of the British government can and do affect share prices, however – in both directions.The value of Trainline, the rail and coach ticketing service, fell by 34pc in May 2021 when ministers said it would face competition from a new app when Britain’s trains were reorganised as Great British Railways. When that decision was reversed in December, shares in the company jumped by 11pc.On top of the numerous things that can cause unexpected upsets for the share price of any company, investors hardly need another in the form of government whims.Questor, the Telegraph’s share-tipping column, would be inclined to put at the top of any checklist of investment rules one such as “do not buy shares in any sector or company subject to government interference” were it not for the fact that so many sectors of the economy are nowadays subject to the vagaries of state action.We should of course bear in mind the possibility that such action can instead be positive for quoted companies in certain circumstances.If you believe the polls, Labour is strolling towards a big majority when Britain finishes voting today. Here follows our advice about how to navigate this thicket of threats and opportunities for your investments.The companies and sectors threatened by a Labour governmentIn Questor’s view, almost any large company, or any in the public eye, could find itself in the Government’s bad books – or indeed find itself seen simply as an acceptable source of funds to address some perceived public need.Story continuesAn obvious recent example is the windfall tax imposed on energy companies to pay for government support when prices rose after the invasion of Ukraine.Pious utterances from politicians about the need to offer business a predictable legislative framework, or to support green energy, are forgotten in the face of public calls for immediate but costly state assistance.So energy or fuel companies in all forms, whether they sell to the public directly or are further up the supply chain, are examples of those at risk from government action. The same applies to broadband or telephone companies and the mobile networks and, if perhaps to a lesser degree, to the supermarkets.When it comes to specific threats from the election of a Labour government, certain sectors look ripe for more regulation, windfall taxes or both.Top of the list are likely to be the privatised utilities and, in particular, the water companies, although in some cases their balance sheets are too strained to sustain large payments.Banks have found themselves targeted in the past, but Labour has already said it will not bring back restrictions on City bonuses may mark a sea change in attitudes to the sector.Labour has indicated that it is open to new thinking on the NHS, which could involve a shift away from treating diseases and towards preventing them. This could mean more pressure on tobacco companies and perhaps on alcohol businesses and producers of foods perceived to be unhealthy.That said, there have been substantial pressures on the hospitality sector since the pandemic – many pubs and restaurants have struggled with higher energy and food prices – and pouring petrol on that particular fire might play badly with the electorate....and the companies and sectors that could benefitGovernments have a complex relationship with business. While large companies or entire sectors can find themselves depicted as public enemy number one by politicians when it suits them, ministers are also aware that businesses and their employees pay enormous sums in tax, without which public services would grind to a halt.More prosaically, governments use private companies to carry out a huge amount of work on its behalf, from building tanks, planes and warships to providing computer systems to the public sector, not to mention a plethora of outsourcing contracts for various services.All this is true irrespective of which party is in power, so it is far from easy to identify any companies or sectors likely to benefit particularly from a Labour government.That said, we could speculate that Labour under Sir Keir might be less inclined than the Tories under Rishi Sunak to try to row back on net zero and green initiatives.Accordingly, it’s possible that companies involved with environmental improvement could be treated more favourably. Questor has tipped several investment trusts that pour money into green energy or into environmental assets more generally. Examples include Greencoat UK Wind, JLEN Environmental Assets and Impax Environmental Markets.Almost regardless of the election result, the housebuilding sector should receive a boost. It is a quick way to get the economy moving and, of course, to address Britain’s housing shortage. Labour has set a target to build 1.5 million new homes over the next parliament, taking a “brownfield first” approach before looking to develop on the green belt. Such site conversions are more expensive for the housebuilders, but could be encouraged with development grants.The companies and sectors immune from government interferenceWe say above that the businesses most exposed politically tend to be large and to deal directly with the public, or have at least a direct impact on the pockets of the public.If you want to minimise the possibility of political impact on your investments, look for smaller businesses that operate within the bowels of the economy far from the public consciousness.Examples abound, particularly outside the higher reaches of the FTSE 100 index – many have been tipped in the past by Questor.Relx springs to mind. It offers data, analysis and research to a wide variety of customers in academia, business and the public sector. It also operates around the globe. Questor cannot see it falling victim in any big way to individual measures put forward by Sir Keir or any other prime minister.Or Spirax-Sarco. A specialist engineer, it operates in niche fields such as steam systems and temperature management solutions. As another international company, it’s hard to see any actions of the British government having any major impact on its finances.A third example is Judges Scientific, which designs and produces scientific instruments.In fact, there are dozens if not hundreds more British companies that can operate profitably below the radar of politicians. For further examples you may want to browse through Questor’s tips.And of course foreign-listed companies, unless they happen to have significant operations in this country, will be beyond the reach of the British government, although it’s true that changes to the taxation in Britain of dividends or other returns made overseas could hit you in the pocket regardless.Again Questor has tipped many stocks listed abroad, particularly in our Monday columns.How will the stock market as a whole react to a Labour victory?Given the rate at which prime ministers (and chancellors) seem to come and go, investors may be inclined to avoid second-guessing the result of the general election.The FTSE All-Share index’s history shows that, on average, the market seems to prefer a Tory government. However, investors have plenty of reasons to take Sir Keir’s big lead in the polls, and any eventual victory, in their stride.This includes the lack of available cash in the Government’s kitty, the Conservatives’ occasionally frayed relationship with business and the likelihood that Labour took on board the lesson from “Trussonomics” that unfunded promises could prompt chaos.Labour’s pledge not to raise corporation tax won’t have done any harm in this respect either.In any event, the prospect of a government led by Sir Keir and Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, is unlikely to spark the sort of fear that would have been inspired by an administration whose driving forces were Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell.Russ Mould of AJ Bell and Rob Burgeman of RBC Brewin Dolphin contributed to this article.What would you buy to profit in the event of a Labour government?

The Guardian,Polling stations open across UK for general election,[],Eleni Courea and Aletha Adu,4 July 2024 at 3:39 am·5-min read,4,July,2024,03:39:00,5,"Keir Starmer, Rishi Sunak and Ed Davey have cast their ballots as voters across the UK head to the polls in a general election that is expected to produce the first Labour government in 14 years.The Labour leader and his wife, Victoria, appeared to have a spring in their step, smiling, as they made the short journey on foot from their home to vote in the Holborn and St Pancras constituency.The prime minister, who has been urged to stay on as Tory leader irrespective of how badly the Conservatives lose, was also joined by his wife, Akshata Murty, arriving at their Richmond polling station in a Range Rover.The Liberal Democrat leader waved to cameras as he voted in Surbiton with his wife, Emily, saying “good morning everybody” to the media gathered outside.It comes as polling stations in 650 constituencies across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland opened at 7am. Counting will begin immediately after they close at 10pm, with results announced in the early hours of Friday morning.Writing on X as the polls opened, Starmer, said: “Change. Today, you can vote for it.” Sunak posted a series of messages on the same site that urged voters to “stop the Labour supermajority”, which he claimed “would mean higher taxes for a generation”.The Lib Dems tweeted: “This election is our chance to win the change our country desperately needs.” The SNP tweeted: “VoteSNP to deliver independence, rejoin the EU, scrap the two-child benefit cap, invest in the just transition, protect free tuition.”The contest closes six weeks of campaigning after a five-year period in which the UK has had three Conservative prime ministers.defaultLabour has maintained its 20-point lead in opinion polls for the entirety of the election campaign and is hoping to make huge gains across England, Wales and Scotland. A YouGov poll published on Wednesday night said Starmer’s party was on track to win its largest majority in modern history.Senior Tories including one of Sunak’s closest cabinet allies were effectively conceding defeat on Wednesday. Starmer accused the Conservatives of trying to suppress voter turnout by presenting the election result as a done deal.Labour is seeking election on a platform of change, and has promised to create a new publicly owned energy company, nationalise the railways, cut net migration, recruit 6,500 teachers and create more than 100,000 new nursery places.The Conservatives have promised to introduce compulsory national service for 18-year-olds, introduce an annual cap on migrant visas, recruit 8,000 police officers and cut a further 2p off national insurance with a view to abolishing it.It would mark an unprecedented turnaround from the last election, held in December 2019, when Boris Johnson defeated Jeremy Corbyn to win an 80-seat majority for the Conservatives. His campaign was centred on the promise to “get Brexit done”.Less than three months into his premiership, Johnson had to contend with the Covid-19 pandemic. He resigned in July 2022 after losing the confidence of his MPs due to a string of scandals including Partygate and the handling of internal misconduct allegations.Johnson was succeeded by Liz Truss in September 2022, but her disastrous premiership lasted only 45 days. She was forced to resign after presenting a mini-budget that lost the confidence of the markets and caused the value of the pound to plummet to a historic low.Sunak, who was defeated by Truss in the 2022 Conservative leadership contest, took over but has failed to turn the Conservatives’ fortunes around.Starmer has been in office since April 2020 and has brought about a dramatic and ruthless transformation of his party during that time. He suspended Corbyn, in whose shadow cabinet he served, who is seeking election as an independent candidate in Islington North.Several of the smaller parties – the Liberal Democrats, Greens and Reform UK – are projected to perform well in this election.Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, has fronted a stunt-driven campaign that polls say is due to deliver dozens of seats in Conservative strongholds. The Liberal Democrats have pledged to introduce free personal care in England, give everyone the right to see their GP within seven days and ban sewage discharges into rivers and seas.The Greens are targeting disaffected leftwing voters in four seats including Bristol Central, which is being defended by the shadow culture secretary, Thangam Debbonaire. Their policies include a wealth tax on assets of more than £10m and bringing railways, water companies and the big five energy firms into public ownership.Reform UK is projected to win up to three seats, despite uproar about several of its candidates’ and activists’ racist and misogynistic remarks. Pollsters say Nigel Farage is likely to enter parliament on his eighth attempt with a victory in Clacton-on-Sea. His party wants to freeze immigration – except for those with essential skills – and end policies designed to reach net zero.A total of 650 MPs will be chosen under the first-past-the-post system, where the candidate who secures the most votes in each seat is elected. To win an overall majority, a political party must win more than half of these seats: at least 326.All British citizens aged 18 or over are eligible to vote, as are citizens of Commonwealth countries and Ireland who are resident in the UK. Voters must have registered to vote in advance and must take a valid form of voter ID to the polling station."

From finding a polling station to filling out your ballot09:46 , Salma OuaguiraVoters in the UK are visiting polling stations up and down the country to have their say in which political party they want to represent their area and country.Prime minister Rishi Sunak announced the snap general election at the end of May, sparking six frantic weeks of political campaigning. June has seen leaders, candidates and activists fight for every last vote: knocking on doors, taking part in televised debates, and trying to avoid controversy.Polling suggests the election will mark the end of 14 years of Conservative governance, with Labour flying ahead in projected voting intention. Some also predict smaller parties like the Lib Dems, Greens and Nigel Farage’s Reform UK could pick up record seats.The true picture will remain unclear until July 5, when the UK will wake up to a new administration. Before that, the electorate must take to their local polling stations to cast their votes (if they have not done so already via a postal vote).To ensure everyone gets a fair and equal chance to participate in this democratic process, there are a number of rules in place which must be followed in and around polling stations.Here’s everything you need to know about polling day:How to vote in the election today: Finding a polling station and filling in a ballotVoters concerned about environment and climate change12:19 , Salma OuaguiraWhile experts remind us of the existential threat posed by climate change, polls suggest the issue is only an important priority for about one in five voters, Jonathan Bunn reports. However, that is still a significant number of voters and the environment is an issue that concerns people across the political spectrum.Despite progress in the UK on cutting emissions, the Conservatives will likely have angered many of a green persuasion by introducing new oil and gas licences.Last year the watchdog the Climate Change Committee described efforts to scale up climate action as “worryingly slow”, with Government decisions undermining the UK’s leadership on the issue.Labour has also faced challenges on the environment.The decision to slash its green prosperity plan from £28 billion a year to £15 billion was heavily criticised by environmental groups and unions.Members of the public leave after casting their vote in the 2024 General Election at St James' Church, Goldenacre, in Edinburgh (Jane Barlow/PA Wire)Watch: Government expert explains how to vote even if you have lost your ID12:10 , Salma OuaguiraGovernment expert explains how to vote even if you have lost your IDTory Steve Baker could watch his seat fall12:00 , Salma OuaguiraSteve Baker was appointed minister of state at the Northern Ireland Office on 7 September 2022.

The election of 1900 was the first of its kind to be contested by the recently-formed Labour Party, as well as the long-established Conservative and Liberal parties, and as such can be seen as the first general election of the modern political era.Even larger majorities have been won by coalitions of parties.A three-party National government, made up mostly of Conservatives along with small portions of the Labour and Liberal parties, won a majority of 242 at the 1935 election.Four years earlier in 1931, the same National government won a majority of 492: the biggest ever parliamentary majority at a general election in modern political history.Largest majorities won by single parties at general elections since 1900 (PA Graphics) (PA Graphics)Sir Ed Davey and his wife vote in west London11:02 , Salma OuaguiraLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey and his wife, Emily, have visited a polling station in Surbiton to vote.Sir Ed said “good morning everybody” to the assembled media and waved to the cameras.As the pair prepared to enter Surbiton Hill Methodist Church, a voter left the polling station and wished Sir Ed “good luck”.Sir Ed Davey and his wife Emily Gasson arrive to cast their votes in the 2024 General Election at Surbiton Hill Methodist Church in Surbiton, south west London (AFP via Getty Images)Immigration set to be hotly debated as voters seek action11:01 , Salma OuaguiraImmigration consistently comes in third place in recent polling on voter priorities and is set to be a key battleground in the election campaign, Jonathan Bunn reports. The Government’s Rwanda Bill became law last month, paving the way for deportation flights to get off the ground.This policy and Tory talk of limits on legal migration show the Government is committed to taking a hard line on the issue, despite the risk of alienating more moderate voters.Meanwhile, Labour has said it is also looking to reduce the reliance on overseas workers and backs a points-based immigration system which it says “would work for workers and businesses”.Sir Keir Starmer has been treading carefully on the issue of small boats, saying crossings needed to be reduced “materially” without setting a target.He said a Labour government would expand counter-terror powers to cover people-smuggling gangs and create a new Border Security Command to co-ordinate efforts to halt the crossings.Rishi Sunak said stopping the boats was one of his five priorities last year, but  the number of migrants to have arrived in the UK in small boats across the Channel in 2024 is already approaching the 10,000 mark.With crossings continuing, the Conservatives may have to rely on the symbolic impact of at least one flight to Rwanda rather than firm evidence that the policy is working.The Prime Minister previously said flights to the east African country would not take off before the General Election (PA Archive)Aldi UK jokes about election for Cake Constituency MP10:57 , Canqi LiAldi UK has made a Facebook post featuring a ballot for electing an MP for a fictionary Cake Constituency, writing: “Democracy has never been sweeter #GeneralElection2024”.The featured parties include “The People’s Party”, “Legally a Different Party”, “The Overpriced Avocado Party”, “The Co-operative Party”, “Clubcard Members Party”, “The Attempted Price Match Party”, and “Just Here for a Good Time Party”.The post received more than 200 comments in half an hour, with one commenter writing: “Best ballot paper ever.”Another commenter remarked: “You are sooo naughty, Aldi!

This can be done by up to 5pm on polling day, and you must take ID.The authority’s elections office will usually be located at the town hall or the main council building. Most will offer the option to complete a ballot on site and hand it back to them, ensuring your vote is received.Alternatively, a replacement can also be sent by post up until 5pm on Wednesday 3 July or voters can authorise someone to collect it on their behalf, according to the Electoral Commission, which oversees elections in the UK.The independent elections body also offers a handy postcode checker to find the contact details of your local election team.You can read The Independent’s full advise here: Postal vote delays: What to do if yours hasn’t arrived before the general electionHow bad could the general election result be for the Tories?10:10 , Salma OuaguiraPolling guru Professor Sir John Curtice gave a final prediction ahead of the polls opening at the general election.British voters are heading to polling stations on Thursday to cast their ballots, six weeks after prime minister Rishi Sunak sought to surprise his opponents by calling the 4 July election earlier than expected.With Sir Keir Starmer’s party sustained its roughly 20-point lead in the polls over the course of the campaign, expert Prof Curtice shared his final thoughts in an opinion piece published before voting began at 7am on Thursday.Short of a dramatic turnaround, after the final opinion polls published on Wednesday the veteran polling expert had suggested that “it looks as though Sir Keir Starmer will become prime minister on Friday”.The Independent’s reporter Andy Gregory has more:Pollster John Curtice makes final prediction before polls open in general electionPlaid Cymru leader votes in Wales10:05 , Salma OuaguiraPLaid Cymru’s leader Rhun ap Iorweth has posted a video after he cast his ballot in Ynys Môn.In the X post, he said: “I’ve just voted for Llinos Medi and Plaid Cymru here on Ynys Môn.

Historically high waiting lists for treatment, ageing infrastructure across the NHS estate and workforce challenges combine to paint a picture of the much-loved health service on its knees.The Government made progress in reducing waiting times, but the scale of the problem means the figures remain at a level many voters will be disturbed by.Meanwhile, Labour promised to cut waiting times and increase appointments and operations.However, the scale of the issues in the NHS, the complexities across the system and wider related services, as well as the scale of funding involved, pose a huge challenge for whichever party wins power.Junior doctors in England began a five-day walkout during the general election campaign (Jordan Pettitt/PA) (PA Wire)Jeremy Corbyn casts his vote in Islington09:55 , Salma OuaguiraThe former Labour leader has cast his vote in Islington North where he is running against his former party.Mr Corbyn was leader of the opposition between 2015 and 2019, has represented the London constituency since 1983.The independent candidate lead the party during the last election, which saw Labour lose with only 202 seats.A Survation poll commissioned for left-wing news website Novara Media just over a week before polling day showed that he is on 29 per cent, 14 points below Labour rival Praful Nargund.Jeremy Corbyn casts his vote in Islington North where he is standing as an independent candidate (@jeremycorbyn/Twitter)Keir Starmer and wife Victoria arrive to cast their votes09:51 , Salma OuaguiraSir Keir Starmer and his wife Victoria have arrived at their constituency in Holborn, London to cast their votes.The Labour leader has all the reasons to be smiling as the polls suggest he could bag a groundbreaking majority tonight.He could enter the doors of Number 10 tomorrow as the new prime minister with an unprecedented 272-seat majority behind him, polls suggest.Sir Keir Starmer and his wife Victoria arrive to cast their votes in the 2024 General Election at Willingham Close TRA Hall in London.

In the here and now, damagingly high inflation has returned to just above the Bank of England’s target of 2%, giving the Prime Minister the opportunity to say the economy is on the right track.However, as Labour is keen to point out, the long period of unusually high inflation has long-term consequences, with lower rates simply adding less to high household costs.The state of the nation’s finances is a key element that both the main parties always claim they can be trusted on, with the Conservative Party historically regarded by voters as the more reliable on tax and spending decisions.But with most notably the turmoil caused by Liz Truss’s mini-budget in 2022, the party faces an uphill struggle to re-establish this reputation.The latest figures show the UK’s overall national debt was £2.69 trillion in April, or 97.9% of gross domestic product, and 2.5 percentage points more than at the end of April 2023.Where do all the party manifestos stand on key policy areas?08:40 , Salma OuaguiraWhere do all the party manifestos stand on key policy areas?Nigel Farage urges people to ‘vote with your heart'08:36 , Salma OuaguiraPolls are now open.

At the last general election, in December 2019, the exit poll overestimated the Conservatives’ win by three seats. It underestimated them by four seats in 2017, and by 15 seats in 2015. In 2005 and in 2010, the exit poll got the number of the leading party’s seats exactly right, first Labour and then the Conservatives, John Rentoul writes.The size of Labour’s predicted majority will be compared instantly with the historical benchmarks: Tony Blair, 179 (1997); Stanley Baldwin, 209 (1924); David Lloyd George, 239 (1918); Stanley Baldwin, 243 (1935); Ramsay MacDonald, 493 (1931).Then, there is a wait of about an hour and a half for the first declaration. At this point, the sensible thing to do would be to take a power nap – but everyone will discuss the exit poll on social media instead.The first seat to declare will this time be a race between the new Northumberland constituency of Blyth and Ashington, and Houghton and Sunderland South in Tyne and Wear. Blyth is aiming to declare around 11.30pm. It produced a significant early Conservative win in 2019, but the constituency has since been redrawn, and the new seat would have been Labour last time, so it won’t count as a Labour gain if Ian Lavery, previously the MP for Wansbeck, wins it.Sunderland South had a long run as the first seat to declare, from 1992 to 2015, but was beaten by Newcastle upon Tyne Central in 2017 and 2019. It will hope to have declared within minutes of Blyth; for its part, Newcastle upon Tyne Central now has “and West” added to it, and isn’t expected to declare until 1.15am.The main thing to look out for in the first two results is the swing from Conservative to Labour. The opinion polls currently suggest a 16 per cent swing since the last election, the equivalent of Labour up 16 points and the Tories down 16. The exit poll will provide a first estimate, but these will be the first “real votes in real ballot boxes” to test it against.

From taking selfies to telling others about how you voted, here’s everything you need to know.You must vote at the polling station to which you have been assigned between 7am and 10pm today. If you are in a queue when the polls shut, you are still allowed to vote.When you arrive, you will receive a ballot paper listing candidates and their respective parties in your constituency. You will have to take it to a screened booth where you will find a pencil to vote with. But you can use your one pen if you prefer.If you make a mistake, you can ask for another ballot paper if you have not put it in the ballot box. Votes made with a tick or even a smiley face can be counted if the choice is clear, but if counting staff cannot read the ballot, it will be disqualified.What can and can’t you do inside a polling station?The Electoral Commission advises against taking a selfie inside polling stations as it can risk accidentally giving away how someone else voted, which is against the law. But people are welcome to share pictures taken outside, even one with their dog. But you are not allowed to take pictures of the ballot paper you receive in a polling station, but you can photograph your postal ballot paper.People can tell others how they voted, but only about their choice and not anyone else’s. The fine for revealing how another person voted is up to £5,000 or six months in prison.However, people with a disability can have a presiding officer, a close family member aged 18 or over or an eligible voter to mark the paper for them. People with a visual impairment can ask for a device that allows them to mark their own ballot paper. A large print version is usually available at polling stations.Good morning and happy polling day07:02 , Salma OuaguiraAfter six weeks, the general election campaign has ended, and party leaders have made their final pitches to voters across the country. It is now the turn of the electorate to deliver the verdict.Polling stations in 650 constituencies across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland opened at 7am this morning. When the polls close in 15 hours, counting will begin straight away. At this point, The Independent will announce the results of the combined BBC, ITV and Sky News exit poll.We will then have to wait a few more hours until we find out if the predicted results are confirmed. Over the last four elections the survey has forecasted the size of the eventual majority with almost perfect accuracy.At that moment, we will get the first proper preview of how the next parliament could look like for at least the next four years.Throughout the day we will be updating seat by seat until we have a clear picture of the full results.Watch: Government expert explains how to vote even if you have lost your ID12:04 , Salma OuaguiraGovernment expert explains how to vote even if you have lost your ID"
The Telegraph,The entitled British public have been dreadful this election,[],The Telegraph,4 July 2024 at 3:44 am·2-min read,4,July,2024,03:44:00,2,"Robert Blackstock made himself famous a few days ago. Asking Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak: “Are you two really the best we’ve got?”, he got a huge round of BBC audience applause and loads of delighted smiles. Yeah, let’s all give ‘em a right good kicking.But I wonder if Mr Blackstock thinks Britain, as a whole, has covered itself in glory these last six weeks. Have we really studied the big issues? Have we looked at what matters? Are we, the voters, any better than those politicians?Take that woman who threw a milkshake at Nigel Farage. She looked terribly pleased with herself, but she’s hardly a shining example of democracy in action. And what about Question Time audience members whose contribution seems to be little more than ask: “Why am I not paid more?” And don’t get me started on that middle-aged chap in a wetsuit who keeps falling into water and bungee jumping while crying “Vote Lib Dem!”.Has there been any focus on the big stuff, like, I don’t know, war in Europe? Or our overflowing prisons? Or the humongous national debt? Or the irony that we’re about to use the ultimate expression of national democracy to elect a guy most famous for trying to overturn a referendum result? Those things matter, I’d have thought, but barely get mentioned.And while these big issues are passing us by, we’ve got ourselves tremendously exercised – or at least the ludicrously partisan BBC audiences have, along with cringey supporters at big speeches – about whether women can have penises, whether biological males can ever use women’s loos and, just this week, about whether the new prime minister should knock off at 6pm.We’ve also given loads of headspace to who’s placed a bet, whether Welsh football fans should resent being asked about the Euros and if it’s ever a good idea to announce an election in the pouring rain. Meanwhile, Rishi Sunak caused widespread excitement after being pictured on the ITV set discussing sandwiches with a near-naked woman covered in blue tattoos.Fair enough, but I suggest genocide in Ukraine and the growing danger of another widespread war on our continent should take precedence.Many of us are wallowing in a nationwide fug of indifference, more concerned with Wimbledon than Westminster. Though whether that’s the politicians’ fault or our own is open to debate. We get the politicians we deserve.I’m just glad it’s over. Tomorrow, we can reflect on what we’ve done. Far from being a source of pride, this whole election has actually been a bit of an embarrassment."
Yahoo News UK,"Will Nigel Farage's Reform UK 'beat' the Tories in the election?With some polling figures putting the Tories and Reform UK nearly neck and neck, could Farage's party really end up with nearly as many MPs as Sunak's?","['What do the latest polls say?', 'Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?', 'Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?', 'What is proportional representation?']",James Cheng-Morris and  Ellen Manning,Updated 14 June 2024 at 3:33 am·7-min read,14,June,2024,03:33:00,7,"Leading pollster John Curtice has poured cold water on suggestions that Reform UK is now beating the Conservative Party in the general election polls.As representatives from seven parties took prepared to take part in a TV debate on Thursday, a YouGov survey for The Times newspaper said Reform’s support had increased by two points to 19%, putting them ahead of the Tories for the first time.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage took the the opportunity to hail the poll results in the debate, declaring: “We are now the opposition to Labour.”But Curtice urged caution, insisting that single polls should not be relied on. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""This is one poll - we’ve actually, I think, had four other polls published in the last 24 hours - none of which have had Reform ahead, not even all of which have had Reform gaining ground, but quite a couple of them certainly suggesting it’s also got very close.""He said it may not be the case that Reform are ahead - and could be on average four or five points behind. But he said: ""This is still bad news for the Conservatives. The only way Rishi Sunak can hope to get even to base camp in narrowing the lead that Labour have started off with this campaign was to squeeze the Reform vote.""He added: ""Rather than making progress, things are actually going backwards, not least of course because of Nigel Farage’s decision to fight this campaign.""With many speculating that Reform UK with Farage at the helm could ""beat"" the Tories, Yahoo News UK takes a look.What do the latest polls say?YouGov’s voting intention tracker, updated on Tuesday, suggests the Tories and Reform UK are neck and neck.With Labour well ahead on 38%, the Tories are trailing on 18% – compared to a high of 53% under Boris Johnson in 2020 – with Reform UK just behind on 17% and the Liberal Democrats on 15%.However, there are multiple polls taking place at any one time by a number of different companies.According to the PA news agency, an average of all polls that were carried out wholly or partly during the seven days to June 13 puts Labour on 43%, 21 points ahead of the Conservatives on 22%, followed by Reform on 14%, the Lib Dems on 10% and the Greens on 6%.And while Reform’s average is up one percentage point on the figure for the previous week and the Tories are down one point, there is still an eight-point gap, on average, between the two.Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?Unless something remarkable happens, in short: 'No' - and that's because of the first past the post (FPTP) voting system in which the candidate with the largest number of votes in their constituency is elected.According to the Electoral Reform Society, which is against FPTP, this system leads to a situation where “even if millions of voters support the same party, if they are thinly spread out across the UK they may only get the largest number of votes in a couple of these contests – so only win a few MPs"".“Tens of thousands of voters supporting a different party, but who live near each other, could end up with more MPs. This means the number of MPs a party has in parliament rarely matches their popularity with the public.”Rishi Sunak on the campaign trail on Wednesday. (AFP via Getty Images)Farage knows this well. As the leader of UKIP in the 2015 election, he saw his party win 12.6% of the nationwide vote and one seat. The Liberal Democrats won 7.9% of the vote... and eight seats.Indeed, YouGov last week released a poll – put together using the multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) surveying technique, from a sample size of nearly 60,000 respondents – which suggested the Tories would win just 140 seats, having won 365 in 2019. But this is still 140 more than the zero it projected Reform UK to win, in spite of its strong polling figures.The model had Reform UK ""performing strongly in a number of seats but still a long way off winning in any"", with projected second-placed finishes in 27 constituencies.YouGov's MRP projection. (YouGov)Granted, this model was formed between 24 May and 1 June, before Farage's headline-grabbing intervention on Monday last week in which he announced he would be standing as an MP.But, even as Reform UK polls closer than ever to the Tories, it's difficult to imagine the party winning more than a handful of seats.Chris Hopkins, director at polling firm Savanta, told Yahoo News UK that in one respect, Reform UK is at an advantage compared to Ukip in 2015 because ""Ukip took votes from both Labour and the Conservatives, and we are not seeing that with Reform UK – they are all coming from the Conservatives.""That is the consequence of Rishi Sunak making immigration a centrepiece of the campaign and failing to deliver on it. Even if you have voters that are neutral on immigration, they would say the small boats policy has been a disaster.""But even so, Hopkins said, Reform UK is still ""at a huge electoral disadvantage"" in that its votes are not very concentrated, they are very evenly spread.""There are going to be some races where Reform UK is strong - the Nigel Farage factor in Clacton is really interesting - but realistically its ceiling is five seats: and that’s a high ceiling.""Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey on a campaign visit in Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire, on Wednesday. (PA)Like Reform UK, Sir Ed Davey’s Liberal Democrats are performing well in the polls.In a sign of how defensive the Tory campaign is becoming, one online party advert claims voting for Reform UK or the Lib Dems could give Labour 100 extra seats, resulting in the biggest majority in its history.It depicts a scenario where the Conservatives are beaten into third place behind the Lib Dems, with just 57 seats, despite getting 19% of the vote and without Reform winning a single seat.Read more: Pollsters got it wrong in 2015, so could Labour’s lead be overestimated? (The Guardian)However, it remains unlikely the Lib Dems will finish second. YouGov’s MRP poll projected the party performing strongly, winning 48 seats. This would be up 37 from 2019, but still nowhere near the Tories’ projected 140.However, amid all this talk about projections, it’s worth remembering they are still only polls and not a definite indicator of how people will vote on 4 July. The 1992 and 2015 elections are notable examples of how polling didn’t match the end results of Tory wins.What is proportional representation?Proportional representation, as defined by the UK parliament, is an electoral system ""in which the distribution of seats corresponds closely with the proportion of the total votes cast for each party. For example, if a party gained 40% of the total votes, a perfectly proportional system would allow them to gain 40% of the seats.""This differs from the first past the post system, as set out above, in that a relatively high vote share rarely corresponds with increased seats for the smaller parties. In 2019, for example, the Lib Dems won 11.5% of the vote but only 1.7% – 11 – of the 650 seats.Unsurprisingly, both Reform UK and the Lib Dems support proportional representation.The Lib Dems this week made it part of their manifesto, with the party saying it would introduce the single transferrable vote method, a form of proportional representation which allows electors to rank their preference of candidates on the ballot.The party previously sought to change the UK’s voting system while in the coalition government under then-leader Nick Clegg, but voters rejected the plan in a 2011 referendum.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

The Conservatives go into election day having lost more than half of their support, and polling more than 10 points below their worst ever previous result. No wonder that polls project a record swing to Labour, larger, by far, than in any previous postwar election.Some projections have the Tories falling below 100 seats – an extinction-level event for Britain’s oldest and most electorally successful party. Thursday looks set to be a night of historic political drama: here are the key things to look out for as the night goes on.Interactive1 The exit poll and the early running: were the polls right? Is the exit poll right?The show begins at 10pm, when the polls close and the exit poll is published. This will give us a first sense of the scale of what is to come. If late swing or polling error is going to deliver a surprise, the exit poll is when we will first see it.Discussion of exit poll projections will dominate the early hours as politicians and pundits await the first results, and some will be sure to cast doubt as to accuracy. Ignore them. While no method is perfect, the exit poll has an excellent recent track record and can be trusted to chart the broad contours of the night to come.InteractiveThe next big moments will come about midnight, when the first seats declare. The very first is likely to be in Sunderland, which has made fast counts a speciality in recent contests. The key things to watch for is how the swing and result compare to exit poll projections, and how Reform UK is doing. Cramlington and Killingworth, another early reporting north-east seat, is worth watching, as its predecessor, Blyth Valley, was the first “red wall” seat taken by the Tories in 2019, and will be the first brick in a rebuilt red wall for Labour this time.With polling suggesting weaker swings to Labour in the seats it already holds, the best early indicators will come from the trio of early-declaring Conservative seats. Swindon South is a classic swing seat, which Labour should take easily. Two others, Broxbourne, and Basildon and Billericay, provide sterner tests – each requires a swing of more than 20 points to take, substantially above the current polling averages. Losing either or both of these seats will be a ­bitter early blow for Conservatives and may be an early sign of a Labour landslide to come.2 Red wall restoration? Will Labour recover seats lost to the Conservatives since 2015?The fall of the red wall was a ­bitter blow for Labour in 2019, as seat after seat turned against the party they had backed for generations. Recovering the lost heartlands is not just a matter of sentiment – Labour cannot win a majority without a rebuilt red wall.The early-to-declare red-wall seats are all near-certain to be Labour gains. But watch to see how high the majorities go when Leigh and Atherton, and then Darlington, declare earlier – this will give some hint about the scale of Labour’s recovery.Recovering Bolsover, the seat for nearly 50 years of leftwing firebrand Dennis Skinner, will be a particular morale boost for Labour leftwingers. But it will be victories in Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes, and in Scunthorpe, that will suggest Labour is on course to fully sweep the red wall, as these are seats where the Conservatives have larger notional majorities to defend. A win later in Bassetlaw would be the icing on the cake, meaning Labour had recovered the seat that saw the largest swing against them in 2019.The conclusion of the red wall story will come in Spen Valley after dawn. A win for Labour candidate Kim Leadbeater here will bring Keir Starmer’s recovery story full circle. It was Leadbeater’s narrow victory in the Batley and Spen byelection that steadied the Starmer ship in summer 2021, after a bruising set of local and byelection defeats had called his leadership into question. Now a second victory for Leadbeater in Spen Valley could help to complete the leader’s remarkable Labour comeback.3 Tartan tides: Will Scotland fall to Labour too?One of the underdiscussed subplots of this election is the huge SNP-to-Labour swing in Scottish polling. This is as large as the swing south of the border and, with the SNP vote evenly spread, dozens of SNP seats are now on a knife-edge. Hamilton and Clyde Valley, which should declare before 2am, provides the first real test. Labour needs an eight-point swing and could be in for a disappointing night in Scotland if they fall short. A Labour win in East Kilbride and Strathaven, where they need a 13-point swing, will suggest big gains to come, while a win in Dundee Central, reporting after 2am, would suggest a Scottish earthquake is coming – this is the SNP’s safest seat.InteractiveTwo Scottish subplots will develop later on. The first is the fate of seats contested between the Conservatives and the SNP. With both parties declining, but their opponents often weak and fragmented, these are hard seats to call. Some may end up as three-way or even four-way marginals, and surprise wins from third or even fourth place can’t be ruled out. The Lib Dems provide the other Scottish subplot. They are only in direct contention in a handful of Scottish seats, but have deep roots in parts of Scotland and would also dearly like to avenge the 2019 defeat of Jo Swinson by recovering Mid Dunbartonshire, the successor to the former leader’s East Dunbartonshire seat.4 Will the blue wall fall to the Lib Dems?This election is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the Liberal Democrats. Political geography, long their worst enemy, is finally working in their favour, as they start in second place to a flailing government in dozens of seats. They stand also to benefit from a helpful Labour party with an unthreatening leader, which should make it easier to maximise tactical voting and to win over Tory moderates voters spooked by Corbyn but now reassured by Starmer.InteractiveThe first signs of Lib Dem ­progress will come about 2am, when two seats at opposite ends of England, Harrogate and Knaresborough, and Torbay, report. Both had Lib Dem MPs during the New Labour years, and the Lib Dems will hope to recover both this week. Torbay – Brexity and bluer – is the tougher task.We will learn if we are in for a more dramatic Lib Dem breakthrough after about 3am, when seats such as Stratford-on-Avon, Epsom and Ewell, and Witney report their results. These heartland seats have all reliably returned Tory MPs for a century or more – and all require big swings. Victory for the Lib Dems in David Cameron’s former seat of Witney would be a potent symbol of a possible revolt by home counties Tory stalwarts against the populist, Brexit-flavoured Conservatism of Cameron’s successors.5 The Farage effect: where could Reform win outright and where will they tip the balance against the Tories?The return of Nigel Farage has upended this campaign, with a Reform UK bounce further damaging grim Tory prospects. Yet Reform’s support is too evenly spread, and the party’s organisation too weak, for Farage to gain many seats outright. Reform’s biggest impact will instead come through tipping the balance against the Conservatives in hundreds of seats.We can see this by looking at how many seats Labour alone gains at different levels of swing and different levels of Conservative-to-Reform switching. At each level of swing, Labour can make 100 or more extra seat gains if we move from a low to high rate of Conservative-to-Reform switching.InteractiveThe scale of the defeat will depend heavily on the share of Conservative voters who end up in the Reform column. Castle Point will give an early indication – the Conservatives start with a huge majority here, but Ukip topped 30% in this heavily leave-voting seat. If either Reform or Labour wins here, it will ­suggest a Reform surge and a Tory slump are coming in heavily leave-voting areas. Mansfield, Norfolk North and Great Yarmouth will provide three tests of the Reform effect. Strong Reform performances could help Labour win Mansfield and the Lib Dems win Norfolk North, and turn Great Yarmouth into a three-way marginal.Reform won’t win many seats but could win a few. Clacton is the likeliest gain, with polling suggesting Nigel Farage will finally win a Commons seat at the eighth attempt. Boston and Skegness, where Farage’s predecessor, Richard Tice, is standing, is another prospect, as is Ashfield, where Tory-to-Reform defector Lee Anderson faces a chaotic local dogfight with Labour and the popular independent council leader Jason Zadrozny. It is also worth watching how Reform do in Barnsley – the only place where the Brexit party came second in 2019.6 Red and blue breakthroughs for the Greens?While Reform will be the smaller party making the biggest waves in this contest, advances for the Greens could be a sign of disruptions to come. The Greens are targeting four seats. They are looking to hold off a Labour challenge in Brighton Pavilion, where the first Green MP, Caroline Lucas, is standing down, and defeat Labour in Bristol Central, where Green co-leader Carla Denyer is running against Labour shadow cabinet minister Thangam Debbonaire. The Greens are also targeting two deep-blue rural seats – Waveney Valley and North Herefordshire. Both constituency polls and MRP models suggest they are in with a strong chance in all four contests.The Greens will also hope to build a platform for future success with strong second places in other seats where local support is strong. Keep an eye on results in the Isle of Wight, Sheffield and in central London and Manchester seats. None are likely to fall to the Greens, but second-place finishes could set them up as contenders in contests to come.7 Trouble in Labour’s backyard?Keir Starmer faces some tricky defences in Labour’s backyard, particularly in seats with large Muslim electorates or high-profile independents. George Galloway mobilised unrest over the Gaza conflict among Muslim voters to take Rochdale from Labour in a byelection earlier this spring. Labour will dearly hope to retake the seat from Galloway in the rematch. Labour is also fighting off challenges from Galloway’s Workers Party of Britain and Galloway-aligned independents in seats with large Muslim communities such as Birmingham Ladywood, where Akhmed Yakoob hopes to unseat Labour shadow cabinet minister Shabana Mahmood.Then there is the messy contest in Leicester East, the seat with the largest Hindu electorate in Britain. Two former Labour MPs, Keith Vaz and Claudia Webbe, are standing against their former party, while Labour also faces a threat from resurgent local Conservatives, who made major gains in Leicester in 2023 local elections. This seat, along with two outer London seats – Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner and Harrow East – are worth watching to see if Rishi Sunak’s rise as the first ever Hindu prime minister has accelerated a long-term drift towards the Conservatives among Hindu voters.Finally, in Islington North, Labour faces a unique challenge, when Keir Starmer’s predecessor as Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, challenges his former party in the seat he represented for more than 40 years, mostly as a Labour MP.8 Return of New Labour? Seats Blair won in 1997 that Starmer could win backTo what extent will Starmer’s win be a restoration of the 1997 Blair ascendancy? There are 199 seats which Blair would have won on current boundaries in 1997 and which Labour does not currently hold. If polling proves accurate, Starmer could regain 150 or more of these lost New Labour seats.InteractiveThe first big test of Starmer’s recovery in middle England will come when Swindon North reports before 2am. The seat backed Blair three times and has swung heavily to the Tories since. Labour needs a 14-point swing to recover it.Cannock Chase provides an even bigger test. This Staffordshire seat has proved to be one of the swingiest in the country, going from a 55% Labour vote in 1997 to a near 70% Conservative vote in 2019. If Labour wins here, it will suggest Keir Starmer has won back the hearts of middle England – or is at least benefiting from a total Tory rejection in Blair’s old heartlands.Keep an eye out later in the night for results from classic suburban and small town bellwethers such as Crawley, Romford, Dudley and Nuneaton. Blair won them all and if Starmer is going on to match his predecessor, so should he. Tamworth, which Labour lost after Blair and won back on a huge swing in a recent byelection, is another seat to watch.9 Bigger than Blair? Seats Starmer could win which never backed New LabourWith Keir Starmer projected to achieve the largest swing in postwar history, Labour can set their sights higher than even the landslide victory of 1997, targeting seats which Blair never won but which demographic change, and exceptional polling, make winnable next week.The first signs that Starmer may be advancing into uncharted territory will come between 2am and 3am, when North West Cambridgeshire and Aldershot declare. Neither has ever elected a Labour MP, and both require very large swings, but most MRP models now favour the opposition in both. Labour could also take the once true-blue seats of Blair-era Tory big beasts, including Ken Clarke’s Rushcliffe and John Major’s Huntingdon.InteractiveIf Labour also manages to hold Mid Bedfordshire, which they took on a massive swing in a byelection, and gain places such as Isle of Wight West or Bexhill and Battle, which have never returned Labour MPs before, then we will probably be on course for a “bigger than Blair” majority as the Conservative retreat turns into a rout.10 ‘A new dawn has ­broken, has it not?’ How low could the Tories go?The broad outlines of the electoral landscape will be clear well before dawn. While the scale and scope of a probable Labour victory settled, two questions will remain: how many Conservatives will survive? And who will be the “big beasts” of the outgoing government whose defeat will provide the “Portillo moments” of this election night?If the swings in this election become very large, the fate of many Conservative MPs may turn on the ability of voters in very safe Tory seats to coalesce behind a single opponent in seats where the tactical voting signals are not clear.A total Tory wipeout becomes plausible if Liberal Democrats can perform as well as Labour at very high levels of overall swing. But if – as is perhaps more likely – tactical voting rates are weaker in very safe Tory seats with split opposition, then dozens of Conservatives may survive even if their party’s national vote collapses.InteractivePortillo moments won’t be hard to find next week. With a historically unprecedented swing expected, the list of high-profile MPs at risk is long. Defeat looks all but certain for former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith and self-styled Brexit hardman Steve Baker, while losses for serial cabinet minister and leadership hopeful Grant Shapps or chancellor Jeremy Hunt will not come as a surprise – most pollsters project them to lose.The true Portillo moment combines shock and gravity – a big beast felled unexpectedly in a seat thought to be safe, sending shockwaves through the party ranks. The loss of Hunt, a serving chancellor, would be a bitter blow but not a surprising one. Losses for Robert Jenrick (Newark) or Penny Mordaunt (Portsmouth North) would be more consequential, reshaping the leadership contest to come. Defeat for polarising GB News favourites such as Jacob Rees-Mogg (North East Somerset and Hanham) and Esther McVey (Tatton) will dismay the right and delight the left.With unprecedented swings on the cards, there is even an outside chance that this election count could deliver the ultimate Portillo moment – the defeat of a current or former prime minister. Both Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have daunting majorities, but Sunak has felt vulnerable enough to send activists to his own seat, while the ever-unpopular Truss could underperform her own party if angry local voters mobilise against her. Sunak’s seat is due to report first. If he manages to survive, then it may perhaps fall to Truss to symbolise the Conservatives’ election night with the same quality that defined her premiership: spectacular and unprecedented political failure.Robert Ford is professor of political science at Manchester University and co-author of The British General Election of 2019"

Many also assume his title is hereditary.Here's what you need to know about the personal life of the man who wants to be the UK’s next prime minister.His early lifeStarmer was born in Southwark, south London, in 1962, as the second of four children. His parents were Labour Party members and named him after Keir Hardie, the party’s first leader in parliament.The family moved out of the capital and he grew up in Hurst Green, a village just outside the small Surrey town of Oxted. He was active in youth politics from his teenage years but was also a skilled musician, taking music lessons alongside Norman Cook, who later became better known as a member of The Housemartins and the DJ Fatboy Slim.Starmer played the flute, piano, violin and recorder and was a junior exhibitioner at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.His familyStarmer with his wife, Lady Victoria Starmer, at the Labour Party Conference in October 2023. (Alamy)Starmer is married to Victoria, a former solicitor who later retrained in occupational health and now works for the NHS. The pair met through their work in the law in the early 2000s and married in Essex in 2007.She was first seen accompanying her husband when the couple were filmed clapping for carers during the pandemic in 2020 outside their home in Camden. They have two children, a son and daughter, but both are kept out of the public eye.Victoria's father was Jewish and originally came from Poland, while her mother converted when they got married. Starmer has said in a previous interview that ""my wife in particular wants our children to know the faith of her family"" and that they ""observe some of the practices, for example Friday night prayers"".His parentsKeir Starmer with parents, Rodney and Josephine, at his graduation. (Twitter/Keir Starmer)The Labour leader's father, Rodney Starmer, worked as a toolmaker in a factory, and his mother Josephine Starmer (née Baker), was a nurse.His father worked 14-hour days but spent his time outside work caring for Josephine, who was diagnosed with the autoimmune condition Still’s disease. She required two hip and knee replacements twice in her lifetime and struggled with arthritic pain.As a young man Starmer also helped care for his mother, which he has said led to him being more emotionally reserved. His sister, Katy, recalled: “He’s had to be a grown-up all his life. I’ve always been quite open about my feelings – Keir is good at most things, but not that.” Josephine Starmer died in 2015, and his father three years later.His educationA photograph of a younger Starmer as shown on ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories in 2021. (ITV)Starmer passed the 11-plus examination, and attended Reigate Grammar School from age 11. While he was at the school it became an independent fee-paying institution, but as an existing student he was exempt from fees, and his tuition in the sixth form was covered by a bursary.After school he studied law at the University of Leeds, this first in his family to attend university, graduating with a first class degree in 1985. He undertook postgraduate law studied at the University of Oxford, where he served as editor of a radical magazine, Socialist Alternatives.Why is he a Sir?Keir Starmer pictured in 2010, when he was director of public prosecutions, making a statement about MPs who face charges over their expenses claims. (Getty)Starmer was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 2014 in recognition of his work in the legal profession, culminating in a five-year term as director of public prosecutions (DPP).He first became a barrister in 1987 at the Middle Temple, later joining Doughty Street Chambers and was appointed a Queen’s counsel in 2002, aged just 39. In 2008 he was appointed head of the Crown Prosecution Service and DPP.During his tenure he chose to prosecute three Labour MPs and a Conservative in the wake of the parliamentary expenses scandal, and was responsible for prosecuting former MP Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce for perverting the course of justice after Pryce claimed responsibility for her former husband’s speeding offence."
Yahoo News UK,"Who is Rishi Sunak? PM battles to stay in power after election gambleAs the prime minister calls a snap election, here’s everything you need to know about Rishi Sunak","['Early life', ""Sunak's family"", 'His parents', 'His education', 'How much is he worth?', 'His religion']",Hannah Fearn,Updated 4 July 2024 at 1:35 am·4-min read,4,July,2024,01:35:00,4,"Rishi Sunak enjoyed an astonishingly rapid ascent through the Tory party to become prime minister in 2022.A multimillionaire former hedge fund manager with an MBA from Stanford University in California and married to the daughter of one India’s richest men, he has however found it hard to shed the perception he is remote from the concerns of ordinary Britons.Early lifeSunak was born in Southampton in 1980, the eldest of three children. His Indian parents both arrived from East Africa in the 1960s. A football-mad boy whose childhood idol was Matt Le Tissier, Sunak was described by the family’s neighbours as a child with “lovely manners”.In his youngest years, the PM attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. According to a recent biography, fellow pupil Ollie Case said: “He was someone that was talked about. The teachers would say: ‘He’s going to be prime minister'.""But, growing up in the 1980s and 90s, he also remembers experiencing racism. “My mother was obsessed with us not having accents,” Sunak has said.Rishi Sunak was football-mad as a boy growing up in Southampton. (ITV)Sunak's familySunak is married to Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian entrepreneur and multi-billionaire. The pair first met in 2004 at Stanford University, his future wife apparently attracted to his “honesty and integrity”.Five years later they married in a two-day Indian wedding held in Bangalore. The couple have two daughters, Krishna and Anoushka, who will turn 13 and 11 this year, both of whom are largely kept out of the public eye.Sunak attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. (Rishi Sunak, Instagram)His parentsYashvir Sunak, Rishi’s father, was born in Kenya. He arrived in the UK to study medicine and then stayed, becoming an NHS GP. His mother, Usha, was born in Tanzania and is a pharmacist.The couple met in Britain and settled in Southampton in the 1970s. Usha is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.His educationAs a teenager Sunak studied at Winchester College where he was, he says, a self-confessed “geek”. According to a recent biography, the “naughtiest” thing the prime minister did during his school days “was to smuggle a hand-held television into the school so that he did not miss any key games of Euro 96”.The childhood home of Rishi Sunak in Southampton. (Getty Images, photo taken in 2022)Perhaps unsurprisingly for someone with such an unblemished record, he went on to become the school’s head boy. Sunak worked while studying, delivering medicines for his mother’s pharmacy and as a waiter at a local Indian restaurant.After school, Sunk read philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, graduating in 2001 with a first class degree. While still at university he held an internship at the Conservative Party campaign headquarters and joined the party, but went on studying before entering politics.He earned his MBA from Stanford in 2006 as a Fulbright Scholar, meaning he was selected among the most promising candidates from the UK.How much is he worth?Rishi Sunak's mother is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.As prime minister, Rishi Sunak earns £80,807 on top of a salary of £84,144 for being an MP. But his current income from Westminster pales in comparison to his family’s vast wealth through marriage.The Sunday Times valued the couple’s joint fortune at £730m. Murty's father is the co-founder of Infosys, an Indian tech conglomerate, in which she holds shares estimated at around £430m. Her family is also involved in a £900m business arrangement with Amazon in India, and she is a shareholder of multiple other companies.Before entering politics Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and a series of hedge funds. He is also known to have invested in blind trusts, in which investments are made without holders knowing where the funds are located. These arrangements reportedly hold Sunak’s own multi-million-pound fortune.Sunak, his wife Akshata and daughters Anoushka and Krishna (second left) at Santa Monica Pier, California, on their summer holiday in 2023. (AP)His religionSunak is not only the first prime minister of colour and of Indian heritage but he is also the first practising Hindu to hold the biggest job in UK politics.He has spoken of his pride in his Hindu faith, saying, “that’s how I was raised, and that’s how I am”. He said: “Having faith gives you resilience, gives you strength that is important and it provides an outlook on life which I find particularly valuable.”"
Yahoo News UK,"Who is Richard Tice? Reform’s former leader turned Farage sidekickThe candidate for Hartlepool has seen his party's popularity swell in recent months, with one poll showing reform ahead of the Conservatives.",[],Andrew Naughtie,Updated 14 June 2024 at 3:45 am·6-min read,14,June,2024,03:45:00,6,"Now that Nigel Farage has taken over as the leader of Reform UK, Richard Tice’s public profile is fading fast - but the Reform chairman remains involved in the party's operations.So far, the party has only one MP, Conservative defector Lee Anderson. But a recent poll has shown Reform overtaking the Tories, raising the possibility Anderson could hold his seat and even end up with fellow Reformers in the next Parliament.As the candidate for Hartlepool, where he stood as the Brexit Party candidate in 2019, Tice hopes to be one of them. So who is he, and what does he stand for?Childhood and educationBorn in Surrey in 1964 to James Tice, a showjumper, and Joan Tice, a horse trainer. Educated at the private boarding school Uppingham, he studied at the University of Salford, gaining a degree in construction economics and quantity surveying – teeing him up for a career that he said would ""continue the family genes in the property industry"".Family (partner & kids)Tice has three children from a 24-year marriage that ended in divorce. He is now in a long-term relationship with the right-wing writer and journalist Isabel Oakeshott.She is perhaps best known for two notorious incidents that set her against leading Tories: a book that featured the heavily disputed allegation that David Cameron had engaged in sexual activity with a pig, and the release of embarrassing messages entrusted to her by Matt Hancock when she agreed to write a book with him.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election? Full list mappedThe key issues that will decide the electionWhen is the first UK general election TV debate?What is purdah? The strict rule that governs what politicians can and can't sayNet worthWhile not quite in the same league as Rishi Sunak, Tice is one of the wealthiest people in British politics. As he describes it on his website, he made his multi-million-pound fortune over the course of “30 years of making things happen in property investment”, starting with a graduate job at a London firm in 1987.According to Tice, the company he leads as CEO, Quidnet Capital, has “bought and managed £500 million in commercial properties across the UK on behalf of clients”.He was also a key figure in the redevelopment of London’s Nine Elms district, near Battersea Power Station, a controversial project that has transformed a stretch of the Thames’s south bank with a welter of rapidly erected high-rise blocks.GB News linksAlong with Nigel Farage, Lee Anderson and several MPs on the right flank of the Tory party, Tice is a regular on the hard-right, culture war-focused TV outlet GB News. There he hosts a programme called “Richard Tice’s Sunday Sermon”, which serves as a platform for him to deliver his political analysis without the interruptions of an interviewer.However, despite the network being a relatively safe space for him in ideological terms, Tice’s appearances aren’t always amicable. A recent interview with host Andrew Pierce, a longtime right-wing commentator, saw him challenged fiercely about Reform’s chances in a summer election should one be called – with Pierce pointing to the “weirdos” selected by the party to fight numerous seats as evidence the party is “not ready”.Richard Tice, pictured in 2018 at a 'Leave Means Leave' campaign event, is focused on the issue of immigration. (Steve Finn/WENN)Tice was also involved in an incident that saw the network deemed in breach of broadcasting regulator Ofcom’s impartiality regulations, specifically an interview in which a former Brexit Party MEP failed to “sufficiently challenge” his views on immigration.The regulator is under increasing pressure to crack down on GB News heading into the election, with critics arguing it cannot be allowed to broadcast shows that feature Tory and Reform MPs interviewing each other without alternative points of view represented.Tice on NHSThe state and future of the NHS set to be one of this election’s main battlegrounds, and Reform’s key health policy is to spend £17 billion on the NHS on top of its current budget in an effort to get waiting lists down to zero. It also proposes introducing tax relief on private healthcare – something that has been criticised by opponents as a creeping step towards the privatisation of healthcare writ large.Tice’s stated rationale is that the reason the service is struggling is because the money it needs is being spent on other things that the public do not in fact support. Top of the list is Net Zero, which the party and its predecessors have long decried as a pointless “woke” project.In April, Tice used a press conference to frame the choice starkly. “We have a choice in this country, it seems to me,” he said. “A pretty clear choice. Do we want zero waiting lists in two years, and to keep them there? That is the Reform choice. Or do we want net zero CO2 emissions in 25 years? That is the Labour choice.”Tice on immigrationImmigration is by far Reform UK’s top issue, with the party looking to build on Farage’s two decades of campaigning against it in its legal and illegal forms.As far as the election goes, Tice and the party are targeting the continuing arrival of small boats of people travelling across the English Channel, many of them seeking asylum. He has criticised the government for failing to stop “mass immigration” post-Brexit, and described Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda policy as “a disaster”, arguing on GB News that its supposed deterrent value was revealed to be zero just hours after the House of Commons finally passed the law.Reform chairman Richard Tice (L) and leader Nigel Farage speak at the party's economic policy launch at Church House in London. (Alamy Live News)“Within a matter of hours more boats, absolutely packed full, overfilled with illegal migrants, were setting off from the beaches. And we learnt on Tuesday morning that sadly five people, including a young child, drowned leaving the beaches. That's not a deterrent. That's an absolute disaster.”Instead of deporting people to Rwanda, he is arguing for a “pick up and take back” policy that would see small boat arrivals deposited back on French soil. As evidence that this is both practical and humane, he has cited similar policies deployed in the US and Australia.However, he has not addressed the fact that Australia’s policy has been criticised internationally for leaving so-called “boat people” confined to facilities on the island of Nauru, where there have been incidents of suicide and self-immolation.Tice on cost of living crisisPerhaps unsurprisingly given he is trying to peel away former Tory voters, Tice has criticised recent Tory prime ministers harshly for overseeing Britain’s intense cost of living crisis. In 2022, he accused then-prime minister Boris Johnson of “waffling” over the situation. “Clueless, out of touch, no ideas, no help,” he tweeted. “Shocking.”He has also warned that the prospect of a “disastrous” Labour government will offer no prospect of meaningful relief for struggling households.Instead, Reform proposes lifting the minimum level of income tax to £20,000 while cutting various other taxes – among them fuel duty, another gesture to the party’s rejection of environmentalism as a top priority."
