The Telegraph,"Sunak to lose seat in Tory wipeout, major poll predicts",[],Ben Riley-Smith,19 June 2024 at 8:38 am·5-min read,19,June,2024,08:38:00,5,"Rishi Sunak is predicted to become the first sitting prime minister ever to lose their seat at a general election.The Conservatives are also on track to slump to just 53 seats, with around three-quarters of the Cabinet voted out, a major opinion poll for The Telegraph has revealed.The Liberal Democrats are on course to be just behind the Tories on 50 MPs, according to the Savanta and Electoral Calculus polling analysis, leaving them in touching distance of becoming the official opposition.Labour is forecast to have 516 seats and an estimated House of Commons majority of 382 - double that won by Sir Tony Blair in 1997 - as Sir Keir Starmer becomes prime minister.Meanwhile Reform, despite a surge in the polls, is predicted to get zero seats. For Nigel Farage, the recently returned Reform leader, it would mean an eighth defeat as a parliamentary candidate in a row.The SNP, according to the poll, are predicted to slump to just eight MPs, down from 48 in 2019, with Labour once again the dominant party of Scotland as they were under Sir Tony.The polling suggests Tory warnings of a Labour “super-majority” are accurate. It also lays bare the scale of voter disillusionment with the Tories and suggests an uncertain road for the party in the years ahead.Other polling analyses in recent weeks have had the Tories slumping markedly, sometimes below 100 seats. But none have had them performing quite this badly.This is the first poll of its kind to forecast Labour to win more than 500 seats. No other poll has predicted the Tories would win so few seats.The polling from Savanta for The Telegraph consulted around 18,000 people between June 7 and June 18, capturing views throughout the last fortnight of the election campaign.The analysis comes from a method called Multilevel Regression and Post-stratification, or MRP, which allows pollsters to take survey results and predict results in individual seats.In simple terms, it involves talking to many more people than a typical poll - around ten times more - and drilling down into the demographic details of both respondents and constituencies.More than a hundred seats are predicted to be won by such narrow margins that the pollster believes they remain up for grabs.A small improvement in the Tory vote share could have a marked impact on their seat total.But the results, published with just a fortnight left before the general election, make clear that the Tories are facing a defeat of historic proportions from a frustrated electorate.Other MRP polling analyses in recent weeks have had the Tories slumping markedly, sometimes below 100 seats. But none have had them performing quite this badly.The explanation, according to Savanta, comes in the lead that Labour was found to have had over Conservatives, which was 21 percentage points - a little higher than other recent MRP polls.Savanta’s estimated voting intention has Labour on 44 per cent, the Conservatives on 23 per cent, Reform on 13 per cent, the Lib Dems on 12 per cent, the Greens on 4 per cent, the SNP on 3 per cent and Plaid Cymru on 1 per cent.The Tories falling so low in nationwide vote share means that not only are they predicted to lose scores of seats to Labour, but also lose out to the Lib Dems in a host of others.Securing 53 MPs would comfortably be the Conservatives’ worst result in modern history. It would be less than a third of the 165 MPs they got in 1997 when Sir Tony’s New Labour swept to power.It would also amount to a remarkable slump from 2019, when under Boris Johnson the Tories secured 365 MPs. It would mean the Tories keeping just 13 per cent of their 2019 seats.Mr Sunak is predicted to lose his Richmond seat to Labour, though this race is among those which Savanta says is still in the balance given the close margins.If that were to happen, it would be a moment of history. No prime minister has ever lost their seat at a general election, according to the Institute for Government.Arthur Balfour is the only prime minister to have come close to losing their seat. He resigned as prime minister in December 1905 and was officially the opposition leader when he lost his seat in the election at the start of 1906.The predicted result would also have a major impact on who could follow Mr Sunak as Tory leader, given many of those tipped to run next month if there is a defeat are predicted to lose their seats.Penny Mordaunt, the Commons Leader, Grant Shapps, the Defence Secretary, Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, and Robert Jenrick, the former migration minister, all lose their seats on this prediction.So too do Jeremy Hunt, the Chancellor, and James Cleverly, the Home Secretary, meaning that three of the four great offices of state holders would be swept out. The fourth, Lord Cameron, the Foreign Secretary, is not an MP.Reform, according to the Savanta polling analysis, would not win any seats, though given the rapid recent changes in the party’s profile, an extra element of doubt could apply to them.Mr Farage only became Reform leader a few days before this polling began, with an uptick in its vote being seen throughout the last fortnight. His impact on the seat of Clacton, where he is standing, is also hard to predict with nationwide polling.Reform’s polling increase means only recently has Savanta started putting it among the list of political parties offered up front as an option to respondents, rather than only after the select “other”.Plaid Cymru would be on four seats. The Greens would get zero seats. Seat projections are not made for Northern Ireland, given polling challenges because of party differences there.The general election is now just 15 days away."
The Independent,"Sunak’s Titanic, photobombs and upside down flags: The best general election gaffes so far","['Rishi Sunak and the Conservative Party', 'Keir Starmer and the Labour Party', 'Ed Davey and the Liberal Democrats']",Jabed Ahmed,19 June 2024 at 8:07 am·9-min read,19,June,2024,08:07:00,9,"The general election campaign is in full swing with party leaders travelling across the country announcing policies and speaking to voters. Over last month, there has been no shortage of gaffes and blunders, particularly from prime minister Rishi Sunak.From being soaked outside Number 10 as he called the snap election without an umbrella, to being asked if he was captaining a “sinking ship” when he visited Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the PM’s campaign has been far from ideal.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has also had his fair share of blunders. He has been spotted falling off a paddleboard, riding a waterslide in a rubber ring and skidding down a hill on a bike – all as part of his campaign trail.With 15 days until voters head to the polls, party communications teams will be hoping to avoid any more slip ups.The Independent has put together the best gaffes and blunders from the election campaign below.Rishi Sunak and the Conservative Party‘Things can only get wetter’: Sunak drenched as he announces electionThe campaign hadn’t even begun when the prime minister made his first mistake – swapping the £2.6 million Downing Street press briefing room for the Great British Outdoors.Heavy rain poured down on the prime minister, who spoke from a lectern outside No 10 without an umbrella.Labour’s 1997 theme Things Can Only Get Better by D:Ream was blasted from a speaker, drowning out Mr Sunak’s attempts to boast of his inflation achievements.Mr Sunak, wearing a suit with a light blue tie, became increasingly soaked during the speech.A few days later, the PM admitted he “was a bit wet” during the announcement.Own goal at Welsh brewery over national team’s Euros absenceOne day into the election trail, Mr Sunak asked staff at a brewery in Barry, South Wales,  if they were looking forward to this summer’s football, despite the national team not qualifiying for the Euros.But one of the pub workers was quick to correct him on his mishap, following Wales’s play-off final defeat to Poland in March.He interjected and said “Only if you support England!”, to which Mr Sunak awkwardly replied the hospitality industry was one the Conservatives supported.Captain of a “sinking ship” at the Titanic QuarterRishi Sunak wears a life jacket during his visit to the Titanic Quarter (Stefan Rousseau/PA Wire)The prime minister faced another blunder when asked by a reporter whether he was captaining a ""sinking ship"" during a visit to Northern Ireland's Titanic Quarter.The unfortunate question was asked when Mr Sunak visited Artemis Technologies, a local company which manufactures zero-emissions maritime technology with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Chris Heaton-Harris.“Are you captaining a sinking ship going into this election?” the reporter asked.To which an irked Sunak replied: “If you look at what’s happened over the past few weeks, you can see our plan is working.”Mr Heaton-Harris, who was standing right next to the PM, could be seen struggling to contain his grin.Questioned by a Tory councillor(Stefan Rousseau/PA Wire)In one of the first Q&A events at a distribution centre in Derbyshire, the PM took questions from supposedly random workers.Speaking to around 50 people, he was asked about his flagship plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda.He was told that the “biggest issue is going to be immigration over this election campaign” before he was asked whether “your Rwanda plan is going to see results and stop the small boats coming?”Broadcasters showed Prime Minister thanking the man for his “important question.”It later emerged the question had come from Conservative Leicestershire County councillor Ross Hills.Sunak stands below an exit sign(via REUTERS)On a flight to a campaign event two days into the election campaign, Mr Sunak suffered an unfortunate blunder when he was snapped standing underneath an exit sign.‘Blank page’ Labour attack backfiresThe Labour Party turned an attempt by Mr Sunak to mock them into a viral post that looks like he is endorsing them. The Tories’ latest post on TikTok shows the prime minister explaining “Labour’s policy for our country’s future” on a flipchart.The short video sees him turn over the cover to show a blank page, before capping a pen in his hand, placing it down and walking off-camera.But Labour’s social media team were quick to hit back at the video with an edited version that showed Sir Keir Starmer’s “first steps for change” on the flipchart.The Labour Party post has now received over 2.4 million views on X and a further 308,000 on TikTok.Union Jack flag flying upside downIn the Conservative Party’s first election broadcast, the Union Jack depicted flying upside down.The prime minister’s video pointed to uncertain times fuelled by “pandemic, war in Europe and the Middle East, a reckless dictator in Russia… China”.“We face unprecedented challenges here at home because of global insecurity, but by sticking with the plan Rishi Sunak is steadying the ship and making progress,” a deep-voiced narrator says over footage of the PM working.But, just minutes after the video was released, it was pointed out that perhaps the most striking part of the video is a shot of the UK’s flag upside down.Sunak photobombed by Lib Dems boatThe prime minister was photobombed by Liberal Democrats campaigners on a boat as he spoke to rowers in Oxfordshire on Monday.The prime minister was visiting a riverside rowing club as Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper and a group of activists rode past on the water holding orange diamond-shaped voting placards. Campaigners could be seen waving at the PM.Of the stunt, a Lib Dem source told media: “This is just another small boat Rishi Sunak can’t deal with.”Flock of sheep flee as Rishi Sunak and David Cameron try to feed themA flock of sheep fled as Rishi Sunak and David Cameron tried to feed them during a campaign visit to Devon on 18 June.The prime minister and Lord Cameron entered the sheep’s pen with buckets full of food for the animals.“Come on,” Mr Sunak said as the flock ran to the other side of the pen.“They don’t want to play ball,” a farmer accompanying Mr Sunak said.Grant Shapps hangs up phone live on TV when asked about losing his seatDefence secretary Grant Shapps hung up the phone during a live interview when he was asked about losing his seat in the upcoming general election.A YouGov survey suggested the defence secretary could be voted out of parliament along with many of his Conservative colleagues.While presenting the polls’ results on Sky News on Monday deputy political editor Sam Coates spotted Shapps was calling him.The camera kept rolling as Coates answered and said: “Hello Grant Shapps, you’re live on Sky News.“I’m in the studio with Sophy Ridge. Have you seen you’re about to lose your seat, according to the Sky News-YouGov projection?”There was a moment’s silence before the phone emitted a few beeps, meaning Shapps was no longer there.Suella Braverman’s ‘cringey’ TikTok videoThe former home secretary was filmed doing a swaggering dance to the soundtrack of Fedde Le Grand and Ida Corr’s 2006 hit ‘Let Me Think About It’.She launched the new account on the social media platform last week with a handful of videos as part of her general election campaign, and it has already received tens of thousands of views.Keir Starmer and the Labour PartyStarmer draws laughter after mentioning toolmaking father... AgainSir Keir Starmer was met with groans and laughs from the audience as he told Beth Rigby his father was a toolmaker during last week’s Sky News debate.The Labour leader has repeatedly told voters about his childhood during the general election campaign.When pressed on his current financial situation and if he would “personally” be happy to pay more tax, Sir Keir admitted he “earns a lot of money now”.“But when I grew up, my dad was a toolmaker, he worked in a factory,” he added, drawing laughter with the repeated line.Sir Keir freezes after being called ‘political robot’ during debateDuring the same debate, the Labour leader was taken off guard when he was described as a “political robot” by a member of the audience.“I admired how in touch you were with the public when you were a solicitor and director of public prosecutions for the CPS,” an audience member, from Yorkshire, began.“But over the last year... You seem more like a political robot. How are you going to convince others like me to vote for you?”The question drew laughter from others in the crowd and saw Sir Keir pause for a few seconds before responding.Dawn Butler raps in campaign video to mark 21 days until general electionDawn Butler has released a video of herself rapping to mark the three-week countdown to the general election.The Labour candidate, battling for the Brent East seat, shared a clip of herself singing over a remixed version of “21 Seconds” by So Solid Crew.“We’ve got 21 days to go,” Ms Butler sings, before referencing Rishi Sunak’s D-Day blunder and labelling previous Tory prime ministers “corrupt”.The clip has already been viewed more than500,000 times.Ed Davey and the Liberal DemocratsEd Davey falls into Lake Windermere Sir Ed Davey took a dive into Lake Windermere while paddleboarding as he outlined his party’s plan to tackle the sewage crisis.Local Lib Dem candidate Tim Farron joined his party leader at Low Wood Bay Watersports Centre where the pair had mixed success, being pictured taking multiple plunges.During his visit to the Lake District, Sir Ed said local environmental experts should be represented on water companies’ boards to ensure sewage spills are taken seriously, as he accused Conservative ministers of “sitting on their hands”.Rubber ring on waterslide The Lib Dem leader slid down a waterslide riding a rubber ring as the party campaigned about children’s mental health on Thursday, 30 May.He wore swimming shorts and a T-shirt to ride down the Ultimate Slip n Slide attraction near Frome, Somerset.Defending the stunt, Sir Ed said: “Politicians need to take the concerns and interests of voters seriously but I’m not sure they need to take themselves seriously all the time and I’m quite happy to have some fun.”Sir Ed’s Frome and East Somerset visit was to support the campaign of his party’s candidate Anna Sabine and highlight their pledge to improve mental health support for young people."

They’re not a force to confront them, they’re simply an echo of them.”“They would make them worse. More taxes, more spending, more borrowing, more wokery, more nonsense. They wouldn’t hold them back, they’d encourage them to go further.”The Ipsos poll also estimated that Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, would win his seat in Clacton and the party would return a total of three MPs.It found that Jeremy Corbyn would lose his seat of Islington North to the new Labour challenger.The MRP (multiple regression and post stratification) surveyed almost 20,000 UK adults to predict the results in each constituency up for election on July 4.10:00 PM BSTThat’s all for today...Thank you for joining The Telegraph’s live coverage of day 25 of the general election campaign.My colleague Jack Maidment will be back tomorrow to guide you through the day’s developments.09:49 PM BSTIn pictures: Nigel Farage in ClactonNigel Farage takes a selfie with a supporter as he attends a campaign event in Clacton-on-Sea - Isabel Infantes/ReutersReform Party Leader Nigel Farage wears Spitfire decorated socks on stage at the Princes Theatre in Clacton on Sea in Essex - Peter Macdiarmid/London News Pictures LtdThe audience listen to Reform UK leader Nigel Farage speaking at Princes Theatre in Clacton - Ian West/PA09:30 PM BSTLabour government will buy up private beds for NHS, says Wes StreetingThe shadow health secretary has said he would buy up private beds for the NHS, in defiance of objections from “middle-class Lefties”, Laura Donnelly reports. Wes Streeting said a Labour government would get the NHS to buy thousands of beds from care homes, to “unblock” a failing health and care system, while expanding use of private hospitals for state-funded operations.Mr Streeting said there was “nothing Left-wing” about leaving working class patients to lie in pain because of “middle class Lefty” objections to the use of the private sector.Read more on this story from The Telegraph’s Health Editor here08:58 PM BSTWatch: Farage takes to stage in Clacton to Eminem’s ‘Without Me’Nigel Farage has concluded his event in Clacton, Essex, with voters.Earlier, the Reform Party Leader descended the stairs of Princes Theatre to the soundtrack of Eminem’s “Without Me”.Flanked by a pair of Union Jack flags and pyrotechnic flamethrowers, he strode onto the stage in a blue double-breasted blazer and revved up the crowd before commencing his speech.08:49 PM BSTComedian Tony Robinson hits campaign trail for LabourBlackadder actor and writer Tony Robinson has hit the campaign trail for Labour in Filton and Bradley Stoke near Bristol.In a video alongside Labour candidate Claire Hazelgrove, he said: “Fingers crossed.

We directly and legally and safely resettled 25,000 people from Syria and from refugee camps on Syria’s borders into the UK. That was the largest legal resettlement scheme in relation to Syria.”He added: “I’ve mentioned Ukraine already, 200,000 Ukrainians have been welcomed here to the UK, a similar number of people from Hong Kong fleeing oppression by the communist regime, and Afghanistan.”Challenged on those from Afghanistan waiting to be granted asylum to Britain, Mr Philp said: “The Home Office is working to bring those people safely into the United Kingdom and that work is happening as we speak.“So where there is a real need, then this country rightly welcomes people, but it does have to be done in a safe and legal way. We’re probably going to come on to small boats later, but that is not the way to organise asylum.”07:55 PM BSTPhilp: We should use our trade freedoms to trade more with developing worldChris Philp has said that Britain should use its post-Brexit “trade freedoms” to trade more with the developing world in order to boost global prosperity.He told the Channel 4 debate: “I don’t think mass migration would be particularly good either for the country where people were leaving, or indeed potentially Western countries to which people might be going, so I think we should try and find ways of avoiding that happening.“And there are two components, I think, to that. The first of those is peace and the second is prosperity. “He added: “People can become more prosperous by building businesses, and by exporting and importing. Now, the UK has recently jumped up the export league table. We’re now, I think, fourth in the world for exports.“But I’d like to see us using our free trade freedoms we now have to trade more with other countries, particularly in the developing world.”07:41 PM BSTLabour sets out how it intends to tackle the small boats crisisNick Thomas-Symonds has called the Rwanda scheme “completely unworkable” as he set out Labour’s plans for a Border Security Command to tackle small boat crossings.He told the Channel 4 debate: “We would scrap the Rwanda scheme, which is completely unworkable. They poured hundreds of millions of pounds down the drain to essentially send two volunteers, and a couple of Tory home secretaries, there so far.”He added: “There’s a small boat operations plan that’s part of Border Force. What our Border Security Command will do is bring together the Border Force, it will bring together immigration enforcement, it will bring together the Crown Prosecution Service international and, crucially, our security services.”Asked whether Labour would process the 40,000 asylum seekers who had come to the UK since 2023 and were “stuck in limbo”, Mr Thomas-Symonds said: “Well, that’s exactly what is going to have to happen.And what will happen then is those who are found to have no right to be here, we will get a proper enforcement and returns agreement in the Home Office, if we are privileged enough to govern, that will actually then deport people who are not entitled to be here.“That’s the flights that will be taking off on the Labour government, not wasting money on Rwanda.”07:24 PM BSTPictured: Voters wait for Nigel Farage ahead of Clacton Q&A eventVoters wait for Reform Party Leader Nigel Farage at the Princes Theatre in Clacton on Sea in Essex - Peter Macdiarmid/London News Pictures Ltd07:19 PM BSTGreens: Politicians ‘like to scapegoat migrants for problems with underfunding in public services’The co-leader of the Green Party has said that a number of politicians “like to scapegoat migrants for the problems with underfunding in public services”.Carla Denyer told the Channel 4 debate: “If you meet a migrant in the NHS, they’re more likely to be treating you than to be ahead of you in the queue.“Now some politicians, and unfortunately, the list of which politicians that is is getting longer, like to scapegoat migrants for the problems with underfunding in public services.“When in reality, the cause of that is decades of decisions to underfund those public services by political parties.”She added: “They could choose to make bold decisions about how you pay for public services and how you raise those funds, and the Green Party is the only party in England being honest about that.”07:11 PM BSTWatch: Richard Tice challenges Labour on net migrationRichard Tice, chairman of Reform UK, has challenged Labour on whether it had a target level of net migration.He asked Nick Thomas-Symonds on the Channel 4 debate: “What’s the number of net migration that you think is right for this country?“The Labour frontbencher responded: “Richard, a number is not a plan.”Mr Tice said: “The truth is that the Conservative Party have allowed mass immigration in the last two years deliberately, in complete contrast to what they promised election after election.”He added: “One person is arriving legally every minute. That means we need to build a new home just for those arriving every two minutes.”07:06 PM BSTPhilp: ‘No question’ the British public want lower net migrationThere is “no question” that the British public want lower net migration, Chris Philp has said.The Policing Minister was asked to respond to a Channel 4 poll that found that fewer people trusted the Conservatives on their pledge to cut net migration than Labour.Mr Philp told the Channel 4 debate: “Well, there’s no question that the British public want net migration to be lower. They’re right. We agree. It does need to be lower.He added: “There were about 200,000 or more from Ukraine and a similar number from Hong Kong. But we need to get the family and work numbers down as well. And we have already, not in the future, but we have already taken action on that.”07:01 PM BSTLabour and Tories clash over prisonsLabour has accused the Tories of releasing prisoners deemed to be a threat to the public on its early release scheme aimed at tackling overcrowding in jails.The scheme, introduced last year, allows prisoners to be released up to 70 days earlier, but Labour has refused to say whether or not it would be continued if they entered government.Asked whether or not the scheme would be kept under Labour, Nick Thomas-Symonds said: “We will not release prisoners who are assessed to be a threat to the public on that scheme, which is what this government has been doing. We need those 20,000 additional places.“What we will do is change the planning rules. We will declare this of national importance”Chris Philp, the policing minister, told the Channel 4 debate: “Let me be clear that no one who is a threat to the public is ever going to get released early.“Last year, we had 35,000 more successful criminal justice outcomes than we had the previous year.

And yes, of course a vaccine is good and we’re investing in research and development but that is going to take some time. So culls have to be part of the solution.“And particularly when it comes to badgers, when you look around the world, there’s no country that I think I know of where they’ve eliminated TB in cattle without eliminating it in, whether it’s possums or badgers or the equivalent wildlife, which is why I think culls are important.”03:28 PM BSTWatch: Sunak left sheepish after trying to feed flockRishi Sunak and Lord Cameron struggled to feed sheep on a campaign visit to a farm in north Devon.“Come on,” the Prime Minister said as the flock ran to the other side of the pen.“They don’t want to play ball,” a farmer accompanying Mr Sunak said.Rishi Sunak and David Cameron are attempting to feed sheep at a farm in North Devon.

Even on the current dire polls for the Conservatives, Reform have five seats, six seats and I don’t think they’ll be able to make that leap in time.“But clearly [Farage] has been a big spoiler for our party, for the Conservatives, and if the idea to have a snap election, which after all that is what it was, it was the Prime Minister who decided, nobody anticipated this, but if the idea was to try and spike Reform’s guns and prevent Nigel getting momentum I think that hasn’t gone well because he’s clearly getting momentum and he’s clearly enjoying himself on the campaign trail.”11:20 AM BSTKwasi Kwarteng: Tories must fight ‘more aggressive campaign’Kwasi Kwarteng has urged Rishi Sunak to fight a “more aggressive campaign” against Sir Keir Starmer and the Labour Party.The former chancellor, who is not contesting this general election, told GB News: “I think we need to fight a more aggressive campaign.

I do want to find a way through this because I think in the end we have to find a way.“But doing this in a way which doesn’t have the approval of victims of terrorism in Northern Ireland… and doing it in the teeth of the political parties in Northern Ireland, in my experience having worked in Northern Ireland is not a sensible way to proceed.”09:59 AM BSTLabour leader mocks Tories for turning to Boris JohnsonSir Keir Starmer has mocked the Tory campaign for turning to Boris Johnson to appeal to wavering voters in the final weeks before the general election.The Telegraph revealed that signed letters from Mr Johnson to tens of thousands of voters will be landing on doormats this week in a new Tory direct mail drive.Sir Keir joked on LBC that the push amounted to a “third or fourth relaunch” of the Conservative election plan, adding “for Heaven’s sake!”Sir Keir said: “If you can’t even have a strategy that holds for six weeks you really don’t deserve to win.”09:52 AM BSTSack civil servants who can’t cut budgets, says Reform’s Richard TiceSenior civil servants should be fired if they fail to make budget cuts, Richard Tice has said.The Reform UK chairman said the country should be run in the same way as a “business that’s in trouble”, with officials held to account for the “waste everywhere” in Whitehall.He also called for all quangos and commissions to be abolished, arguing “no one would notice a blind bit of difference” if they were scrapped.You can read the full story here. 09:47 AM BSTStarmer suggests he would have served in Corbyn governmentSir Keir Starmer suggested he would have served in Jeremy Corbyn’s Cabinet if Labour had won the 2019 general election.The Labour leader was asked repeatedly during a phone-in on LBC if he would have served in an administration led by Mr Corbyn and he initially dismissed the questions as “hypothetical”.He said that “it didn’t cross my mind because I didn’t think we would win” and “I don’t think anybody thought we were going to win”.Sir Keir was later asked if he would have followed Mr Corbyn into government and he replied: “It is hypothetical... if we had got it over the line there were important things that I thought needed to be done from the frontbench, to continue and complete on the Brexit work, to make it absolutely clear that the Labour Party never deviated from our position on Nato and to do the necessary work on anti-Semitism.“But as we went into that 2019 election I genuinely did not think, and I wasn’t alone in this, that Labour would win that election.”Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, appears on an LBC phone-in this morning - Aaron Chown /PA09:33 AM BSTStarmer refuses to rule out council tax increaseSir Keir Starmer refused to rule out a Labour government increasing council tax.Asked if he could say today that there would not be an increase in council tax under Labour, Sir Keir told LBC: “What I am not going to do is sit here two and a bit weeks before the election and write the budgets for the next five years.“What I can say is that none of our plans require a tax rise and that is for a reason and the reason is our focus is on getting our economy going...”Told that it sounded like council tax could therefore increase, Sir Keir said: “It would be foolish to write five years’ worth of budgets, going through to 2029, on air.”Sir Keir’s comments came after Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow paymaster general, said yesterday that Labour would not revalue council tax bands.Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, takes part in an LBC phone-in this morning - Aaron Chown/PA09:25 AM BSTStarmer urges junior doctors to call off election campaign strike actionSir Keir Starmer has called on NHS doctors to call off strike action which is planned during the general election campaign.The Labour leader told LBC: “We would firstly, and Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, has made this very clear, we would say to the doctors don’t strike during the election campaign because we are very close now to the opportunity for a different approach with a Labour government if we get over the line.“So don’t strike because that causes all sorts of issues inevitably for patients.

But we are absolutely confident in the measures that we’re putting forward.“We know the difference that can be made.

If you asked that question I would rule that out straight away. We wouldn’t increase that inheritance tax on small family farms.“I think it is fairly symptomatic of Labour policy that they won’t rule out these taxation increases.

Hunt could be among the Conservative casualties on the night of the 4 July poll, despite his newly-created seat in Godalming and Ash currently holding a Conservative majority of more than 10,000.Hunt is facing a battle to win the seat in Surrey, with the Liberal Democrats keen on taking a high-profile scalp. The Conservatives are predicted to win 34% – with the Lib Dems just one percentage point behind. Hunt said the newly-created seat was “very marginal”, and told broadcasters he is “fighting for every vote”.The Ipsos poll is suggesting a large Labour majority in the general election. (Ipsos)Jeremy Hunt: My constituency is on a knife edgeHe added: “I think that I can win the seat. But I don’t take anything for granted.“It is on a knife edge. And that’s what I’m knocking on doors for, six hours every day, meeting lots of people, making the arguments.”Were Hunt to lose, he would potentially be the highest-profile Tory to be rejected by voters. However, several other Tory ‘big beasts’ also face a tight vote to hold onto their seat, according to a major poll by Ipsos.Grant ShappsDefence secretary Grant Shapps may lose his seat in the election.

Labour are a sitting at 27% but Reform UK are polling 30%.Allowing for margins of error and another two weeks of campaigning, the seat will be hotly contested between all three parties on 4 July.Jacob Rees-MoggJacob Rees-Mogg is on track to lose his seat at the general election. (PA)While no longer a government minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg losing his North East Somerset and Hanham seat would perhaps be one of the night’s bigger surprises.

The Telegraph,All the ways Keir Starmer could hammer ‘non-working’ people,"['Scrap or slash the £20,000 Isa allowance', 'Cut the personal savings allowance', 'Cut tax relief for pensioners', 'Reduce the tax-free lump sum', 'Remove inheritance tax allowance on pensions', 'Equalise capital gains and income tax']",Charlotte Gifford,19 June 2024 at 6:54 am·6-min read,19,June,2024,06:54:00,6,"The Labour leader has made 'no tax rises for working people' a key commitment in the party's manifesto - Stefan Rousseau/PASir Keir Starmer has fuelled fears that Labour could be planning a tax raid on savings and pensions.The Labour leader has made “no tax rises for working people” a key commitment in the party’s manifesto.But in a radio interview yesterday, Sir Keir appeared to define “working people” as those with insubstantial savings.“People who earn their living rely on our [public] services and don’t really have the ability to write a cheque when they get into trouble,” he told LBC.“So the sort of people I’m meeting pretty well every day now. It’s quite a big group because these days there are many people obviously not so well off.”ADVERTISEMENTSenior Tories have leapt upon the remarks, with Jeremy Hunt saying Labour had “let slip [its] true plans to raise taxes across the board”.Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves seemed to distance herself from Sir Keir’s comments when asked about them on Wednesday.She told the Today programme: “Working people are people who get their income from going out to work every day, and also pensioners that have worked all their lives and are now in retirement, drawing down on their pensions.”Here, Telegraph Money outlines some of the ways Labour could increase the tax take from savers and pensioners if it gets into power.Scrap or slash the £20,000 Isa allowanceSavers can currently stash £20,000 a year into Individual Savings Accounts and pay no tax on the returns.Isas are expected to save people a total of £6.7bn in 2023-24. This is up from £4.9bn in 2022-23, as higher interest rates have made the tax relief more expensive.The growing cost of Isas could make them an obvious target for Ms Reeves if Labour gets into power.The Resolution Foundation has previously said that Isas are costly for the Government and “overwhelmingly benefit the better off”. It has therefore called for a lifetime cap on the amount that can be saved into an Isa, at £100,000.But a new government could also decide to lower or scrap the annual allowance entirely. The £20,000 exemption is more than half the annual salary of an average worker (earning £35,000) and, in 2020-21, only 7pc of Isa holders maxed out their annual allowance.Story continuesSo it is possible Labour could decide to replace the system with something else. The Resolution Foundation said expanding auto-enrolment could boost low levels of household saving.The think tank’s chief executive Torsten Bell took leave from his role earlier this month to run for Labour MP in Swansea West in Wales.Cut the personal savings allowanceLabour could raid people’s savings by cutting or reducing the personal savings allowance.A growing number of people have been forced to pay tax on their savings for the first time because of frozen thresholds.Basic rate taxpayers must pay tax once they earn more than £1,000 in savings income, dropping to £500 for higher-rate taxpayers.Neither of these bands have changed since the allowance was introduced in 2016 – despite savings rates having soared over the last few years.Sarah Coles, of stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “It’s worth bearing in mind that for those with substantial savings, both Labour and the Conservatives have a tax sting in the works.“Once you earn interest beyond the allowance outside an Isa, you will pay income tax. Both parties have refused to address frozen income tax thresholds, which means more people risk moving into a higher tax bracket, where they lose at least some of their allowance, and pay tax on their savings at a higher rate too.”Cut tax relief for pensionersSavers get tax relief on their pension contributions at their marginal rate of tax (20pc, 40pc or 45pc).Helen Morrissey, of investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, said tinkering with pension tax relief is one option Labour could consider.“Previous comments from Rachel Reeves have been unearthed where she backed a flat rate of around 33pc of tax relief - this would be a boost to the pensions of basic rate taxpayers but a cut for those on higher and additional rates.“These comments date back several years and Labour has said it is not current policy but it could prove a tempting option to opt for a flat rate that could be pegged at around 33pc, or possibly even lower.”Labour could also slash the annual allowance – the amount someone can save into their pension each year before having to pay tax. This stands at £60,000.Reduce the tax-free lump sumOne way for Labour to raise further tax on pensions would be to reduce the amount people can withdraw from their pots tax-free.Once you reach the age of 55, you can take 25pc of the amount as a tax-free lump sum. The maximum amount is £268,275.Simon Allister, of LGT Wealth Management, said: “It must be said that pensions are, at present, very tax efficient indeed for wealthy individuals. There is a conversation to be had about how sustainable that is.“We have many clients who were net beneficiaries of the abolition of the lifetime allowance. There was always a question mark as to whether Labour would reintroduce the previous legislation. This ‘will they, won’t they?’ was a big point of curiosity for our clients. Our general view was that the Lifetime Allowance ‘ship had likely sailed’, however, we do predict that pensions are an area they will look to tighten.”Remove inheritance tax allowance on pensionsPension pots are not currently included in the value of an estate for inheritance tax purposes.This has led to more and more people loading up their pensions with the aim of bequeathing these to their children and grandchildren.The Institute for Fiscal Studies, a think tank, has said this is an “eccentric” part of the tax system that needs to be addressed. It has urged the Government to scrap the tax break, estimating this would raise £1.9bn a year in revenue.Labour has said that it has no plans to remove inheritance tax relief for pensions. But it may feel tempted to follow the recommendations of the IFS as it looks to raise revenue.Nicholas Nesbitt, of tax advisory firm Forvis Mazars, said: “Perhaps the most anomalous area of pension taxation is the treatment of pension funds on death – they can broadly pass on free of tax.“It seems entirely possible that a future government would look to tax pension assets on death.”Equalise capital gains and income taxThere has been plenty of debate around Labour’s plans for capital gains tax, which was conspicuously absent from the party’s manifesto.Capital gains tax is due on profits worth over £3,000 when people sell investments or second homes.The rates are charged at 10pc to 28pc. Some have argued this creates a disparity where workers’ salaries are taxed more heavily than “unearned income”.Ms Reeves voiced her support for raising capital gains tax rates in a 2018 pamphlet called The Everyday Economy. However, she published this six years ago, before becoming Shadow Chancellor.Bringing the rates in line with income tax would see investors paying higher charges when selling investments or second homes.Williams Steven, of advice firm Killik & Co, said: “Now is as important as ever to make sure you are utilising any tax allowances you have available – particularly, saving into Isas and pensions – to ensure you are not subject to unnecessary capital gains tax.”Labour was contacted for comment."
The Guardian,European Commission warns France over fiscal rules as election looms,[],Jennifer Rankin,19 June 2024 at 8:07 am·3-min read,19,June,2024,08:07:00,3,"The European Commission has issued a reprimand to France for breaking EU fiscal rules before an election where the frontrunners are making lavish spending promises.The EU executive’s decision to launch the “excessive deficit procedure” against France is a blow to Emmanuel Macron – with a deficit well above the EU threshold – and also sets up a collision course with a post-election government potentially dominated by the far-right or the left coalition.Both groups have made large spending pledges ahead of legislative elections on 30 June and 7 July and, according to polls, are leaving Macron’s Renaissance party trailing in third place.The far-right National Rally has pledged to repeal Macron’s hard-fought pension reform and reduce the retirement age for those who began work in their teens. Marine Le Pen’s party also wants to reduce VAT on food and fuel, and in the 2022 presidential campaign promised to exempt workers under 30 from income tax.The New Popular Front, which unites the left, wants to reduce the retirement age to 60, raise the minimum wage and freeze the prices of food, energy and fuel.The current finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, warned that “a Liz Truss scenario was possible”, if National Rally implemented its economic programme, referring to how the short-lived British prime minister spooked financial markets with plans for big unfunded tax cuts. He has made similar warnings about the spending plans of the left.France’s deficit – the difference between government spending and revenues – was 5.5% of economic output in 2023 and is forecast to remain at 5% in 2025, well above the EU threshold of 3%. Government debt was 110.6% of gross domestic product in 2023 and is forecast to increase to 113.8% by 2025, compared with the EU limit of 60% of GDP. “The debt sustainability analysis indicates high risk over the medium term,” the commission said.Six other member states in breach of EU deficit rules were put into the same procedure on Wednesday: Belgium, Italy, Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovakia.Under new rules agreed last year, rule-breaking countries must reduce “excessive” deficits by 0.5% a year. But in an attempt to avoid hurting economic growth, the rules allow more flexibility for spending on defence, green and digital policies.In theory, repeat rule breakers could be fined, but no country has ever faced this sanction, amid fears it could worsen the economic situation and fuel political tensions.EU officials will not set out explicit recommendations to rule-breaking countries on how to reduce the deficit until after a new commission takes office on 1 November. These deficit-reduction plans would also have to be endorsed by EU finance ministers.The EU economy commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, declined to comment on the French parties’ spending plans, merely saying that he was confident that discussions with a future French government would be “useful and with a good conclusion”.Gentiloni, a former Italian prime minister, rejected suggestions that the obligation to reduce deficits signalled a return to austerity: “Our economic and fiscal policies are now entering a new cycle. This does not mean back to normal, because we are not living in normal times; and definitely not back to austerity, because this would be a terrible mistake.”"
The Independent,Rishi Sunak dubbed ‘pound shop Farage’ during hour-long LBC mauling,[],Archie Mitchell,19 June 2024 at 2:51 am·5-min read,19,June,2024,02:51:00,5,"Rishi Sunak has endured a brutal hour-long radio phone in which he was accused of “lying through his teeth” and dubbed a “pound-shop Nigel Farage” over his record on LGBT rights.The prime minister faced a grilling from callers furious at the Conservatives’ 14-year record on the state of the NHS and housing - as well as the party’s decision to accept millions from controversial donor Frank Hester.In a sign of the electoral challenge facing Mr Sunak, he was given a markedly frostier reception than Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who faced LBC listeners 24 hours earlier.Rishi Sunak was accused of ‘lying through his teeth’ in the phone-in (LBC)In one of the most brutal moments of the show, a gay man accused Mr Sunak of being “obsessed with divisive culture wars” and called him a “pound-shop Nigel Farage”.The man, who has lived with HIV for more than 16 years, said the PM has “behaved disgracefully” toward the trans community and during the visit of murdered teenager Brianna Ghey’s mother to parliament.Click here for our live coverage of the general election campaign.“So is it fair to say that you are anti-LGBT rights… and that you are obsessed with divisive culture wars?” Mr Sunak was asked.In what became a common refrain for the prime minister, he told the caller he was “sorry to hear that you feel that way” adding: “I care very much about making sure that people, whatever their backgrounds, are respected and treated with compassion and sensitivity.”He was then confronted by a caller named Ellen, who said that “as a young person in this country, everything about my future feels more uncertain”.Ellen said housing is unaffordable, tuition fees have soared and public services including the NHS are crumbling.Mr Sunak failed to address the points directly, but said if re-elected he would make it easier for young people to buy their own homes.He also said the Conservatives have improved the quality of rental accommodation and put new safeguards in place for renters.In another cutting moment for Mr Sunak, Ellen said: “Frankly, I think you’re lying through your teeth. You have had a decade and a half to improve housing, rental conditions and any of the issues I talked about and young people just don’t believe your promises anymore.”Mr Sunak again told the caller he was “sorry you feel like that”.In the Labour leader’s LBC phone-in, he was challenged by callers over Labour’s plans to introduce VAT on private school fees, his past support for Jeremy Corbyn and potential tax hikes under a Labour government.But he faced a notably less hostile audience, while Mr Sunak struggled for respite.The brightest spot of the PM’s interview was when he was asked about inflation returning to the Bank of England’s 2 per cent target, a rare boost for the PM during the general election.Mr Sunak acknowledged it has been a tough few years, but said the easing of price increases would be “very good news” for households. “But the headaches kept piling up for Mr Sunak, who was confronted by Figen Murray, the mother of Manchester Arena bombing victim Martyn Hett, over why he has not passed a law in her son’s honour yet.Figen Murray, mother of Manchester Arena bombing victim Martyn Hett, arriving in Downing Street (Stefan Rousseau/PA) (PA Wire)The prime minister was asked why it is referred to as a “priority” in the Conservative Party manifesto despite him promising Ms Murray 18 months ago that he would pass it.She said: “You have put in your manifesto that Martyn’s law is a priority. I don’t know what you mean by that because you promised me 18 months ago, in a phone call on what would have been Martyn’s 35th birthday, that you’re going to really hurry up with Martyn’s law and you’re very committed to it. And there has been nothing since then.”The PM said he is still planning to pass the law before summer recess if he is re-elected, despite only having a week of time scheduled between the reopening of parliament after the election and MPs going on their holidays.He was also attacked by a caller over the party’s decision to keep millions of pounds donated by Frank Hester, who said Labour veteran Diane Abbott “makes you want to hate all black women” and “should be shot”.He has given £15m to the Conservatives, and Mr Sunak said the businessman has apologised and should be allowed to move on from the comments he made in 2019.Mr Sunak even compared Mr Hester to Ms Abbott, who was suspended from the Labour Party last April for a letter the MP wrote suggesting Jewish people are not subjected to the same racism as some other minorities.The PM told LBC: “Diane Abbott has been readmitted into the Labour Party, and she herself had made some comments in the past that weren’t appropriate, but she apologised for those and was readmitted back into the Labour Party after having the whip withdrawn.”The interview ended on a positive, if embarrassing, note for the prime minister when he was asked to wish his predecessor Boris Johnson a happy birthday.Mr Johnson has so far not returned from his summer holidays to hit the campaign trail for the Conservatives, and is not expected to do more than sign off on some letters and record videos backing Tory candidates.But Mr Sunak said: ““I hope he is having a good day”.“It’s been great having him supporting the Conservative Party, he has been endorsing lots of candidates with videos and letters and that is really great and makes a big difference,” Mr Sunak added."
The Telegraph,"SNP would have mandate for independence even after an election wipeout, says Swinney","['‘Success would not be guaranteed’', '‘Manifesto can be summed up in one word’', 'NHS', 'EU', 'Defence']",Simon Johnson,19 June 2024 at 8:23 am·5-min read,19,June,2024,08:23:00,5,"The SNP will have a mandate for another independence referendum even if it suffers an election wipeout, John Swinney has insisted as he unveiled his party’s manifesto.The prospectus said Mr Swinney would have the democratic right to open “immediate negotiations” with the UK Government for another referendum if the party wins a majority of Scotland’s 57 seats.Speaking at the launch event in Edinburgh, the First Minister said the SNP achieving this benchmark of 29 seats would “intensify the pressure to secure Scottish independence.”But he repeatedly refused to accept that Scots would have voted to remain in the UK if his party failed to achieve its target, and a majority of seats was won by the Unionist parties.Mr Swinney insisted that the SNP would still retain a separate mandate for independence from the 2021 Holyrood election, despite it falling short of gaining a majority in that contest.He also said there would be no guarantee that an independent Scotland would succeed.‘Success would not be guaranteed’“Of course, an independent Scotland, like all countries, would face challenges. Success would not be guaranteed,” he said.“That would be determined by our own decisions as a country and the choices we make. But when we look at independent European countries similar to Scotland there are grounds for optimism and hope.”Mr Swinney’s refusal to accept that Scots would have voted to remain in the UK if his party failed to achieve its target followed a series of polls showing the SNP is on course to lose well over half of the 48 seats it won in the 2019 general election, with Labour again having the largest number of Scottish MPs.Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, accused the SNP of focusing on “constitutional wrangling” rather than “what people care about day to day”. Both he and Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, have rejected authorising a second independence referendum.The SNP manifesto launch was a much smaller event than in previous elections, with the party struggling to raise funds while it is under the shadow of a police investigation into its finances.Peter Murrell, the party’s former chief executive and Nicola Sturgeon’s husband, has been charged with embezzlement. The manifesto itself was also much shorter at only 28 pages, about 20 fewer than in 2019.The first page contained the words in block capitals: “Vote SNP for Scotland to become an independent country.” It later claimed that leaving the UK was necessary to address the cost of living crisis and reduce poverty.The document argued Scots should vote SNP as “it is more important than ever for the mandate won in 2021 to be respected. At this election, we are asking you to vote for an independent Scotland.“If the SNP wins a majority of Scottish seats, the Scottish Government will be empowered to begin immediate negotiations with the UK Government to give democratic effect to Scotland becoming an independent country.”Mr Swinney clarified that his preferred way of doing this was a rerun of the 2014 referendum, with Westminster handing Holyrood the powers to stage another vote.The manifesto argued that the powers should be permanently transferred, allowing the SNP to stage repeated referendums until it won one, a scenario previously described by Unionists as a “neverendum”.Unveiling the manifesto in Edinburgh with a speech that mentioned independence 14 times, the First Minister said: “We must never lose faith in the power of the democratic voice of the people of Scotland.“In 2021 they voted for a Scottish Parliament with a clear majority for independence and for a referendum. That democratic choice must be respected. At this election we have the opportunity to reinforce the case for Scotland becoming an independent country.”However, he was challenged four times whether he would accept that independence had been rejected by the electorate if the SNP fails to win a majority of seats.‘Manifesto can be summed up in one word’The First Minister argued that him answering the question would be akin to “predicting the outcome of the election” and repeatedly referred to the 2021 result, in which the SNP won 40.3 per cent of the regional vote share.Craig Hoy, the Scottish Tory chairman, said: “The SNP’s entire manifesto can be summed up in one word – independence. The first page is dedicated solely to splitting up Scotland from the rest of the United Kingdom.“None of Scotland’s urgent priorities will get any focus from the SNP. For John Swinney, independence comes before the economy, the NHS and everything else.”The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the manifesto called for UK-wide spending to be “topped up”, with the cost met by tax rises, more borrowing and higher economic growth from the UK rejoining the EU.David Phillips, the economic think tank’s associate director, said: “However, in its call for Scottish independence, the SNP ignores the potential hit to economic growth from leaving the UK, and the big fiscal challenges an independent Scotland would immediately have to confront.”NHSThe SNP has demanded that the UK Government pumps an extra £10 billion annually into the NHS. It claims this would “address rampant inflationary pressures and improve performance”.In addition, it wants the UK Government to match the more generous pay deals the devolved government has agreed with NHS workers to prevent strikes, but is now causing it financial difficulties.This would cost a further £6 billion across the UK, which would result in a total boost to the Scottish Government’s budget of £1.6 billion.The party is also saying it would introduce a “Keep the NHS in Public Hands” Bill, which it says would protect the health service.EUThe SNP wants to “reverse the damage of Brexit and re-enter the single market restoring free movement for EU citizens.”However, it appears to concede that the UK will not be rejoining the EU, instead emphasising a “vision for an independent Scotland in the EU”.The manifesto states that Brexit has been a disaster for Scotland and wiped billions from the Scottish economy.However, there is no detail about how, even if Scotland was to achieve independence, it would meet membership requirements.DefenceThe SNP’s flagship defence policy is to scrap the Trident nuclear deterrent.It says the money saved from retiring Britain’s nuclear submarines could instead be spent on “conventional defence and public services”."

James Manning - PA Images via Getty ImagesThe Tories are heading for their worst election result in more than 100 years, according to a major new poll.In a further shattering blow for Rishi Sunak, the More In Common survey of more than 10,000 voters shows the party is on course to be left with just 155 MPs after July 4.Labour, meanwhile, are set to gain more than 200 seats to leave them with 406 and a majority of 162.More in Common also say there are 96 marginal seats where the Conservatives are currently within five points of victory.That means they could potentially end up with as many as 203 MPs - or as few as 107 - depending on how they perform on election day.The so-called MRP poll - which surveys more people than normal and gives a seat-by-seat prediction to try to come up with a more accurate forecast - puts the Lib Dems on 49 seats, the SNP on 18, Plaid Cymru on 2 and the Greens on 1.One small glimmer of hope for the Tories is that the poll is not as negative for them as last night’s Ipsos UK one, which forecast a 256-seat Labour majority.Luke Tryl, executive director of More in Common UK, said: “The fact that this projection showing the Conservatives barely holding 150 seats is one of the most favourable to the Conservatives shows how deep a hole the party finds itself in - with barely two weeks to go for them to change the dial.“Far from the narrowing in the polls many expected to see by now, the Conservatives’ position instead appears to be getting worse and only a small move away from them could see them reduced to 107 seats.“Labour on the other hand looks set to inherit a historic majority while remaining largely undefined in the eyes of the electorate.“While creating such a broad electoral coalition, that will span from Blue Wall Worthing to Blyth in the Red Wall, is a good problem to have in the short term, it points to potential difficulties in creating a governing agenda that unites such disparate tribes - especially when electoral cynicism is so high.”Related...A Tory Cabinet Minister Has Admitted Labour Are Heading For 'A Large Majority'Billionaire Tory Donor Backs Labour In Latest Blow For Rishi SunakLabour On Course For 256-Seat Majority As Tory Nightmare Comes True"

In that period 3.85m people applied to register in this period cmpared to 2.90m this time.Over 630,000 people applied to register to vote yesterday alone (18 June), as the deadline approached at midnight. This is the second-highest number on record, broken only on the 26 November 2019, when 660,000 people registered in one day.The latest figure of people on the parliamentary electoral register in the UK is 46,652,520, but it has not been updated since December 2023.Gen-Z not showing up?There has been much discussion over young voters not being democratically involved — with an exclusive Independent poll showing that a third of young people do not plan to vote.In fact, registration application among the youngest group of voters (18-25) is at just half of the 2019 equivalent period; with just 746,000 Gen-Z voters registering to vote since the election was called this year, compared to 1.4 million in the lead-up to the 2019 general election.It is also worth noting that a large chunk of the current under-25s group were not of voting age at the last general election. Therefore, a substantial portion of Gen-Z voters will not be registered to vote in this election, compared to other age groups.Nonetheless, people aged 35 and under were flocking to register to vote at the final hour, more than any other age group. Over half (55 per cent) of all registrations yesterday were in the 18-34 age group, and 164,000 of these were people aged 25 and under.People aged 25-34 have been the most keen to register overall, with 896,825 registrations since 22 May alone.Though the registration deadline has passed, applications for postal vote are still open until today (19 June) at 5pm.Voters in the July 4 general election will also need a valid form of photo ID, including a passport, driving licence, or blue badge."

Email amy-clare.martin@independent.co.ukThe actress told The Independent: “I’m alarmed by the lack of attention given to the rising tide of knife crime during this election campaign. Since my brother Ben’s tragic murder in 2008, over 1,000 teenagers have lost their lives, and the numbers keep climbing – an 81 per cent increase in knife crime in the last decade.“All evidence suggests this will worsen. Our trust’s recent survey revealed a worrying trend: one in four young people believe carrying a knife offers protection.“Loopholes in legislation and lax online age verification make it shockingly easy to acquire dangerous knives. Unsanctioned violent content on social media further exposes young minds to knife crime. The age of knife carriers is dropping too.“With a heavy heart, I fear more families will suffer our loss unless this issue is tackled urgently. Knife crime is a silent epidemic, and it’s time for political leaders to break the silence during this campaign.”Her intervention comes after a string of horrifying recent attacks, including the killing of 14-year-old schoolboy Daniel Anjorin in a sword rampage in April as he walked to school in Hainault, east London, and the stabbing of schoolgirl Elianne Andam, 15, at a bus stop in Croydon last year.James Bascoe-Smith was left with life-changing brain injuries after he miraculously survived an unprovoked knife attack in Brixton (PA)Patrick Green, CEO of the charity Ms Kinsella co-founded in her brother’s name, the Ben Kinsella Trust, said the shocking case this week of two 12-year-olds becoming Britain’s youngest killers since the murder of James Bulger highlights the urgent crisis.One of the knife-obsessed pair, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had posed on social media with a 17-inch long machete hours before they used it to murder 19-year-old Shawn Seesahai in a Wolverhampton Park.“This case really highlights everything that’s wrong – two 12-year-olds with a machete,” he added. “How does that happen? Surely that says an awful lot about where we are.“There’s a litany of failures in relation to knife crime and it’s frustrating for me that it’s not part of the debate and the focus is not on the safety of children.“Knife crime hasn’t been dominant in terms of the election debate so far.

With crime it is almost as if we have become immune to it and we have run out of ideas.”He said the recent case involving two 12-year-old killers “beggars belief”.Figures show offences involving a knife or sharp instrument increased by seven per cent last year – with 49,489 recorded by police between January and December 2023.This was up from 46,153 in 2022, but three per cent lower than pre-Covid pandemic levels.Rishi Sunak has promised to recruit 8,000 extra police officers.In Labour’s manifesto, published on Thursday, Sir Keir Starmer vowed to halve knife crime in a decade. Plans include bringing in tougher sanctions for those caught carrying knives and creating a “young futures” program with a network of hubs staffed with youth workers, mental health support workers and careers advisers to steer people away from knife crime."
The Independent,I can’t stop dreaming about Keir Starmer – help!,[],Louis Chilton,19 June 2024 at 7:11 am·4-min read,19,June,2024,07:11:00,4,"I have a strange confession to make. I can’t stop dreaming about Keir Starmer. Over the past few months, and particularly since next month’s general election was called, the Labour leader has appeared in my nocturnal imaginings on a semi-regular basis – as much as any real person I know. He stalks my psyche like Freddy Krueger, if Krueger was less interested in slicing up teens and more concerned with winning the approval of “Stevenage Woman”. It turns out I’m not the only one – after I mentioned this phenomenon at work, a colleague confessed to having Starmer dreams as well. You too may have spent the last few weeks dreaming of Starmer, or Ed Davey, or even Nigel Farage. Whatever the case, this is a safe and judgement-free space.My Starmer dreams aren’t violent. And no, before you ask, they’re not raunchy either. In fact, as dreams go, they’re pretty banal. In them, Starmer doesn’t really do anything of note, doesn’t utter so much as a “my father was a toolmaker”. The dreams take the form of some prosaic scenario – I’ll be at a house party with friends, for instance – and then he will simply be there, and I will spend the duration of the dream yelling at him, berating him, working myself into a veritable imaginative lather. (It may be worth pointing out here that I am actually not Starmer’s biggest fan.) They say you should never go to bed angry. But what if you keep waking up furious?It could be worse, of course: better to be dream-stalked by the visage of Starmer than, say, Adolf Hitler, or Genghis Khan. If nothing else, there’s also a sort of distinctly British modesty to it, as if my dreams were being organised by some cloutless, third-rate talent booker. (“Count Dracula is a no… would you take John Prescott?”)But what exactly is causing this personal Nightmare on Downing Street? I suspect it is a matter of political impotence. Maybe I’m subconsciously channelling my frustration around how voiceless I – and many others who are pro-immigration, pro-LGBT+ rights and anti-privatisation – currently feel when it comes to the Labour Party. If I can’t yell at the real Keir Starmer, this mental facsimile will have to do. Perhaps it’s something more abstract: Sigmund Freud might have suggested that this imaginary Starmer-shaped punching bag is in fact a stand-in for my father, or my mother, or has something to do with penises. But Freud, as we all know, was coked out of his gourd and it’s probably best to ignore him. (Besides, my dad would never be caught dead in the Arsenal home crowd.)Ultimately, the hows and whys don’t matter so much. The crux of the issue is I want these dreams to stop. I need Starmer cut from the cast of my nighttime fantasies, written out abruptly like David Caruso in the second season of NYPD Blue. So I asked chartered psychologist Dr Mark Rackley to shed some light on my dreams, in the hope that I could, in the words of Labour’s manifesto, “change”.“Dreams remain one of the great mysteries within psychological science,” he tells me. “And there is no common consensus as to why we dream or what purpose they serve.” As everyone likely knows first hand already, dreams, he says, can be “illogical”, have a “first-person perspective” and can “contain elements of waking life”. So far, so clear. But where does Starmer enter into this?“In the run-up to the general election, this can create anticipatory anxiety around what will happen and provoke strong negative emotional responses such as anger, fear, frustration and hopelessness,” Dr Rackley continues. “We can fear that the election will bring negative change to our lives and that we are powerless to stop this change from happening. This actual reality can then get played out in the dreams that we have and can produce some strange experiences in our dreams.”The man in my dreams: Keir Starmer, pictured in corporeal form on 5 June 2024 (Getty Images)Politicians like Starmer and Rishi Sunak are, he continues, “characters in our life”, even if we do not know them personally. “As dreams are involuntary experiences that are created by our unconscious mind, we can have dreams about politicians, talking to them and arguing with them and this can feel real, as when we dream, the feelings that are produced stay with us,” he adds. “This type of dream relates to our reality and is triggered by events that are familiar to us.”With all that said, is there any chance of stopping the dream? Of ridding my mind of Starmer via some kind of oneiric deep clean? It turns out it’s not that easy. “As dreams are involuntary experiences, we cannot predict or control them,” says Dr Rackley. “You cannot force the brain to produce or stop a dream; that is out of everyone’s control. The best we can do is seek to understand the process and not let the dream wreck our head too much!”It may not be what I wanted to hear, but hey – perhaps it’s not the end of the world. If I were plagued by dreams of Sunak, I’m not sure I’d ever sleep again."
