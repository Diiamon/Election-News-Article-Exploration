The Guardian,Labour’s path to a majority: the seats Starmer needs to win – mapped,['Data note'],Alex Clark and Ashley Kirk,4 July 2024 at 0:17 am·3-min read,4,July,2024,00:17:00,3,"Constituencies with relatively higher numbers of over-50s, homeowners and people of white ethnicity are key to Labour’s hopes of winning a majority at the election, Guardian analysis suggests.Experts have told the Guardian that, in order to appeal not just to its core voters but also to these middle-England swing seats, Labour is trying to make a broad pitch to the country.Labour holds 200 of the new constituencies in parliament, meaning that it needs to win another 126 seats to claim an overall majority in the election.Looking at the 150 seats that would be easiest for Labour to flip – marginals that require the smallest swing to overturn Conservative or SNP majorities – the analysis reveals that Labour will need to extend beyond their usual urban strongholds and appeal in more rural, older and less ethnically diverse areas.defaultThe analysis is based on the 150 seats that Labour would need to win assuming a uniform national swing, where the party gained consistently throughout the country. In reality, Labour’s gains would be less uniform than this, and more influenced by local factors and other parties contesting individual seats, meaning that they could win seats with higher swings needed and lose seats that required smaller swings.Labour currently enjoys a comfortable lead over the Conservatives in polling, but the scale of the shift among voters it needs to become the party of government is huge.The party must recoup widespread losses in the 2019 general election as well as make up for the impact of the recent review of constituency boundaries, which has disproportionately benefited the Conservatives.Overall Labour needs to gain at least 126 seats to achieve a working majority but upwards of 150 to do so comfortably.Stephen Fisher, a professor of political sociology at the University of Oxford, said: “Labour are making a broad pitch to the country. That inevitably means they are trying to appeal to the average voter and not just their core voters. At the last election Labour’s voters were younger, more urban, and more likely to be graduates than the electorate as a whole. To win a majority Labour need to appeal to different kinds of voters from the ones they persuaded last time, while still hanging on to those who supported them before.“The seats Labour need to win, and are the most winnable, are middle-ground or swing seats in the sense that they are the seats that if they swing to Labour then Labour will win, and if they don’t then the Conservatives will continue in power. If some do and some don’t – and there are no great surprises elsewhere – then we are likely to see a hung parliament.”Data noteEngland and Wales demographic figures are sourced from the ONS, using 2021 census data.The 2019 notional results data is sourced from PA Media, based on research from Colin Rallings, Michael Thrasher, David Denver and Nicholas Whyte, who have modelled and amalgamated the old results to the new boundaries.Majority means the winning party’s margin of victory over the second-placed party, while swing needed represents the share of votes needed to switch to Labour to overturn this majority.• This page was amended on 11 June 2024. In a previous version, Labour was incorrectly identified as the second-placed party in some constituencies, which led to errors in the figures given for the swing needed. These errors have been corrected. An initial version of this piece also expressed swing as a percentage relative to Labour’s current vote total. This has been changed to swing expressed as the change between Labour and the current party’s vote share."

Picture date: Wednesday July 3, 2024. (Photo by Jonathan Brady/PA Images via Getty Images) Jonathan Brady - PA Images via Getty ImagesTory voters have given up on the party’s ability to fix the UK’s problems, a new poll has revealed as the country goes to the polls.The research by More in Common for the New Britain Projects shows the scale of the growing disillusionment with the government’s performance among those who backed the Conservatives at the 2019 general election.A year ago, 40% of them believed “nothing in Britain works any more”. That figure has now soared to 61%.And while 44% thought “the social contract in Britain is broken” 12 months ago, the number feeling the same now has grown to 65%.The findings, based on a poll of 3,420 adults, are further evidence that the Tories are heading for a historic defeat in today’s election.The poll findings show how Tories have become disillusioned. New Britain ProjectAnna McShane, director of the New Britain Project, said: “This will be deeply worrying for the Conservatives. Our latest findings show that not only has the prime minister failed to convince voters that Britain has turned the corner, but people actually believe things have continued to get worse over the past year, particularly among those who voted Tory in 2019.“Last year, it seemed like 2019 Conservative and Labour voters were living on different planets, given how differently they responded to our poll questions.“Today, the feeling that ‘Britain is broken’ is all-pervasive. This shift helps explain why Keir Starmer’s poll lead has been so persistent.“Labour has said that if you want change, you need to vote for it. If people do indeed vote for that change, Starmer will need to quickly move from theoretical promises to implementing practical steps on the ground.“Incorporating frontline voices into policymaking will be crucial to ensure these policies actually work and to prevent the same disillusionment from hitting Labour.”Related...Tories Heading For 'Worst Election Result In Their History', New Poll RevealsTories On Course For Election Disaster As Labour Head For 1997-Style Win, New Poll SaysExclusive: Voters More Likely To Punish Labour For Not Improving The NHS Than Increasing Tax"

PM battles to stay in power after election gambleAs the prime minister calls a snap election, here’s everything you need to know about Rishi Sunak and what he’s saying about the biggest issues in British politics","['Early life', ""Sunak's family"", 'His parents', 'His education', 'How much is he worth?', 'His religion']",Hannah Fearn,23 May 2024 at 4:21 am·4-min read,23,May,2024,04:21:00,4,"Rishi Sunak enjoyed an astonishingly rapid ascent through the Tory party to become prime minister in 2022.A multimillionaire former hedge fund manager with an MBA from Stanford University in California and married to the daughter of one India’s richest men, he has however found it hard to shed the perception he is remote from the concerns of ordinary Britons.Early lifeSunak was born in Southampton in 1980, the eldest of three children. His Indian parents both arrived from East Africa in the 1960s. A football-mad boy whose childhood idol was Matt Le Tissier, Sunak was described by the family’s neighbours as a child with “lovely manners”.In his youngest years, the PM attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. According to a recent biography, fellow pupil Ollie Case said: “He was someone that was talked about. The teachers would say: ‘He’s going to be prime minister'.""But, growing up in the 1980s and 90s, he also remembers experiencing racism. “My mother was obsessed with us not having accents,” Sunak has said.Rishi Sunak was football-mad as a boy growing up in Southampton. (ITV)Sunak's familySunak is married to Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian entrepreneur and multi-billionaire. The pair first met in 2004 at Stanford University, his future wife apparently attracted to his “honesty and integrity”.Five years later they married in a two-day Indian wedding held in Bangalore. The couple have two daughters, Krishna and Anoushka, who will turn 13 and 11 this year, both of whom are largely kept out of the public eye.Sunak attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. (Rishi Sunak, Instagram)His parentsYashvir Sunak, Rishi’s father, was born in Kenya. He arrived in the UK to study medicine and then stayed, becoming an NHS GP. His mother, Usha, was born in Tanzania and is a pharmacist.The couple met in Britain and settled in Southampton in the 1970s. Usha is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.His educationAs a teenager Sunak studied at Winchester College where he was, he says, a self-confessed “geek”. According to a recent biography, the “naughtiest” thing the prime minister did during his school days “was to smuggle a hand-held television into the school so that he did not miss any key games of Euro 96”.The childhood home of Rishi Sunak in Southampton. (Getty Images, photo taken in 2022)Perhaps unsurprisingly for someone with such an unblemished record, he went on to become the school’s head boy. Sunak worked while studying, delivering medicines for his mother’s pharmacy and as a waiter at a local Indian restaurant.After school, Sunk read philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, graduating in 2001 with a first class degree. While still at university he held an internship at the Conservative Party campaign headquarters and joined the party, but went on studying before entering politics.He earned his MBA from Stanford in 2006 as a Fulbright Scholar, meaning he was selected among the most promising candidates from the UK.How much is he worth?Rishi Sunak's mother is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.As prime minister, Rishi Sunak earns £80,807 on top of a salary of £84,144 for being an MP. But his current income from Westminster pales in comparison to his family’s vast wealth through marriage.The Sunday Times valued the couple’s joint fortune at £730m. Murty's father is the co-founder of Infosys, an Indian tech conglomerate, in which she holds shares estimated at around £430m. Her family is also involved in a £900m business arrangement with Amazon in India, and she is a shareholder of multiple other companies.Before entering politics Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and a series of hedge funds. He is also known to have invested in blind trusts, in which investments are made without holders knowing where the funds are located. These arrangements reportedly hold Sunak’s own multi-million-pound fortune.Sunak, his wife Akshata and daughters Anoushka and Krishna (second left) at Santa Monica Pier, California, on their summer holiday in 2023. (AP)His religionSunak is not only the first prime minister of colour and of Indian heritage but he is also the first practising Hindu to hold the biggest job in UK politics.He has spoken of his pride in his Hindu faith, saying, “that’s how I was raised, and that’s how I am”. He said: “Having faith gives you resilience, gives you strength that is important and it provides an outlook on life which I find particularly valuable.”"
Yahoo News UK,"What time will we know the general election result?Ahead of the July 4 election, check out our guide to timings for polling day and counting night.","['When can I vote?', 'When are votes counted?', 'When should we expect the first results?', 'So does that mean I can have an early-ish night?', 'Okay, so when can I think about going to bed?', 'And will there be a result by then?', 'Which will be the last seat to declare?', 'Who is standing in my constituency?']",James Harrison,Updated 1 July 2024 at 1:37 pm·4-min read,1,July,2024,01:37:00,4,"After more than a month of active campaigning, all the hard work of the 2024 general election campaign will come to a hard stop at 10pm on Thursday, 4 July, when the final votes are cast.An exit poll will likely give us the first indication of how the election result will pan out but nothing will be finalised until the last ballot is counted.Here’s our breakdown of when to expect key developments throughout the night:When can I vote?Polling stations open from 7am. If you haven’t already registered to vote you’ve already missed the deadline and won’t be able to cast a ballot this time around.But, you can still apply for an emergency proxy vote as late as 5pm on polling day if you are suddenly unable to vote in person, so long as you are already registered.New rules and boundary changes mean you must have a valid photo ID to vote and your constituency may be different to the last election – you can use your postcode to check.Officially, polls close at 10pm, but if you are at least in the queue by then you should still be able to cast your vote past time.After that, votes are taken to counting halls run by the relevant local authority, ready to be sorted.From 10pm media can also start reporting exit polls, which given an early indication of how the parties are performing across the country.When are votes counted?First, ballots have to make it from polling stations to the counting hall, which could take minutes or hours, depending how far they have to travel.Once there, slips are verified to ensure they match data from their polling stations (such as the number of ballots issued throughout the day), before being mixed with postal votes for counting to begin in earnest.When should we expect the first results?A handful of seats usually manage to declare a result before midnight.Traditionally, this honour has fallen to one of the Sunderland constituencies, although at the last two elections, in 2019 and 2017, that crown was snatched by Newcastle Central.This time around, however, Newcastle has reportedly ruled itself out of the running for the top spot.Sunderland is usually one of the first areas to begin announcing election results.So does that mean I can have an early-ish night?That depends. In 2019, one of the most significant results of the night was confirmed barely 90 minutes after close of polls (and that included a recount).There was a similar phenomenon in Sunderland during the Brexit referendum, when the scale of the result on Wearside gave an early indication of the final outcome.But with votes for 650 seats across the UK to count, you might be advised to stay up a little later if you’re really interested.Okay, so when can I think about going to bed?How early do you have to get up the next day?In 2019, returning officers managed to confirm almost 50 seats before 2am – a great improvement on 2015, when the figure was just 17.On the basis of the last two elections (which, like this one, were standalone polls without local authority and other votes going on at the same time, as happened in 2015), the bulk of results came between 2-5am, when results were being declared at a rate of almost three every minute.And will there be a result by then?Maybe. The magic number for a parliamentary majority is 326 seats, although in reality the actual number is slightly lower due to various factors.If a party pulled off the slightly implausible achievement of winning 326 seats consecutively, a result could be confirmed by about 3.30am, again, on the basis of previous elections.In reality, the process will likely take a lot longer.Which will be the last seat to declare?Probably St Ives, in Cornwall, which has taken the wooden spoon in two of the last three elections.In 2015 and 2019 it was well past lunchtime the day after the election before a result was declared.But in 2017 Kensington didn't confirm a shock victory in the seat until 9pm the day after, thanks to three recounts, although by that point the national result was a foregone conclusion.Who is standing in my constituency?Find your constituency on the map below to see the list of the candidates from the main political parties standing in your local area.If you aren't sure of the full name of your constituency, you can quickly search for its name by adding your postcode or location here.You can also check out our searchable database below to see a list of all the candidates standing in your area."

Here’s how it may unfold:10pm:  The exit poll“From about 11 o’clock in the morning, we’re poring over an exit poll, and from about 12 hours later, we’re shitting bricks as to whether it’s right or not.”So said Britain’s most trusted elections guru and developer of the UK general election exit poll, John Curtice, in a recent interview with the Guardian.Curtice, along with the statistician David Firth, created the model of exit poll that has been used in election coverage since 2005, which is based on voters in about 130 polling stations given a mock ballot.It is the first moment of election night to produce a tangible sense of where the voters stand. The prediction, based on data collected by asking people to cast a second replica ballot as they leave polling stations in England, Scotland and Wales, is shared by the BBC, ITV and Sky. The researchers tend to target the same constituencies at every election, enabling them to pick up changes in voting behaviour.In the past five general elections, the margin of error has ranged between 1.5 and 7.5 seats. In 1992 and 2015, they predicted a hung parliament with the Tories as the largest party, but the Conservatives ended up with majorities on both occasions.11pm:  Early resultsBased on initial estimates, which the Guardian emphasises are estimates, only about eight results will be in by 1am on Friday.Blyth and Ashington, and Houghton and Sunderland South, both in north-east England, are expected to be first at about 11.30pm on Thursday, and are forecast to be Labour holds.Blyth and Ashington is one of the shiny new constituencies created in the recent boundary review. The seat comprises most of the abolished constituency of Wansbeck, excluding the town of Morpeth, together with the town of Blyth from the abolished Blyth Valley constituency.Houghton and Sunderland South is historically one of the quickest, if not often the first, constituencies to declare. The national record is 10.43pm for the declaration for its predecessor seat, Sunderland South, set in 2001.Midnight to 3am:  A trickle of resultsThe quietest period of the night. About 85 seats are expected to be declared over the three hours, of which only a handful are on our list of “ones to watch” for upsets and bellwethers.The first of those will come early in Basildon and Billericay in Essex, expected to declare at about 12.15am. The Tory party chair, Richard Holden, was controversially selected to run in the seat for his party after serving the last five years as MP for North West Durham, nearly 300 miles away.At about 1.45am, a result could come in Swindon North, where polls have suggested Labour’s Will Stone could take the seat from the incumbent Conservative, the former minister and ex-deputy party chair Justin Tomlinson, who is defending a majority of 16,171.Rochdale, where George Galloway won a chaotic byelection in February for the Workers party, is expected at about 2.30am. Some polls have suggested Galloway is in for a shot at holding the seat against a challenge from the political journalist Paul Waugh, who is standing for Labour. Galloway’s byelection success came after Labour withdrew its support for its candidate over comments made about Israel’s conflict in Gaza.3am to 5am:  A rush of resultsThis window is the busiest and arguably most significant of the night. Results are expected for 443 of the 650 constituencies, meaning that by 5am, roughly 530 seats will have declared and there will be a clear direction of travel.Will the justice secretary, Alex Chalk, hold his seat in Cheltenham? Will the former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith return in Chingford and Woodford Green, where he has been MP since 1997? In Bristol Central, will Labour’s Thangam Debbonaire’s chance of returning to parliament be scuppered by the Green party gaining its second ever MP in co-leader Carla Denyer? We will find out between 3am and 4am.In Glasgow, a flurry of seats between 3am and 4am across the city will give us a flavour of how Labour and the Scottish National party are performing in Scotland, with Airdrie and Shotts announcing at a similar time.In Wales, Plaid Cymru has its biggest hopes pinned on the Ynys Môn and Caerfyrddin constituencies, which are also expected to declare between 3am and 4am.Belfast East, expected at 3am, will be watched particularly closely as the Democratic Unionist party’s interim leader, Gavin Robinson, is defending the marginal seat against the Alliance party leader, Naomi Long.Elsewhere around 3.30am, Jeremy Hunt will find out if he is returning to parliament as MP for Godalming and Ash, a newly formed constituency. He had held the now abolished South West Surrey seat since 2005, most recently with a majority of 8,817, but some polls have projected a Conservative loss in the new seat.Then it is over to the Nigel Farage show in Clacton, where at about 4am we will find out if the Reform UK leader will finally be elected as an MP after seven failed attempts. Reform’s former leader Richard Tice, who stood aside to allow Farage to tour television studios and represent the party in the campaign, will discover his own result in Boston and Skegness at a similar time.Progress by Labour and the SNP will be in focus again as Edinburgh North and Leith is called.At about 4.30am, Jacob Rees-Mogg will see if he is elected to represent North East Somerset and Hanham, where some polls have predicted he will lose to Labour’s Dan Norris, the incumbent metro mayor for the West of England combined authority.The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, will learn his own fate in the newly formed constituency of Richmond and Northallerton around 4am, while the Labour leader Keir Starmer’s seat is expected to be declared at 4.15am.5am to 7am:  The final resultsThe remaining seats should be declared by 7am, with perhaps a few exceptions. Between 5am and 6am, the result should be announced in North Cornwall, where the Tories’ Scott Mann will discover whether waning interest in Brexit has taken the wind out of his support. Alistair Strathern for Labour, Bim Afolami for the Conservatives and Chris Lucas for the Liberal Democrats will learn the outcome of their tight race in Hitchin, where housing pressures are to the fore.7am:  A new government?Will this be a moment of reckoning for the Conservative party, which faces the end of its 14-year rule? Or will it be the pollsters, who have consistently predicted a sizeable Labour majority, who face a moment of reflection and soul-searching if the party fails to meet their expectations? By 7am we should know, and whoever is set to form the government will be preparing various addresses from podiums and the big political debrief among the commentariat will commence.Viewing optionsBBC Huw Edwards’ departure required a new presenter for the BBC’s election night coverage. Rather than having one host, its coverage will be co-presented by Clive Myrie and Laura Kuenssberg, although which of them announces the exit poll and calls the final result – footage likely to be replayed for decades to come – remains to be seen.Chris Mason, Reeta Chakrabarti and Curtice will be analysing results in the studio at Broadcasting House in London, while Jeremy Vine and his swingometer have been sent to Cardiff. When dawn rises and it is clear who will be forming the next government, the team will hand over to Sophie Raworth and Jon Kay for the Friday morning shift.ITV When ITV first hired Ed Balls and George Osborne as pundits in 2017, it was seen as a coup to get two warring politicians on set together. Nowadays the pair are established as a friendly double act with their own podcast, so ITV has decided to spice things up by adding the former Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon to its lineup. The trio of political heavyweights will be providing analysis throughout the night alongside anchor Tom Bradby, plus reporters Robert Peston, Anushka Asthana and Paul Brand.Come dawn, Balls will slip into his other role as co-host of Good Morning Britain, potentially reporting on the formation of a Labour government featuring his wife and shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper.Sky NewsSky News has to think differently on election night, so is embracing the technology available in its studios. With the domestic football season over, its election night coverage will be hosted by Kay Burley from a 360-degree studio usually used by Sky Sports. The channel has also promised to use an “immersive, to-scale augmented-reality Downing Street” to reveal the exit poll and final result. Analysis of the contest will come from its political editor, Beth Rigby, Ed Conway and Trevor Phillips. Punditry will come from Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, and the former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson.Channel 4After years of providing “alternative” election night coverage featuring comedians, this year, Channel 4 is going straight. It is pitching at viewers who want political analysis and embracing centrist dads by leaning into the news podcast market. Emily Maitlis from the News Agents will host alongside Channel 4 News’s own Krishnan Guru-Murthy and Cathy Newman, with analysis from Alastair Campbell and Rory Stewart of The Rest Is Politics podcast. A late addition to the lineup is the ex-Tory minister Nadine Dorries, who unsuccessfully tried to privatise the channel and claimed it was biased towards the left.GB News Camilla Tominey and Stephen Dixon will lead the Ofcom-bothering channel’s election night coverage. Viewers have also been invited to watch the results roll in at a GB News election night party in an Essex nightclub.Other TV channels If you want a break after the exit poll – and can resist watching The Bear on Disney+ – you could calm down by switching to other channels after 10pm.

Yahoo News UK,Who is Ed Davey? The Lib Dem leader whose life has been marked by adversity,"['His early life', 'His family', 'His parents', 'His education', 'Why is he a Sir?']",Hannah Fearn,Updated 1 July 2024 at 11:04 am·3-min read,1,July,2024,11:04:00,3,"The youngest of three boys, Sir Ed Davey had a childhood marked by adversity. His mother died when he was a teenager and his father died when he was just four.As an adult, Davey now cares for his son, who is disabled with a neurological condition.So what do we know about the man who leads the third party in British politics?His early lifeEd Davey was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on Christmas Day in 1965. He was the youngest of three boys, but lost his father at just four years old and then his mother when he was in his mid-teens. She had spent three years battling cancer, during which time he nursed his mother together with his grandmother and brother Henry.Once a keen Scout and Air Scout, he later remembers feeling “isolated” at school because of his caring responsibilities, which meant he couldn’t take part in after-school activities or sports. “The last 18 months she was bedridden and in a lot of pain. I’d spend hours on the bed, talking to her,” he said. Davey was with his mother when she died at Nottingham General Hospital, after being placed on an unsuited dementia ward.After both his parents had died, Davey was brought up by his maternal grandparents in the village of Eakring, though his grandfather died soon after. He spent much of his childhood and young adulthood close to his grandmother. “First of all, she was looking after me. Then we were looking after each other,” he said.His familyDavey married Emily Gasson, a former Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate who unsuccessfully stood in four elections and is now a councillor, in 2005 and the pair have two children, a son and daughter.Their son, John, born in 2007 and now a teenager, is disabled with a neurological condition. He has attended special schools but is now educated at home with a tutor – a change that Davey said led to him becoming verbal for the first time. He has spoken about his anxiety about who will care for his son when he and his wife are no longer around. “It’s the thing that worries me more than anything else in my life,” Davey said.Gasson was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in 2012. She was well for many years following her diagnosis, but declined during lockdown and is working on recovering her physical strength.His parentsEd Davey, pictured with his family. (Liberal Democrats)His father, John, was a solicitor and his mother, Nina, a teacher. Davey has described how he was inspired to study by his mother, who always wanted him to try hard academically and who he wanted to impress.His educationDavey attended the private Nottingham High School, the alma mater of former chancellor Kenneth Clarke. He became head boy, with Labour MP Ed Balls – who was studying in the year below – watching on.After school, he achieved a first class degree in philosophy, politics and economics at Jesus College, Oxford where he was junior common room president. After becoming an economics researcher for the Liberal Democrats he returned to study, reading for a master’s degree in economics at Birkbeck College, London.Ed Davey as Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change alongside the then leader of the Lib Dems, Nick Clegg, and Jo Swinson, pictured during the coalition government in 2015.

The Guardian,French voters face choice of least worst option in high-stakes election,[],Ashifa Kassam in Meyzieu,3 July 2024 at 11:21 pm·7-min read,3,July,2024,11:21:00,7,"At a market in Meyzieu, a small commune on the outskirts of Lyon, Kheira Vermorel eyed a box filled with potatoes, wondering if the sizeable spuds would be enough to soothe tensions at home.For weeks – specifically since France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, plunged the country into shock snap elections – she and her husband had been at odds. “It’s been really hard,” she said. “I’m worried it might lead to a divorce.”At the heart of their weeks-long dispute was the forthcoming ballot. Last election Vermorel, who moved to France from Algeria 35 years ago, voted for Macron. This time, however, she was convinced that it was time to give the political class a shake by casting her vote for the far-right, anti-immigrant National Rally (RN).“Politicians don’t show up, they talk, they always promise things but nothing happens,” said the 54-year-old. She waved off the widespread concerns about the party’s policies that target Muslims, citing how she, a practising Muslim, had learned to balance her fate with France’s secularism.Her French husband, however, was vehemently opposed to the party’s hardline stance on immigrants. “He tells me: ‘If migrants are here, it’s because they don’t have any other choice,’” she said, citing those who live on the streets. “And he says if they’re in that situation, it’s because they’ve lost everything.”Sunday’s first-round ballot, in which 9.4 million other French voters voted along the same lines as Vermorel, saw the far right emerge as the frontrunner, raising the temperature in an already high-stakes election. More than 200 candidates have since withdrawn from the race in an effort to build a united “republican front” capable of preventing the RN from taking power.InteractiveWhether it will succeed or not is unclear; only after this Sunday’s second, decisive ballot will France know for sure. In the meantime Vermorel had come to the market in the hope that whipping up a few of her husband’s favourite dishes might quell some of the tension. “As we’re not seeing eye to eye, I thought maybe if he eats better, he’ll remember that I cook well,” she said, with a nervous laugh.While the “republican front” strategy has long been a mainstay of French politics, and a poll on Wednesday suggested it may yet deprive Marine Le Pen of a majority, there’s no guarantee this time around that the “block” on the far right will work. For it to do so, it will require centrist voters to back candidates from the far-left France Unbowed (LFI), and leftwing voters to line up behind candidates from Macron’s centrist alliance.“The choice we have is either black or white,” said one 40-year-old who declined to give her name, citing her position as a public servant. “And now we’re all talking about it. What should we do? What’s the least bad option? I think that’s the real question.”Among the first candidates to withdraw from the race was Sarah Tanzilli, a member of parliament with Macron’s Renaissance party since 2022 and centrist candidate in the constituency that includes Meyzieu. Earlier this week, even as the extent to which the president’s centrist alliance would employ tactical alliances to block the RN remained unclear, she was clear on what she had to do. “It was the only decision possible,” she said.The ambiguity over whether Macron’s centrist candidates would drop out had been owed partly to their messaging during the campaign, as Macron sought to argue that France was facing the risk of “civil war” if either of his “extreme” opponents won a majority.Tanzilli was swift to note that there were still elements of France Unbowed, whose leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon has faced accusations of antisemitism, that rattled her. “The big difference is that there is no risk that France Unbowed will have an absolute majority in the National Assembly.”The same could not be said for the RN, she added. “The far right stands for the opposite of liberty, equality and fraternity. So it’s extremely dangerous for our country, extremely dangerous for our ability to live together.”Tanzilli, whose family’s roots stretch generations back to Armenia, pointed to the RN’s promise to scrap nationality rights for children born and raised in France by foreign parents as an example. “If these rights hadn’t existed when my grandparents and great-grandparents arrived in France, I wouldn’t be French.”On Wednesday, even as the centrist alliance said that 90% of its candidates had quit three-way races if they were in third place and had an RN candidate ahead of them, it remained to be seen whether centrist voters would fall into line, said Ikrame Saidi, one of a handful of volunteers crisscrossing the market in Meyzieu, handing out flyers for the local France Unbowed candidate. Victor Prandt trailed the RN in the first round by 10%.“It’s complicated,” said Saidi. “Several people who voted for Macron’s centrists tell us they don’t want to vote for the New Popular Front.”Brian, 28 and a fellow volunteer, chimed in: “They’re telling us that they don’t vote for extremes. So for them, there’s an equals sign between what they consider the extreme left and the extreme right.”Many centrists argue the radical-left France Unbowed, which believes traditional parties no longer serve democracy, does not share “republican values”.But Brian said he saw that depiction of the party as an extension of a strategy employed by Macron since 2017, discrediting those on the left while also relying on them as a bulwark against the far right. “But there’s no equivalence to be drawn between a party that proposes nothing but racism and parties that, even if they don’t agree among themselves, have come up with a project to give people back their dignity and improve their lives.”As rain began to drizzle over the market in Mayzieu, several people said they weren’t planning on voting. “It breaks my heart to see the bad guys,” said Làhsene Hadbe, born in France to parents with Algerian roots, pointing to the RN. “They’re extremists, racists, fascists and I hate them.”But the sentiment wasn’t enough to move him to cast a ballot in Sunday’s election; he said he had given up hope on electoral politics in the early 1990s. “Nope,” he said. With a laugh, he added: “I would be ready to physically fight against them but not to vote against them. It’s bizarre, no?”Others, such as Valérie Sodoyer, said she would be casting a blank vote so as not to have to make a choice. “None of them suit me,” she said.Since arriving from Tunisia five decades ago, Saida Khlifi said she had steadily watched as the welfare state deteriorated, leaving herself and others struggling as the cost of living soared.The situation had left her unenthused about the forthcoming election. “It’s neither here nor there,” she said. “I don’t have any confidence in anyone.”Even so, she was determined to vote on Sunday. “To say no to Le Pen,” she said. She pointed to the party’s origin as the National Front, whose racist, antisemitic and anti-Muslim views had long been seen as a danger to democracy.The party had put forward few ideas, she said, and had instead targeted migrants who had worked and paid taxes their whole lives, such as herself. “If already, with the others, we’re not living well, do you think that when the [RN] takes power, we’ll be able to live better?”"
HuffPost UK,Rishi Sunak And Keir Starmer In Final Plea For Votes As Country Goes To The Polls,[],Kevin Schofield,3 July 2024 at 11:32 pm·3-min read,3,July,2024,11:32:00,3,"Either Keir Starmer or Rishi Sunak will be PM this time tomorrow. Getty ImagesKeir Starmer and Rishi Sunak have made a final plea for votes as polls opened on election day across the UK.Millions of voters have until 10pm to decide whether the Labour leader becomes prime minister or whether the Tory chief will pull off a major shock and remain in No.10.The final opinion polls of the six week-long campaign all indicated that Labour is heading for a historic victory, with the Tories slumping to their worst ever performance.But in his final message to the country before polls opened at 7am this morning, Sunak once again urged voters not to hand Labour a “supermajority”.He said: “The reality is simple. If the polls are to be believed the country could wake up tomorrow to a Labour supermajority ready to wield their unchecked power, put up everyone’s taxes and leave the UK vulnerable to the threats we face at home and abroad.“They will do lasting damage to our country and our economy – just like they did the last time they were in power. Don’t let that happen.“I know how frustrated people are. The last few years have been extremely difficult, but the answer is not to usher in a Labour government with licence to tax you and your family to the hilt, run amok with your hard-earned money and change the rules to lock them in power for a generation.“You have the power, you have a voice, you have a vote – use it to stop Starmer, to stop a Labour supermajority and their slew of taxes. Mark my words, they are coming for your pension, your home, your car. You name it, Labour will tax it.“Your vote matters, Vote Conservative today.”Starmer, however, said the election was a chance for Britain to begin “a new age of hope and opportunity after fourteen years of chaos and decline”.He said: “The choice today is clear, between a changed Labour Party that stands ready to restore politics to service and rebuild Britain, or a Tory party that crashed our economy, left public services in ruin, and now wants to give us Liz Truss 2.0 with more unfunded spending promises.“We cannot afford five more years under the Conservatives. But change will only happen if you vote Labour.”Meanwhile, voters are being urged not to forget their photographic ID when they go to the polling station.It is the first general election in which the controversial new rules will apply across the UK.Craig Westwood, director of communications at the Electoral Commission, said: “Before heading to the polling station, check to make sure that you have the ID you need to vote. It needs to be an original version, copies and pictures won’t be accepted.“If you don’t remember your ID when you arrive at a polling station, you can return with it later in the day. Anyone in a queue at 10pm will be able to cast their vote.”Related...Tories Heading For 'Worst Election Result In Their History', New Poll RevealsTories On Course For Election Disaster As Labour Head For 1997-Style Win, New Poll SaysTories Heading For Electoral Wipeout As New Poll Predicts 250-Seat Labour Majority"

The Guardian,Polling stations open across UK for general election,[],Eleni Courea Political correspondent,3 July 2024 at 11:36 pm·4-min read,3,July,2024,11:36:00,4,"Voters are going to the polls across the UK in a general election that is expected to deliver the first Labour government in 14 years.Polling stations in 650 constituencies across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland opened at 7am on Thursday. Counting will begin immediately afterwards, with the results announced in the early hours of Friday morning.Writing on X as the polls opened, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said: “Change. Today, you can vote for it.” Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, posted a series of messages on the same site that urged voters to “stop the Labour supermajority”.The Lib Dems tweeted: “This election is our chance to win the change our country desperately needs.” The SNP tweeted: “VoteSNP to deliver independence, rejoin the EU, scrap the two-child benefit cap, invest in the just transition, protect free tuition.”The contest closes six weeks of campaigning by the prime minister and the leader of the opposition. It follows a period in which the UK has had three Conservative prime ministers in nearly five years.defaultIt is the first election to take place in July since 1945, after Sunak took the country by surprise six weeks ago and called a summer poll.Labour is seeking election on a platform of change, and has promised to create a new publicly owned energy company, nationalise the railways, cut net migration, recruit 6,500 teachers and create more than 100,000 new nursery places.The Conservatives have promised to introduce compulsory national service for 18-year-olds, introduce an annual cap on migrant visas, recruit 8,000 police officers and cut a further 2p off national insurance with a view to abolishing it.Senior Tories including one of Sunak’s closest cabinet allies were effectively conceding defeat on Wednesday. Starmer accused the Conservatives of trying to suppress voter turnout by presenting the election result as a done deal.Labour has maintained its 20-point lead in opinion polls for the entirety of the election campaign and is hoping to make huge gains across England, Wales and Scotland. A YouGov poll published on Wednesday night said Starmer’s party was on track to win its largest majority in modern history.It would mark an unprecedented turnaround from the last election, held in December 2019, when Boris Johnson defeated Jeremy Corbyn to win an 80-seat majority for the Conservatives. His campaign was centred around the promise to “get Brexit done”.Less than three months into his premiership, Johnson had to contend with the Covid-19 pandemic. He resigned in July 2022 after losing the confidence of his MPs due to a string of scandals including Partygate and the handling of internal misconduct allegations.Johnson was succeeded by Liz Truss in September 2022, but her disastrous premiership lasted only 45 days. She was forced to resign after presenting a mini-budget that lost the confidence of the markets and caused the value of the pound to plummet to a historic low.Sunak, who was defeated by Truss in the 2022 Conservative leadership contest, took over but has failed to turn the Conservatives’ fortunes around.Starmer has been in office since April 2020 and has brought about a dramatic and ruthless transformation of his party during that time. He suspended Corbyn, in whose shadow cabinet he served, who is seeking election as an independent candidate in Islington North.Several of the smaller parties – the Liberal Democrats, Greens and Reform UK – are projected to perform well in this election.Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, has fronted a stunt-driven campaign that polls say is due to deliver dozens of seats in Conservative strongholds. The Liberal Democrats have pledged to introduce free personal care in England, give everyone the right to see their GP within seven days and ban sewage discharges into rivers and seas.The Greens are targeting disaffected leftwing voters in four seats including Bristol Central, which is being defended by the shadow culture secretary, Thangam Debbonaire. Their policies include a wealth tax on assets of more than £10m and bringing railways, water companies and the big five energy firms into public ownership.Reform UK is projected to win up to three seats, despite uproar about several of its candidates’ and activists’ racist and misogynistic remarks. Pollsters say Nigel Farage is likely to enter parliament on his eighth attempt with a victory in Clacton-on-Sea. His party wants to freeze immigration – except for those with essential skills – and end policies designed to reach net zero.A total of 650 MPs will be chosen under the first-past-the-post system, where the candidate who secures the most votes in each seat is elected. To win an overall majority, a political party must win more than half of these seats: at least 326.All British citizens aged 18 or over are eligible to vote, as are citizens of Commonwealth countries and Ireland who are resident in the UK. Voters must have registered to vote in advance and must take a valid form of voter ID to the polling station."

Over the last four elections the survey has forecasted the size of the eventual majority with almost perfect accuracy.At that moment, we will get the first proper preview of how the next Parliament could look like for at least the next four years.Throughout the day we will be updating seat by seat until we have a clear picture of the full results.Polling day in pictures09:02 , Maryam Zakir-HussainRishi Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty leave after voting at a polling station (EPA)First Minister of Scotland, John Swinney, arrives to vote with SNP Candidate Dave Doogan and son Matthew (Getty Images)Actor Charles Dance queues to vote at a polling station in Kentish Town (Getty Images)Pictured: Game of Thrones actor Charles Dance queues to vote in Kentish Town09:02 , Salma OuaguiraActor Charles Dance queues to vote at a polling station in Kentish Town prior to the arrival of Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, on July 4, 2024 in London (Getty Images)What is voter ID and which forms of identification can I use to vote in the General Election?09:00 , Salma OuaguiraThere are many different forms of ID that will be accepted at the polling station.

In the here and now, damagingly high inflation has returned to just above the Bank of England’s target of 2%, giving the Prime Minister the opportunity to say the economy is on the right track.However, as Labour is keen to point out, the long period of unusually high inflation has long-term consequences, with lower rates simply adding less to high household costs.The state of the nation’s finances is a key element that both the main parties always claim they can be trusted on, with the Conservative Party historically regarded by voters as the more reliable on tax and spending decisions.But with most notably the turmoil caused by Liz Truss’s mini-budget in 2022, the party faces an uphill struggle to re-establish this reputation.The latest figures show the UK’s overall national debt was £2.69 trillion in April, or 97.9% of gross domestic product, and 2.5 percentage points more than at the end of April 2023.Where do all the party manifestos stand on key policy areas?08:40 , Salma OuaguiraWhere do all the party manifestos stand on key policy areas?Nigel Farage urges people to ‘vote with your heart'08:36 , Salma OuaguiraPolls are now open.

Mr Farage condemned the comments.

Today, you can vote for it.”After voting in his constituency, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak posted a message on the same site, formerly known as Twitter, which urged voters to “stop the Labour supermajority”.Green Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay, also writing on X, said: “Today’s the opportunity to vote for real hope and real change, in #WaveneyValley, and across the country.”Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, posted an image asking people to “vote with your heart”, adding: “Vote for real change today. Vote Reform UK.”The SNP tweeted: “#VoteSNP to deliver independence, rejoin the EU, scrap the two-child benefit cap, invest in the just transition, protect free tuition.” (AFP via Getty Images)UK General Election night: Everything to watch out for once the polls close08:20 , Salma OuaguiraElection night starts the moment voting ends, with the exit poll at 10pm. At the last general election, in December 2019, the exit poll overestimated the Conservatives’ win by three seats. It underestimated them by four seats in 2017, and by 15 seats in 2015. In 2005 and in 2010, the exit poll got the number of the leading party’s seats exactly right, first Labour and then the Conservatives, John Rentoul writes.The size of Labour’s predicted majority will be compared instantly with the historical benchmarks: Tony Blair, 179 (1997); Stanley Baldwin, 209 (1924); David Lloyd George, 239 (1918); Stanley Baldwin, 243 (1935); Ramsay MacDonald, 493 (1931).Then, there is a wait of about an hour and a half for the first declaration. At this point, the sensible thing to do would be to take a power nap – but everyone will discuss the exit poll on social media instead.The first seat to declare will this time be a race between the new Northumberland constituency of Blyth and Ashington, and Houghton and Sunderland South in Tyne and Wear. Blyth is aiming to declare around 11.30pm. It produced a significant early Conservative win in 2019, but the constituency has since been redrawn, and the new seat would have been Labour last time, so it won’t count as a Labour gain if Ian Lavery, previously the MP for Wansbeck, wins it.Sunderland South had a long run as the first seat to declare, from 1992 to 2015, but was beaten by Newcastle upon Tyne Central in 2017 and 2019. It will hope to have declared within minutes of Blyth; for its part, Newcastle upon Tyne Central now has “and West” added to it, and isn’t expected to declare until 1.15am.The main thing to look out for in the first two results is the swing from Conservative to Labour. The opinion polls currently suggest a 16 per cent swing since the last election, the equivalent of Labour up 16 points and the Tories down 16. The exit poll will provide a first estimate, but these will be the first “real votes in real ballot boxes” to test it against.

This would far exceed the defeat faced by John Major in 1997, when the number of Conservative seats fell to 165.

From taking selfies to telling others about how you voted, here’s everything you need to know.You must vote at the polling station to which you have been assigned between 7am and 10pm today. If you are in a queue when the polls shut, you are still allowed to vote.When you arrive, you will receive a ballot paper listing candidates and their respective parties in your constituency. You will have to take it to a screened booth where you will find a pencil to vote with. But you can use your one pen if you prefer.If you make a mistake, you can ask for another ballot paper if you have not put it in the ballot box. Votes made with a tick or even a smiley face can be counted if the choice is clear, but if counting staff cannot read the ballot, it will be disqualified.What can and can’t you do inside a polling station?The Electoral Commission advises against taking a selfie inside polling stations as it can risk accidentally giving away how someone else voted, which is against the law. But people are welcome to share pictures taken outside, even one with their dog. But you are not allowed to take pictures of the ballot paper you receive in a polling station, but you can photograph your postal ballot paper.People can tell others how they voted, but only about their choice and not anyone else’s. The fine for revealing how another person voted is up to £5,000 or six months in prison.However, people with a disability can have a presiding officer, a close family member aged 18 or over or an eligible voter to mark the paper for them. People with a visual impairment can ask for a device that allows them to mark their own ballot paper. A large print version is usually available at polling stations.Hundreds of misleading claims repeated on social media06:58 , Jane DaltonAnalysis conducted by Full Fact of Facebook posts by 1,540 parliamentary candidates from all parties has found more than 300 repeats of misleading claims:Fact check: Hundreds of misleading claims repeated on social mediaHow to vote in the General Election: From finding a polling station to filling out your ballot06:50 , Shweta SharmaVoters in the UK will visit polling stations up and down the country on July 4 to have their say in which political party they want to represent their area and country.Prime minister Rishi Sunak announced the snap general election at the end of May, sparking six frantic weeks of political campaigning.

The programme will continue to refute any claims that we - or the production company we worked with - knew or paid the Reform UK canvasser, Mr Andrew Parker.“We met Mr Parker for the first time at Reform UK’s campaign headquarters in Clacton, and he was filmed secretly via the undercover investigation.”If Boris Johnson is the Tories’ secret weapon, it’s a sign of how desperate they are05:00 , Jane DaltonBoris is the Tories’ secret weapon?

Voters without the correct ID could apply for a free voter authority certificate.If ID is lost or stolen after the deadline, voters in England, Scotland, and Wales can apply for an emergency proxy vote until 17.00 on polling day, allowing another registered voter to vote on their behalf.Many voters have already cast their votes by post.

You name it, Labour will tax it. Your vote matters, vote Conservative today,” he said.Labour leader Sir Keir said the UK “cannot afford” five more years under the Conservatives, adding Britain can “begin a new chapter” under his party.“The choice today is clear.

Or a Tory party that crashed our economy, left public services in ruin, and now wants to give us Liz Truss 2.0 with more unfunded spending promises,” he said.

I do draw inspiration.“But just as every time - you may have noticed a football theme to the campaign - every time we have come out the tunnel onto the pitch, this is a boyhood dream.”Farage faithful chant ‘we want our country back'Wednesday 3 July 2024 20:32 , Jane DaltonNigel Farage led crowds in a chant of “we want our country back” as he said the election was the “tip of the iceberg” for Reform.The crowd booed when the Reform UK leader referenced Rishi Sunak, referring to him as “slippery Rishi”.He said the Conservatives had promised lower taxes and reduced immigration in the last four manifestos, “so why the hell should we believe them on the fifth?”He added: “For all of us that voted Brexit, for everybody that helped (the Conservatives) win that 80-seat majority under Boris Johnson in 2019 they have betrayed our trust and they deserve to lose the election.”Lib Dem leader optimistic over ousting ToriesWednesday 3 July 2024 20:20 , Jane DaltonLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, who drove off in a pink cadillac convertible with his deputy Daisy Cooper after his last election campaign stop, said “it looks really good for us” in the fight to oust Tories in the “blue wall”, with Labour and Green supporters prepared to vote tactically.He also said the Tories’ decision to bring Boris Johnson into their campaign was “a bit weird”.“I think the Conservatives’ desperate tactics are a bit weird, reminding people of the failures - the failures of Boris Johnson, the failures of Liz Truss, of Rishi Sunak,” he said.

He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""This is one poll - we’ve actually, I think, had four other polls published in the last 24 hours - none of which have had Reform ahead, not even all of which have had Reform gaining ground, but quite a couple of them certainly suggesting it’s also got very close.""He said it may not be the case that Reform are ahead - and could be on average four or five points behind.

The only way Rishi Sunak can hope to get even to base camp in narrowing the lead that Labour have started off with this campaign was to squeeze the Reform vote.""He added: ""Rather than making progress, things are actually going backwards, not least of course because of Nigel Farage’s decision to fight this campaign.""With many speculating that Reform UK with Farage at the helm could ""beat"" the Tories, Yahoo News UK takes a look.What do the latest polls say?YouGov’s voting intention tracker, updated on Tuesday, suggests the Tories and Reform UK are neck and neck.With Labour well ahead on 38%, the Tories are trailing on 18% – compared to a high of 53% under Boris Johnson in 2020 – with Reform UK just behind on 17% and the Liberal Democrats on 15%.However, there are multiple polls taking place at any one time by a number of different companies.According to the PA news agency, an average of all polls that were carried out wholly or partly during the seven days to June 13 puts Labour on 43%, 21 points ahead of the Conservatives on 22%, followed by Reform on 14%, the Lib Dems on 10% and the Greens on 6%.And while Reform’s average is up one percentage point on the figure for the previous week and the Tories are down one point, there is still an eight-point gap, on average, between the two.Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?Unless something remarkable happens, in short: 'No' - and that's because of the first past the post (FPTP) voting system in which the candidate with the largest number of votes in their constituency is elected.According to the Electoral Reform Society, which is against FPTP, this system leads to a situation where “even if millions of voters support the same party, if they are thinly spread out across the UK they may only get the largest number of votes in a couple of these contests – so only win a few MPs"".“Tens of thousands of voters supporting a different party, but who live near each other, could end up with more MPs. This means the number of MPs a party has in parliament rarely matches their popularity with the public.”Rishi Sunak on the campaign trail on Wednesday. (AFP via Getty Images)Farage knows this well. As the leader of UKIP in the 2015 election, he saw his party win 12.6% of the nationwide vote and one seat. The Liberal Democrats won 7.9% of the vote... and eight seats.Indeed, YouGov last week released a poll – put together using the multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) surveying technique, from a sample size of nearly 60,000 respondents – which suggested the Tories would win just 140 seats, having won 365 in 2019. But this is still 140 more than the zero it projected Reform UK to win, in spite of its strong polling figures.The model had Reform UK ""performing strongly in a number of seats but still a long way off winning in any"", with projected second-placed finishes in 27 constituencies.YouGov's MRP projection. (YouGov)Granted, this model was formed between 24 May and 1 June, before Farage's headline-grabbing intervention on Monday last week in which he announced he would be standing as an MP.But, even as Reform UK polls closer than ever to the Tories, it's difficult to imagine the party winning more than a handful of seats.Chris Hopkins, director at polling firm Savanta, told Yahoo News UK that in one respect, Reform UK is at an advantage compared to Ukip in 2015 because ""Ukip took votes from both Labour and the Conservatives, and we are not seeing that with Reform UK – they are all coming from the Conservatives.""That is the consequence of Rishi Sunak making immigration a centrepiece of the campaign and failing to deliver on it. Even if you have voters that are neutral on immigration, they would say the small boats policy has been a disaster.""But even so, Hopkins said, Reform UK is still ""at a huge electoral disadvantage"" in that its votes are not very concentrated, they are very evenly spread.""There are going to be some races where Reform UK is strong - the Nigel Farage factor in Clacton is really interesting - but realistically its ceiling is five seats: and that’s a high ceiling.""Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey on a campaign visit in Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire, on Wednesday. (PA)Like Reform UK, Sir Ed Davey’s Liberal Democrats are performing well in the polls.In a sign of how defensive the Tory campaign is becoming, one online party advert claims voting for Reform UK or the Lib Dems could give Labour 100 extra seats, resulting in the biggest majority in its history.It depicts a scenario where the Conservatives are beaten into third place behind the Lib Dems, with just 57 seats, despite getting 19% of the vote and without Reform winning a single seat.Read more: Pollsters got it wrong in 2015, so could Labour’s lead be overestimated? (The Guardian)However, it remains unlikely the Lib Dems will finish second. YouGov’s MRP poll projected the party performing strongly, winning 48 seats. This would be up 37 from 2019, but still nowhere near the Tories’ projected 140.However, amid all this talk about projections, it’s worth remembering they are still only polls and not a definite indicator of how people will vote on 4 July. The 1992 and 2015 elections are notable examples of how polling didn’t match the end results of Tory wins.What is proportional representation?Proportional representation, as defined by the UK parliament, is an electoral system ""in which the distribution of seats corresponds closely with the proportion of the total votes cast for each party. For example, if a party gained 40% of the total votes, a perfectly proportional system would allow them to gain 40% of the seats.""This differs from the first past the post system, as set out above, in that a relatively high vote share rarely corresponds with increased seats for the smaller parties. In 2019, for example, the Lib Dems won 11.5% of the vote but only 1.7% – 11 – of the 650 seats.Unsurprisingly, both Reform UK and the Lib Dems support proportional representation.The Lib Dems this week made it part of their manifesto, with the party saying it would introduce the single transferrable vote method, a form of proportional representation which allows electors to rank their preference of candidates on the ballot.The party previously sought to change the UK’s voting system while in the coalition government under then-leader Nick Clegg, but voters rejected the plan in a 2011 referendum.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

Yahoo News UK,Who is Keir Starmer? Son of a toolmaker who grew up to become a 'Sir'What you need to know about the personal life of the man who wants to be the UK’s next prime minister,"['His early life', 'His family', 'His parents', 'His education', 'Why is he a Sir?']",Hannah Fearn,Updated 1 July 2024 at 4:47 am·4-min read,1,July,2024,04:47:00,4,"The son of a toolmaker and the first of his family to go to university, Sir Keir Starmer is the most working class Labour Party leader in a generation.Yet when focus groups are asked what they think his favourite drink is, they guess that he’s partial to a gin and tonic rather than a pint down the local boozer. Many also assume his title is hereditary.Here's what you need to know about the personal life of the man who wants to be the UK’s next prime minister.His early lifeStarmer was born in Southwark, south London, in 1962, as the second of four children. His parents were Labour Party members and named him after Keir Hardie, the party’s first leader in parliament.The family moved out of the capital and he grew up in Hurst Green, a village just outside the small Surrey town of Oxted. He was active in youth politics from his teenage years but was also a skilled musician, taking music lessons alongside Norman Cook, who later became better known as a member of The Housemartins and the DJ Fatboy Slim.Starmer played the flute, piano, violin and recorder and was a junior exhibitioner at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.His familyStarmer with his wife, Lady Victoria Starmer, at the Labour Party Conference in October 2023. (Alamy)Starmer is married to Victoria, a former solicitor who later retrained in occupational health and now works for the NHS. The pair met through their work in the law in the early 2000s and married in Essex in 2007.She was first seen accompanying her husband when the couple were filmed clapping for carers during the pandemic in 2020 outside their home in Camden. They have two children, a son and daughter, but both are kept out of the public eye.Victoria's father was Jewish and originally came from Poland, while her mother converted when they got married. Starmer has said in a previous interview that ""my wife in particular wants our children to know the faith of her family"" and that they ""observe some of the practices, for example Friday night prayers"".His parentsKeir Starmer with parents, Rodney and Josephine, at his graduation. (Twitter/Keir Starmer)The Labour leader's father, Rodney Starmer, worked as a toolmaker in a factory, and his mother Josephine Starmer (née Baker), was a nurse.His father worked 14-hour days but spent his time outside work caring for Josephine, who was diagnosed with the autoimmune condition Still’s disease. She required two hip and knee replacements twice in her lifetime and struggled with arthritic pain.As a young man Starmer also helped care for his mother, which he has said led to him being more emotionally reserved. His sister, Katy, recalled: “He’s had to be a grown-up all his life. I’ve always been quite open about my feelings – Keir is good at most things, but not that.” Josephine Starmer died in 2015, and his father three years later.His educationA photograph of a younger Starmer as shown on ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories in 2021. (ITV)Starmer passed the 11-plus examination, and attended Reigate Grammar School from age 11. While he was at the school it became an independent fee-paying institution, but as an existing student he was exempt from fees, and his tuition in the sixth form was covered by a bursary.After school he studied law at the University of Leeds, this first in his family to attend university, graduating with a first class degree in 1985. He undertook postgraduate law studied at the University of Oxford, where he served as editor of a radical magazine, Socialist Alternatives.Why is he a Sir?Keir Starmer pictured in 2010, when he was director of public prosecutions, making a statement about MPs who face charges over their expenses claims. (Getty)Starmer was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 2014 in recognition of his work in the legal profession, culminating in a five-year term as director of public prosecutions (DPP).He first became a barrister in 1987 at the Middle Temple, later joining Doughty Street Chambers and was appointed a Queen’s counsel in 2002, aged just 39. In 2008 he was appointed head of the Crown Prosecution Service and DPP.During his tenure he chose to prosecute three Labour MPs and a Conservative in the wake of the parliamentary expenses scandal, and was responsible for prosecuting former MP Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce for perverting the course of justice after Pryce claimed responsibility for her former husband’s speeding offence."
Yahoo News UK,"Who is Richard Tice? Reform’s former leader turned Farage sidekickThe candidate for Hartlepool has seen his party's popularity swell in recent months, with one poll showing reform ahead of the Conservatives.",[],Andrew Naughtie,Updated 14 June 2024 at 3:45 am·6-min read,14,June,2024,03:45:00,6,"Now that Nigel Farage has taken over as the leader of Reform UK, Richard Tice’s public profile is fading fast - but the Reform chairman remains involved in the party's operations.So far, the party has only one MP, Conservative defector Lee Anderson. But a recent poll has shown Reform overtaking the Tories, raising the possibility Anderson could hold his seat and even end up with fellow Reformers in the next Parliament.As the candidate for Hartlepool, where he stood as the Brexit Party candidate in 2019, Tice hopes to be one of them. So who is he, and what does he stand for?Childhood and educationBorn in Surrey in 1964 to James Tice, a showjumper, and Joan Tice, a horse trainer. Educated at the private boarding school Uppingham, he studied at the University of Salford, gaining a degree in construction economics and quantity surveying – teeing him up for a career that he said would ""continue the family genes in the property industry"".Family (partner & kids)Tice has three children from a 24-year marriage that ended in divorce. He is now in a long-term relationship with the right-wing writer and journalist Isabel Oakeshott.She is perhaps best known for two notorious incidents that set her against leading Tories: a book that featured the heavily disputed allegation that David Cameron had engaged in sexual activity with a pig, and the release of embarrassing messages entrusted to her by Matt Hancock when she agreed to write a book with him.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election? Full list mappedThe key issues that will decide the electionWhen is the first UK general election TV debate?What is purdah? The strict rule that governs what politicians can and can't sayNet worthWhile not quite in the same league as Rishi Sunak, Tice is one of the wealthiest people in British politics. As he describes it on his website, he made his multi-million-pound fortune over the course of “30 years of making things happen in property investment”, starting with a graduate job at a London firm in 1987.According to Tice, the company he leads as CEO, Quidnet Capital, has “bought and managed £500 million in commercial properties across the UK on behalf of clients”.He was also a key figure in the redevelopment of London’s Nine Elms district, near Battersea Power Station, a controversial project that has transformed a stretch of the Thames’s south bank with a welter of rapidly erected high-rise blocks.GB News linksAlong with Nigel Farage, Lee Anderson and several MPs on the right flank of the Tory party, Tice is a regular on the hard-right, culture war-focused TV outlet GB News. There he hosts a programme called “Richard Tice’s Sunday Sermon”, which serves as a platform for him to deliver his political analysis without the interruptions of an interviewer.However, despite the network being a relatively safe space for him in ideological terms, Tice’s appearances aren’t always amicable. A recent interview with host Andrew Pierce, a longtime right-wing commentator, saw him challenged fiercely about Reform’s chances in a summer election should one be called – with Pierce pointing to the “weirdos” selected by the party to fight numerous seats as evidence the party is “not ready”.Richard Tice, pictured in 2018 at a 'Leave Means Leave' campaign event, is focused on the issue of immigration. (Steve Finn/WENN)Tice was also involved in an incident that saw the network deemed in breach of broadcasting regulator Ofcom’s impartiality regulations, specifically an interview in which a former Brexit Party MEP failed to “sufficiently challenge” his views on immigration.The regulator is under increasing pressure to crack down on GB News heading into the election, with critics arguing it cannot be allowed to broadcast shows that feature Tory and Reform MPs interviewing each other without alternative points of view represented.Tice on NHSThe state and future of the NHS set to be one of this election’s main battlegrounds, and Reform’s key health policy is to spend £17 billion on the NHS on top of its current budget in an effort to get waiting lists down to zero. It also proposes introducing tax relief on private healthcare – something that has been criticised by opponents as a creeping step towards the privatisation of healthcare writ large.Tice’s stated rationale is that the reason the service is struggling is because the money it needs is being spent on other things that the public do not in fact support. Top of the list is Net Zero, which the party and its predecessors have long decried as a pointless “woke” project.In April, Tice used a press conference to frame the choice starkly. “We have a choice in this country, it seems to me,” he said. “A pretty clear choice. Do we want zero waiting lists in two years, and to keep them there? That is the Reform choice. Or do we want net zero CO2 emissions in 25 years? That is the Labour choice.”Tice on immigrationImmigration is by far Reform UK’s top issue, with the party looking to build on Farage’s two decades of campaigning against it in its legal and illegal forms.As far as the election goes, Tice and the party are targeting the continuing arrival of small boats of people travelling across the English Channel, many of them seeking asylum. He has criticised the government for failing to stop “mass immigration” post-Brexit, and described Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda policy as “a disaster”, arguing on GB News that its supposed deterrent value was revealed to be zero just hours after the House of Commons finally passed the law.Reform chairman Richard Tice (L) and leader Nigel Farage speak at the party's economic policy launch at Church House in London. (Alamy Live News)“Within a matter of hours more boats, absolutely packed full, overfilled with illegal migrants, were setting off from the beaches. And we learnt on Tuesday morning that sadly five people, including a young child, drowned leaving the beaches. That's not a deterrent. That's an absolute disaster.”Instead of deporting people to Rwanda, he is arguing for a “pick up and take back” policy that would see small boat arrivals deposited back on French soil. As evidence that this is both practical and humane, he has cited similar policies deployed in the US and Australia.However, he has not addressed the fact that Australia’s policy has been criticised internationally for leaving so-called “boat people” confined to facilities on the island of Nauru, where there have been incidents of suicide and self-immolation.Tice on cost of living crisisPerhaps unsurprisingly given he is trying to peel away former Tory voters, Tice has criticised recent Tory prime ministers harshly for overseeing Britain’s intense cost of living crisis. In 2022, he accused then-prime minister Boris Johnson of “waffling” over the situation. “Clueless, out of touch, no ideas, no help,” he tweeted. “Shocking.”He has also warned that the prospect of a “disastrous” Labour government will offer no prospect of meaningful relief for struggling households.Instead, Reform proposes lifting the minimum level of income tax to £20,000 while cutting various other taxes – among them fuel duty, another gesture to the party’s rejection of environmentalism as a top priority."
The Guardian,UK will be mostly dry for polling day – but strong gusts forecast for Scotland,[],Jamie Grierson,3 July 2024 at 4:46 am·2-min read,3,July,2024,04:46:00,2,"The general election campaign opened with a sodden prime minister standing before the door to No 10 Downing Street, rain pooling on the shoulders of his suit.In contrast, polling day on Thursday is likely to be dry for most of the UK with only occasional showers in the north of England, some heavier in Scotland.Scotland could feel quite blustery, with strong winds of up to 40mph (64km/h) inland and 50mph on the coast forecast.Records suggest turnout is not generally affected by weather conditions. According to the UK parliament’s website, despite the general election in 2019 being the wettest since records began in 1931, turnout was higher (67.3%) than in 2001 (59.4%) and 2005 (61.4%), when polling day fell in June and May respectively.Paul Gundersen, the chief meteorologist at the Met Office, said: “Strong winds are expected on Thursday, with Scotland bearing the brunt. Inland areas in Scotland could see gusts of 30-40 miles per hour, while coastal areas and hills could experience gales with gusts of 40-50 miles per hour.“Along with that wind, the west and north-west of Scotland will also see blustery showers, which will perhaps merge into longer spells of rain later. A few showers are also likely across Northern Ireland, Wales and northern England but southern England should remain dry with sunny spells.“It will feel cooler in the damp north-west but temperatures will be nearer average in the south and south-west. That rain is expected to continue in parts of Scotland and perhaps Northern Ireland overnight.”defaultTemperatures of about 18C (64F) and sunny spells are expected in Cardiff, Liverpool will have highs of 17C accompanied by sunshine and showers, while Edinburgh and Manchester will have sunny spells and showers with temperatures at about 18C.It will be nowhere near as warm as the election in June 1970, when there was a surprise victory for the Conservatives under Edward Heath, as England, Wales and Scotland reached 28.3C, 27.8C and 26.9C respectively."
