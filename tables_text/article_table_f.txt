54,"First Minister John Swinney has said The SNP will include a social tariff on energy, broadband and mobile bills in its manifesto this week.The proposal will see those on low incomes, with disabilities and the elderly pay less on their bills, with the party suggesting they be cut in half.Mr Swinney unveiled the plan today ahead of the SNP manifesto being published on Wednesday.READ NEXT: Scottish Liberal Democrats pledge to boost wages in General Election manifesto(Image: Gordon Terris)The proposal would be funded by a mixture of general taxation and “an obligation” from profits of energy companies, with the party claiming the cost would be about £7.8 billion for the present year.The First Minister said that his party want to update entitlements “for the 21st century”.He said: “This community is wrestling with some of the highest levels of fuel poverty in our country, it is literally unbearable for people, despite the fact that this community is producing vast amounts of renewable energy.""“At the heart of our manifesto will be that commitment, that we will argue for a social tariff funded by general taxation and by the power companies which will reduce the costs for those who are vulnerable in our society and give them a material contribution to reducing the cost of living.“Today, none of us really can operate without connectivity, access to broadband, access to telecoms, so many public services are delivered by that mechanism as well.“So we’re going to propose that the social tariff extends also to broadband and telecoms costs, so that people are liberated of the excessive burden and they’re able to access public services and their wider communication in society, because they have got a tariff that is appropriate for meeting their circumstances.”READ NEXT: Glasgow West: Partick to Drumchapel the battle for votesAndrew Bartlett, the chief executive of Advice Direct Scotland, welcomed the commitment.He said: “It is encouraging to see the need for a social energy tariff moving up the political agenda with just over two weeks until voters go to the polls,” he said.“We believe it is the best way of fixing the UK’s broken energy market.“In the wake of a winter which has once again seen millions of people struggling to afford to heat their homes, it is time for concrete action.”But the Scottish Tory finance spokeswoman, Liz Smith, said: “The SNP have hiked taxes on ordinary Scots to the highest levels anywhere in the United Kingdom and it seems like they just want to keep driving them higher and higher.“Everybody wants to see lower energy bills but the way to do that is not to make hardworking Scots pay more and hammer the North Sea oil and gas industry, which would put jobs at risk.“This proposal for a half-priced tariff is a half-baked idea that might sound good on paper but, in reality, it would just see Scots paying even more in tax and do huge damage to our economy.”It comes after the Scottish Liberal Democrats launched their manifesto today.The party's manifesto included plans to introduce a carer’s minimum wage with a £2 an hour boost, as well as fast-tracking access to mental health counsellors in schools.The party also said that an additional £1b in capital funding would come to Scotland through Barnett consequential which could be used to tackle the housing emergency and local health facilities across the country.",SNP to include social tariff on energy and broadband in General Election manifesto,7,1
164,"Reform UK insists its plans are “not just another party manifesto”, because it does not expect to win the election. But there are a lot of policy ideas in its 28-page “contract” with the electorate. Here are the main proposals from Nigel Farage’s party.Economy and taxation• In short: Liz Truss on steroids. There would be cuts to personal tax worth £70bn a year, including scrapping income tax below £20,000, and big cuts to stamp duty and inheritance tax. Cuts to business levies including corporation tax would cost £18bn a year.• Reform says this would be paid for by scrapping plans to reach net zero carbon emissions (more on that below), plus £50bn a year from cutting government departments and quangos, and £35bn from the technical process of making the Bank of England stop paying interest on commercial bank deposits created through quantitative easing.• All this could be filed under “fiscally bold”. The Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank termed the package “problematic”, saying: “Even with the extremely optimistic assumptions about how much economic growth would increase, the sums in this manifesto do not add up.”Immigration• There is only so much room to the right of the Conservatives on this subject, but Reform would use most of it, pledging a freeze on “non-essential” immigration, with only a handful of exceptions, and higher national insurance imposed on overseas workers.• On asylum seekers, Reform would take Britain out of the European convention on human rights (ECHR), process people offshore and “pick up illegal migrants out of boats and take them back to France”.• On small boat crossings, there would be significant doubts about whether, even outside the ECHR, the UK could actually return asylum seekers to France. And a freeze on immigration, even with limited exceptions for the NHS, could have a significant impact on the social care and hospitality sectors.Environment and energy• A major part of Reform’s offer is to roll back green targets, including to scrap net zero goals altogether, which the party says would save £30bn a year over 25 years. The International Energy Agency estimated that the UK spent less than £9bn a year between 2021 and 2023 on low-carbon energy policy. This is less than comparable developed countries, and, according to an LSE study, higher green investment is likely to lower household bills and boost growth more than tax cuts.• The manifesto says net zero has increased bills, damaged industries such as steelmaking, and made the UK less energy secure. However, evidence from the IMF shows energy bills have risen because of the UK’s heavy reliance on imported gas.• In terms of threats to security, the World Economic Forum put extreme weather as the leading global risk to security in 2024.Healthcare• As part of the tax cuts, frontline NHS and social care staff would pay zero basic-rate tax for three years, with the aim of boosting staff numbers. There would also be 20% tax relief on private health insurance.• While Farage has called for a move away from the current NHS funding system towards one that also uses social insurance, this idea is not set out in the document. It is fair to say that the health and care plans as they stand are fairly broad.Policing and crime• As well as promising 40,000 more police officers, the party has pledged mass stop and search, and the end of what it terms “woke policing”.• The sentencing regime would be significantly toughened, with mandatory life sentences for anyone convicted of drug dealing, or a second violent or serious offence. And 10,000 new prisons places would be built.• Given that about 10,000 people a year are convicted for drug dealing alone, such policies would need a lot more prison places. Also, there is limited evidence that non-intelligence-led stop and search is effective in curbing crime – or that police forces would want to use it.Education• This section is low on specifics and seems to be led more by culture war issues, with the first two points calling for a “patriotic curriculum” and an end to “transgender ideology” in schools. There would be another tax cut, this one offering tax relief on private school fees.• On universities, as well as scrapping interest on student loans – this does not seem to appear in the costings section – the party would push for two-year degrees, and cut funding to universities it felt were denying free speech.Housing and transport• On housing, Reform says it wants to “unleash” housebuilding, but the party would also protect landlords, scrapping plans to ban no-fault evictions or other renting changes.• On transport, the party would end the “war on drivers”, unilaterally scrapping any clean air zones, low-traffic neighbourhoods and almost all 20mph zones.• These sorts of policies give a flavour of the type of voter Reform wants to attract: older people who are more likely to be homeowners and drivers.Other policies• Social security: “motivate” people to work, and withdraw all benefits if they turn down two job offers.• Brexit: abandon the Windsor framework, which sought to find a compromise over EU trade and not having a hard Irish border.• Constitution and voting: replace the Lords with an elected second chamber; move towards a proportional voting system.• Culture: scrap the BBC licence fee and the Equality Act; make St George’s and St David’s days public holidays.","Do Reform UK’s election claims on tax, immigration and environment add up?",7,8
390,"“If you want politics as pantomime,” Sir Keir Starmer said at his party’s manifesto launch last week, “I hear Clacton is nice this time of year.”The Labour leader’s remarks were a not-so-subtle barb at Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, who has launched his return to politics in the Essex seat.But Jovan Owusu-Nepaul, Labour’s candidate, will be hoping he can convince voters in the seat to call curtains on Mr Farage’s eighth attempt to become an MP.A recent poll by Electoral Calculus suggests Mr Farage is likely to win the constituency relatively comfortably, securing 39 per cent of the vote.Labour candidate Jovan Owusu-Nepaul pictured with Reform leader Nigel Farage (Martin Suker)Labour is meanwhile projected to come second with 28 per cent and the party is telling locals that Mr Owusu-Nepaul is the only one who can keep Mr Farage out - calling on voters to cast their ballots tactically.Mr Owusu-Nepaul went to school in Southampton, attending the Warwash Maritime School at Solent University, which specialises in training for those considering working in the maritime industry.He went on to study politics, philosophy and economics at Goldsmiths University in south-east London, graduating with a 2:1 and a distinction in his dissertation, which was a comparative analysis of the political economy of the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn, against the party under the leadership of Tony Blair.He also studied at the University of Cambridge, achieving a master of studies (MSt) in history before throwing himself into politics.During his studies, he served as chair of the Lewisham Deptford Constituency Labour Party and was the first British African/Indo-Caribbean ever to hold the position, and was also one of the youngest Labour chairs at the time.His selection as Labour’s candidate in Clacton was officially confirmed by the party in May.Polls project Mr Farage will win the seat in Clacton for Reform UK (Reuters)A press release described the prospective MP, an active trade unionist and campaigner, as a “young man with a passion for revitalising the constituency and a desire for change”.Mr Owusu-Nepaul said it had been “the honour of my life” to be selected as Labour’s candidate in Clacton, adding: “I know we can mount a campaign to give us a fighting chance of winning the next election and give residents in places like Clacton, Frinton, Walton-on-the-Naze and the surrounding villages a stronger voice in Westminster.”The Conservative Party has held Clacton since 2017, when Giles Watling secured a majority of 15,828.Douglas Carwell won the seat from the Tories in a 2014 by-election after he defected from the party to stand for UKIP, Mr Farage’s old party.According to the Electoral Calculus projection, the Conservatives are on course to secure 25 per cent of the vote, with the Liberal Democrats on 4.4 per cent, the Greens on 2.4 per cent and other parties on 1.2 per cent.But the Best for Britain campaign group claims its analysis shows Labour can still come through the middle to win the seat if Green and Lib Dem voters back the party.The claim came as part of a wider tactical voting analysis by the group published this morning for 451 seats across the UK, including a plan to unseat prime minister Rishi Sunak, his chancellor Jeremy Hunt and predecessor Liz Truss.Best for Britain’s chief executive Naomi Smith said her group hoped to provide a roadmap for the four in 10 voters looking at voting tactically for centre-left parties and wanting to minimise the number of Tory seats, as well as preventing “nativist, populist parties” like Farage’s Reform UK getting a foothold in parliament.She said previous votes in the area showed there was strong Labour support in Harwich, part of the Clacton seat, which “was suppressed by Brexit”. But Harwich had been held by Labour in 1997 and 2001.She said: “Our analysis shows that if the Greens and Lib Dems vote Labour then Labour can come through the middle and win Clacton.”",Who is Jovan Owusu-Nepaul?

242,"Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting has urged voters not to give “matches back to the arsonist to finish the job”, as he suggested a Conservative election victory would be a “nightmare on Downing Street”.The Labour frontbencher warned against “breathtaking complacency” over opinion polls predicting a victory for Sir Keir Starmer’s party at the General Election.Polls have continued to heap pressure on Rishi Sunak and underline why the Tories have shifted strategy to warn would-be Reform UK voters not to risk handing Labour a landslide win.Cabinet minister Mark Harper insisted the Conservatives are “fighting to win this election” as he repeated the Prime Minister’s warning that a vote for Nigel Farage’s Reform UK would give Labour “a very large majority” and a “blank cheque” in office.It came after analysis and modelling by Survation put Labour on course for a 262-seat majority with the Tories reduced to a rump of just 72 MPs and Reform potentially picking up seven seats.Mr Streeting told Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips on Sky News: “I just warn people, against this backdrop of breathtaking complacency in the media about the opinion polls, do not give the matches back to the arsonist to finish the job.”NEW: First MRP Since Farage’s return.Labour on course for 262 seat majority.LAB 456CON 72LD 56SNP 37RFM 7PC 2GRN 142,269 interviews conducted online and on the phoneFwk 31 May – 13 JuneConducted on behalf of @BestForBritain.@VasilSurvation and @JackSurvation…— Survation. (@Survation) June 15, 2024He added: “Do people want to see Liz Truss’s mini-budget on steroids, which is the Conservative manifesto, being delivered if there’s a nightmare on Downing Street on July 5, or do they want to see a stable economy with economic growth, shared prosperity, enable us to invest in our public services without clobbering working people with taxes? That’s the choice at this election.”Mr Harper told the same programme it it not “wise” to regard the election result as a foregone conclusion.But, he continued: “The polls do tell us one thing – they do show people that if people don’t vote Conservative and some of the smaller people vote for the smaller parties and Labour does end up with a very large majority, they’re going to have a blank cheque, they’re trying very hard in this campaign not to spell out how they’re going to pay for any of their promises.”Transport Secretary Mark Harper said the Conservatives are ‘fighting for every vote’ (Victoria Jones/PA)The Transport Secretary went on to repeat the much-disputed Tory claim that a Labour government would increase taxes by £2,000, as the bitter clash over tax and spending plans continues.The Conservatives have produced a list of 17 potential tax increases Labour could make, but Sir Keir’s party said it would refuse to be drawn into the Tory trap of responding to each claim.Mr Streeting declined to rule out council tax rises or re-evaluations.When pressed on this on the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg, he evaded the question and repeated the party’s line: “We don’t want to see the tax burden on working people increase.“None of those pledges in our manifesto requires increases in council tax or increases in fuel duty or any of the other number of taxes the Tories are claiming we want to increase.”Mr Streeting suggested there could be greater spending increases for the NHS than committed to in the Labour manifesto, saying this could happen “only if the conditions allow”.The Conservatives seized on this, with a party spokesman saying: “Labour’s manifesto is just window dressing for the election campaign and they are planning to spend and tax more than they are telling the public.”(PA Graphics)It followed analysis by the Nuffield Trust think tank that suggested both Labour and Tory pledges on the NHS would leave the health service with lower annual funding increases – at 1.1% and 0.9% respectively – than during the austerity era.Scotland’s First Minister John Swinney said: “Scotland has already suffered the consequences of 14 years of Tory cuts, Brexit, and a cost-of-living crisis – the last thing our NHS needs now is even more cuts, Brexit and creeping privatisation imposed by Sir Keir Starmer’s incoming Westminster government.“Independent experts are clear the Labour Party is planning around £18 billion of cuts to public services – and will starve the NHS of the cash it needs to improve health and care services.”",Streeting warns against complacency and giving ‘matches back to the arsonist’,6,4
72,"If 2019 was the Brexit election, 2024 is the tax election.The Tories and Labour have repeatedly clashed over each other’s tax plans, with chancellor Jeremy Hunt claiming on Sunday that Sir Keir Starmer would turn the UK into a “taxtopia”.Labour has hit back by accusing the Tories - way behind in the polls - of being “desperate” and having “massive holes” in their own plans.But the Tory focus on tax continued after Starmer ruled out imposing capital gains tax on the sale of family homes. The Conservatives are now demanding he rules out a series of other potential tax measures they claim would be needed to fill a “£38.5bn black hole” in Labour’s plans.But amid all the sniping, how does a government actually spend each pound it takes from us in tax? And what have experts said about the Tory and Labour tax pledges set out in their manifestos this week? Here, Yahoo News UK explains.What are the headline tax pledges?On Tuesday, Rishi Sunak unveiled a manifesto containing a £17.2bn package of tax cuts, including a further 2p cut to national insurance for employees. This will build on similar successive 2p cuts at the autumn statement and spring budget.For the self-employed, the main rate of national insurance would be abolished by the end of the next parliament.The manifesto also promises no increases to income tax, national insurance or VAT. And the Tories have pledged to scrap capital gains tax for landlords who sell properties to their tenants.Rishi Sunak launches the Conservative election manifesto at the Silverstone race track on Tuesday. (Getty Images)Meanwhile, economic stability was Labour’s pitch to voters in its manifesto released on Thursday, with a pledge to cap corporation tax at its current rate of 25% to give businesses long-term certainty.Along with this, Labour has ruled out raising the rates of income tax, national insurance and VAT. It has also committed to charging VAT on private school fees, abolishing the non-dom tax status and closing “loopholes” in the windfall tax on oil and gas companies.In total, Labour plans to raise more than £7bn in revenue from tax, its costings document said.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer launches the party's election manifesto in Manchester on Thursday. (Getty Images)What have experts said about these pledges?Leading think tank director Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said he was sceptical about the Tory manifesto’s costings.“The Conservatives have promised some £17bn per year of tax cuts and a big hike in defence spending,” he said. “That is supposedly funded by reducing the projected welfare bill by £12bn; cracking down on tax avoidance and evasion; and saving billions from cutting civil service numbers, reducing spending on management consultants and ‘quango efficiencies’.“Those are definite giveaways paid for by uncertain, unspecific and apparently victimless savings. Forgive a degree of scepticism.”On the Labour manifesto, Johnson said the tax outlook was equally uncertain: “Yes, [economic] growth could surprise on the upside - and if it does, then the fiscal arithmetic would be easier. But if it doesn’t - and it hasn’t tended to in recent years - then either we will get those cuts, or the fiscal targets will be fudged, or taxes will rise.”So how does the government spend our taxes?First of all, it should be pointed out that the following breakdowns are based on government figures last updated in January: prior to the most recent budget in March. However, they still give a good indication of where taxpayers' money goes.This first chart shows how much is spent comparatively on different sectors.So, almost half of our taxes - 40% - is spent on health (20%) and welfare (20%) alone. When we consider some of the numbers and factors behind these key sectors, we can gain an understanding of why so much is spent on them.For example, under health spending, the NHS has a gigantic workforce of around 1.7 million people: making it one of the biggest employers in the world - and the biggest in Europe. Around two-thirds of its budget goes on headcount.Funding of the NHS is broadly split into two areas: day-to-day running costs, which accounts for the vast majority of spending, and infrastructure. The health service sees around 1.3 million patients every day.And it's not going to get any smaller - acccording to the NHS Long Term Workforce Plan, the projected demand for staff by 2036/37 will be in the region of 2.4 million people.Welfare, meanwhile, is defined by the government as ""social protection"". This includes spending on numerous areas such as unemployment benefits, tax credits, public sector pensions... as well as benefits or support covering categories such as old age, sickness and disability, housing, children and families.Universal credit is expected to account for 27% of total welfare spending in 2023-24.A further 40% of our taxes is spent on national debt interest (12%), state pensions (10%), education (10%) and business and industry (8%).This second chart, meanwhile, shows the total amounts spent on the same areas as above.We are paying more tax than everAccording to an IFS report this week, tax revenue as a share of national income was 36% and rising earlier this month, “the highest tax burden since 1948”.""The parliament that started in 2019 saw the biggest rise in the tax take of any parliament in modern history,"" it said.Taxes as a share of GDP. (OBR)The Office for Budget Responsibility, meanwhile, has previously forecasted (see chart, above) tax will represent 37.1% of GDP by 2028–29. This would be just below the all-time high of 37.2% in 1948.However, the IFS also pointed out the tax burden ""is not high compared with most western European countries"".In 2021, the most recent year for internationally comparable data, UK tax revenue was 33.5% of GDP, compared to an average 39.9% of GDP among the EU14 countries - those in the EU before 2004 - including France and Germany.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

50,"England in training the day after the win over Serbia - PA/Adam DavyBy Ben Rumsby in FrankfurtRishi Sunak has called on England fans to avoid singing ‘10 German Bombers’ at the European Championship in Germany, with the Prime Minister instead suggesting they embrace the song that could take their campaign by storm.Videos emerged of England supporters singing the offensive chant in both Gelsenkirchen - where the team beat Serbia 1-0 - and in Dusseldorf ahead of the Group C opener, with several seen carrying inflatable spitfires in reference to German casualties in the Second World War.England manager Gareth Southgate has previously called for fans to avoid singing the chant and those pleas were echoed by the Prime Minister on Monday, with Mr Sunak urging Three Lions supporters in Germany to instead throw their energies behind the Hey Jude anthem that echoed around the Veltins-Arena on Sunday night.“It’s great to see England get our Euros campaign off to a winning start, the whole country is behind them to go all the way,” Mr Sunak said.“And when it comes to the chants specifically, I agree [with] what Gareth Southgate has said about that chant in the past, and what we want is to represent the best of our country at these tournaments.“And that means more goals for Jude Bellingham and more singing of Hey Jude.”03:27 PM BSTTwo more games leftOnce the Romania vs Ukraine game is done in Munich, there are still two more matches to enjoy.

It’s very important to start a tournament with a win and that was our main aim. We definitely didn’t want to lose the game, but we knew had the quality of players to win the game and we proved that.It was a very difficult game and we had to earn it, but those are the ones which feel even better. Tournament football is really hard and of course we feel we could’ve played better, but we won and in tournament football that’s the only thing that matters to be honest.We’ll keep up the momentum. It’s the first game so we won’t get ahead of ourselves. We know we earnt today, but at the same time we know we need to improve in the tournament. So there’s things to learn and things we can also look at and be happy with.On being deployed in midfield:It’s physically demanding but when you’re playing with the likes of Declan [Rice], Jude [Bellingham] and the others in and around you with an experienced back four behind you, it helps.With Declan and Jude talking to you and guiding you through it, it’s hard to go wrong. The manager and the staff, Steve Holland especially, we’ve put a lot of work into this role.So I was well prepared and I knew what was asked of me and what role I needed to do and hopefully they felt like I executed it because we got the win in the end.TAA started in midfield last night alongside Declan Rice - Getty Images03:00 PM BSTTeam guide: FranceWho is the star player? If his rating was not high enough before, then scoring a hat-trick in the World Cup final proved Kylian Mbappe’s credentials as a bonafide superstar. If France win the tournament, Mbappe will be the reason for it.How do they play? Similarly to England, France swap between a 4-2-3-1 and a 4-3-3 formation with Mbappe deployed on the left wing and Antoine Griezmann in the number 10. With Paul Pogba banned and N’Golo Kante ageing, their midfield now relies on Aurelien Tchouameni and Eduardo Camavinga.Chances of victoryFrance go into the tournament among the favourites. However, England await in the semi-finals should both win their group and many are backing Southgate’s team to gain revenge on their Qatar World Cup defeat. Semi-finals.02:51 PM BSTTeam guide: AustriaWho is the star player? David Alaba’s ACL injury means Austria will be without their star player and captain so the focus will fall on Marcel Sabitzer, who now plays his trade for Dortmund after a brief spell at Manchester United.How do they play? Austria have always attempted to play quick one and two-touch football, but under Ralf Rangnick, it is stressed more so than before. Like at Manchester United, Austria are fluid with their formations under the 65-year-old. They fielded a 4-3-3, 4-1-4-1 and a 4-4-2 line-up in qualifying.Chances of victoryWith their leader and star player ruled out and the toughness of the group, Austria’s chances of making it out the group are slim, even in third place, unless Rangnick can master a miracle. Group stages.02:46 PM BSTTeam guide: SlovakiaWho is the star player? Milan Skriniar. The 29-year-old has long been Slovakia’s best player since Marek Hamsik retired. The PSG centre-back can do a good job of marshalling their defence but will fall short in attack.How do they play? Francesco Calzona sets his side up in a 4-3-3 formation with full-backs going forward to make up for the lack of wingers in his squad. Skriniar runs a tight ship in defence after conceding just eight goals in qualifying.Chances of victoryTheir defensive capabilities should see them make a run for second place in the group, however, their lack of firepower going forward could see them come up short. Instead they will progress via the best third-placed teams route. Round of 16.02:37 PM BSTTeam guide: BelgiumFor the two games to come later today, let us take a closer look at the four teams we will see, starting with Belgium:Who is the star player? At 32, Kevin De Bruyne’s appearances at a major tournament are numbered. With his minutes managed at Manchester City after a long injury the summer may come just in time for him to be fit and firing once more.How do they play? Like many top teams with a good midfield, Belgium prize themselves on a possession-based approach usually in a 4-3-3 formation. Jeremy Doku provides the pace which Romelu Lukaku lacks with Amadou Onana holding firm in midfield.Chances of victoryBeing on what looks like to be the open side of the draw, Belgium could coast their way to the quarter-finals if they find form. Getting past that will be a tough ask, but the Golden Generation have one last dance. Quarter-finals.02:31 PM BSTGoal in MunichWOW! WOW! You need to see this goal from Romania.

Positionally sound, calm. Tonight was an even bigger test because stature-wise he’s not one of the biggest centre-backs and there was going to be a lot of aerial balls in the box.He dealt with that really well, so, yeah, I thought he transferred what he does with his club on to the biggest stage and he showed what a good player he is.01:50 PM BSTThe thoughts of Kieran TrippierOn getting a win in the first game:It’s always massive. You look across the past few tournaments that we’ve had, it is always crucial to get the first win. We knew it would be a tough game, a tough team to play against and we had to defend our box very well, and I thought we did that.We’ve learned a lot, but the most important thing is the three points. It gives us great momentum, belief. It shows the character of the boys. When it gets tough, you know you have to deal with that.The subs that came on made a huge impact and that’s what we’ve always talked about - the togetherness of the group, everyone has to be ready. You can be called upon at any moment and the subs were a great impact for us.On England’s next game against Denmark:We’re not thinking about a point. We want to go into the Denmark game and we want to win. That’s our only focus. We don’t want to focus on anything else further than that.We know Denmark are a very good side, good quality players, so now the most important thing is we recover as a team and then we focus on Denmark.Kieran Trippier started at left-back against Serbia last night - Richard Sellers/Getty ImagesOn the importance of a clean sheet:Clean sheets are massive. As you look through the winners of tournaments, clean sheets are a massive factor. We talk about that lot, defend our box well and certainly we had to defend crosses because they put some dangerous balls in the box.If you look at the last tournament as well, I think we had the most clean sheets and that can take you far. The most important thing is don’t concede and you see the quality that we have got at the other end to score goals.On Jude Bellingham:You don’t need to be at my age to be a leader. You can be 18, 19, 20. You can lead in different ways.Jude is so young but he leads. Like I said, you don’t need to be an experienced player, you don’t need to be Harry Kane who is the captain, you can lead in any way at any age. We’ve got that in our squad. The new players coming into our squad have done extremely well, they speak up and we have made them feel very welcome.01:36 PM BSTCompetition debut for MainooA special moment for one of our own ✨#MUFC || #EURO2024 pic.twitter.com/5XqgbN00Wo— Manchester United (@ManUtd) June 17, 202401:30 PM BSTScotland defender Grant Hanley speaking to the media this afternoonOn their heavy defeat to Germany:Obviously we’ve had a couple of days. We’ve put [the Germany defeat] to bed. The manager had a couple of meetings last night to go over it and draw a line under it and look forward to the next game.As players we have got to look at ourselves first and look how we approach the game and perform. This is a group [of players] that’s been together for quite a while now. We’ve had our ups and downs together, we’ve shown before we can bounce back from negative results.On responding to critics: I don’t think we need to send a message to critics. Certainly for Scotland supporters, we feel that disappointment as well.I think supporters see it is a genuine side who want to give their all for the country. We have got a massive opportunity to be successful again.On if nerves played a factor in their opening defeat by Germany: These games are huge, a big occasion and everyone wants to play on those types of nights. So obviously there is a bit of added nerves in the atmosphere around the game.But no I don’t think that’s something we can use as an excuse as to why we didn’t perform like we wanted to on Friday.

Romania or Ukraine? - Chris Ricco/Getty Images12:22 PM BSTYour opinions on England’s win last nightPeter McMahon: “Bellingham was the only one in the side who appeared as if you wanted to move forward. Unfortunately, every time he passed to someone and ran into space, that person passed the ball backwards. In addition, they were unable to play out from the back, even in the most basic manner, and relied on long kicks from Pickford. The only consolation is that they were still exponentially better than Scotland.”Julian Hughes: “England looked really sound. In the last Euro final they looked skilful but a bit innocent and done over by a much more cynical and hard headed Italian team. This time they looked a bit more mature, less volatile, really focused on their own performance and not about to be surprised by fate.”Sean Browner: “We’ve seen this film before and know how it will end. Yes, Foden should have been hooked for Palmer at h/t. I’d also have got Watkins on for Kane to run the channels and stretch Serbia. Kane held the ball up well and took a battering but he hadn’t got the pace to threaten now.”12:16 PM BSTSetting new records20 - Jude Bellingham is the first European player to make an appearance at three major international tournaments before turning 21 (aged 20 years, 353 days today), having played at EURO 2020, the 2022 FIFA World Cup and now EURO 2024.

I think you see in Madrid every week, seen it again (against Serbia), the match winner.I feel like he’s a player that when I’m holding I’ve just got to let him flourish and do his thing, let him feel like he’s got the confidence on the pitch to go out there and do whatever he wants.The more we play together, I feel like the connection and bond we’ve got is really, really good. With Jude, he is just another level isn’t he? That is all I can say really.On Trent Alexander-Arnold:Trent I thought played really well. (It was) his first time properly playing like a defensive midfield role. So it’s a really good trio.On the victory in their opening game:It’s massive. I think we’ve built this team off clean sheets. In the last Euros, I think we had five out of seven and at the World Cup we had a lot of clean sheets. We have real defensive solidity, it’s just about doing it on the night...it was definitely a game of two halves.It was a really important victory, to be honest with you, to kick-start the tournament. I thought we started really well, showed some real great composure with the ball. It’s always tough against a back-five and second half they obviously came on to us a lot more and were probably a bit more of a threat.But in the end, I thought we were comfortable - we’ve just got to use the ball a little bit better in the second half when it starts to get tough.🙌 @_DeclanRice 🙌 pic.twitter.com/s8zlQ0j1Dy— England (@England) June 17, 202411:07 AM BSTThe thoughts of Jude Bellingham after the gameI think the first half shows why we can score goals against any team, and the second half shows why we can keep a clean sheet against any team. I think obviously, commonly with the team, there’s a negative theme around all our games. You know, sometimes rightly so.But I think in this case you take the positives from the fact that, OK, maybe we had to hold on at times and suffer a little bit, but we kept a clean sheet. When you keep clean sheet all you have to do is score one goal to win the game.It’s three points, I think this team is still so new, gelling together with every game. I think inside the changing room we’ll be happy with that. Of course, there will be negatives that we want to kind of rub out but overall I’m pleased with that performance.On Trent Alexander-Arnold:I loved it. I think we had a great balance with the ball, without the ball, particularly in possession I thought Trent was brilliant. He conducts games so well. He’s very calm on the ball. His technique and qualities unmatched, I think, in terms of what he can do with the ball.He’s always positive and that really helps someone like me who wants to get on the ball all over the pitch and try and attack their backline. So, I look forward to having more minutes with him, enjoying how we can develop and how we can get used to each other’s game, and seeing how far we can take the potential.And of course, as always, Declan [Rice] was fantastic. I think he’s one of the best in the world in that position. He’s a joy.11:04 AM BSTGareth Southgate’s post-match thoughtsThat’s the reality of tournaments, they’re a strong team and we had to suffer a bit but that’s good for us.[Jude] writes his own scripts doesn’t he? The timing of his runs. It was a super bit of play in the build-up of his goal. I think all of our forward players looked really good.[Disappointed not to score more goals?] Today was just the finishing and a good save from the keeper from the header. I’m confident we will score goals. It’s not easy to play against a back five but we created chances.I said I’m glad we suffered a bit without the ball [because it will stand England in good stead down the line]. I think is really good for us. I think to defend the box the way we did was really good for us. I was really pleased with a lot of the play. Second half we didn’t keep it as well as I would have liked but to get the win is very important.Jude goes forward a lot and Trent adapted to his positioning really well, used the ball well and had a good effort on goal.10:59 AM BST‘Wolf’ goal celebration explainedCelebrations are always a hot topic of discussion and last night was no different. After Jude Bellingham scored England’s winning goal, he and Alexander-Arnold pulled out an interesting celebration and it has now been explained. Will it catch on? You will probably see all the young kids this week in parks using that celebration.Will this catch on? - Ozan Kose/Getty Images10:50 AM BSTYour reactionJohn Bates: “This result shows exactly the problem with Southgate. In the first half England were good - though why Kane was there who knows and Bellingham had to come and get the ball because they were too slow getting it to him, but the second half was abysmal. If Southgate thinks you can defend a one nil lead for 45 minutes against the likes of Spain, France, Germany or Italy he is delusional. The trouble is the win will flatter him.”Lord Balfour: “Nothing has changed with England, very slow attacking movements, panic in defence and very poor substitutions. Cole Palmer one of the best attacking midfielders and a leading goal scorer, sat on the bench. Southgate has always been clueless and England will be lucky to reach the quarter finals. Just like every other tournament but this time with some of the most talented players.”Bettina Thwaite: “It was a stressful game to watch, especially the second half. Serbia always looked on the verge of scoring. Faced with a better team England will cut a sorry figure. I was trying to discover without success what their game plan was. Their passing especially in the second half was fractured and over excited. They should have calmed down.”Duncan Macdonald: “Sorry but much as I hope they do well I just think Southgate is the most negative thing about the team. It’s all about safety first and protecting the lead once they get it. Sitting on a one goal lead for 70 minutes or 60 if you’re being generous is never going to work against the top teams. He has been found out because of this defensive mindset in two consecutive Championships and unless they are far more positive going forward it looks like he same will happen again. It’s a great shame because England have the makings of a great team but not the manager to capitalise on them.”10:44 AM BSTMbappé not embraced in France?France get their Euro 2024 campaign going this evening against Austria in Düsseldorf.

International football is more “tactical” but games are still there to be won. Despite the ridiculously fawning half-time “analysis” England didn’t create much in the first half. And what a struggle in the second!”Donald Troosers: “You have the pick of the nations players and can put whatever player you want in the position that they are perfect for and have played in all season. So why is Trippier playing on the left when he’s a right footed player? And Foden didn’t seem to know where he was supposed to be! Was Southgate trying to trick the opposition? Didn’t really work....”The West is going west: “They needed someone to come on and set the game alight like Grealish did against Bosnia. Having bored us to death with the Serbia game, maybe Southgate’s cunning plan is to bring such a player on for the next game.”Colin Wolstenholme: “Personally, I think the Foden question has been answered. He is a totally different player for England than he is for Man City, and nowhere near as effective. If anyone can explain the difference I would love to know, but on the last few performances, is he worth a place?”Robert Jeans: “Negative and sloppy. This team could and should have overwhelmed Serbia and won 4 or 5- nil. Sitting back was the risky option. Failure to get players into the box when there are good scoring opportunities, is fairly unforgivable and there was some really poor passing. Had Serbia sneaked an equaliser, it would have surprised nobody.”Stephen Nix: “It was a win and a clean sheet. Yes they were all over them for the first 20 or so minutes and after that a bit careless at times, but they got the job done. Learn from it, tighten up and go on. It’s a results game, we are not drawing pictures.”09:51 AM BSTJude’s complete performanceEngland’s winning goal came from the head of Jude Bellingham, who is coming off the back of a stellar debut season at Real Madrid where he won the La Liga title and the Champions League.

Bellingham is the real deal. Glad that Kane nearly scored as well. There were a few squeaky-bum moments from the opposition. One goal is not enough to be comfortable.”Andrew Marchant: “Man of the match for England was Pickford by a country mile. Not only did he have to deal with constant back passing by England’s defenders and midfield but at one point he was the only England player facing the Serbian goal. Perhaps Southgate needs a compass to work out where the oppositions half is.”Singapore Sling: “We were lucky. Should have put fresh legs on sooner during the second half. Also surprised Gordon wasn’t played.”Steve Murphy: “Bellingham is such a complete midfielder and leader that he almost makes Foden dispensable unless Foden can get out of the spaces that Bellingham runs into and use his intelligence to play off Bellingham then the unthinkable will have to happen and we leave him on the bench, that is how good Bellingham is and Foden needs to realize it quickly.”Jason Hobson: “Dreadful performance against a poor opposition. Southgate seems to have a unique ability to take talented players and make them looks useless by playing them out of position.”You can continue to have your say.09:31 AM BSTAgree with Matt Law’s assessment?FT view: That was tougher than England would have liked, but they got over the line and there was plenty to be pleased about.

general Jonathan Ashworth put a copy of the Tory manifesto into a shredder, claiming that is what Mr Hunt had done to the Conservatives’ economic credibility.He said: “This newsletter, which Mr Hunt released to his constituents in recent days, totally shreds the Tory manifesto and totally shreds any remaining credibility on tax and spend the Tories once had.”A Conservative Party spokesman said: “Unless action is taken, the working-age welfare bill will rise by more than £20 billion a year by the end of the decade.“Labour is in complete denial about this and don’t think it’s possible to save a single penny from this unsustainable rise.“We don’t think that’s right, which is why have set out how we would save £12 billion from the welfare bill by the end of the next parliament, including by controlling spending on health and disability benefits and taking people’s benefits away after 12 months if they don’t accept a job.“Keir Starmer’s refusal to even think about tackling this problem would mean one thing: higher taxes.”Shadow paymaster general Jonathan Ashworth shreds a copy of the Conservative manifesto (James Manning/PA Wire)Labour wants a new Brexit deal – here’s why business

solution. We need radical, fresh thinking, we haven’t had it for years in this country. We are getting poorer.He added: “Britain is broken, we’re presenting some radical ideas for how we can change that.”Asked why his party has faced repeated controversies with former candidates engaging with right-wing groups on social media, Mr Farage said: “How you define extreme of course is very difficult and we can find many people in the Labour Party and call them extreme left.“Look, we’ve had some problems, the Greens have had even bigger problems than I’ve had.

It’s work from home, pop into Whitehall a couple of days a week.”He added: “If you’re running a company and things are tight, you say to your managers and middle managers, ‘Right, I’m sorry, this is the way it is, you’ve got to cut £5 in £100’ – in fact in tough times it might be £10 in £100 or £20 in £100, and you have to find a way of doing that without affecting the product that we’re selling to the public.”Mr Farage added: “Some of these things we’re proposing are tough but, look, the accumulated national debt is now £2.7 trillion, it was just under £1 trillion when the Tories came to power, we simply cannot go on like this.Farage said the UK is ‘skint’ and in ‘real trouble’ (REUTERS)Suella Braverman’s new ‘cringey’ TikTok election video is actually real14:40 , Holly EvansSuella Braverman’s new TikTok video described as “cringey” has left many viewers confused about whether it is just a parody.The former home secretary was filmed doing a swaggering dance to the soundtrack of Fedde Le Grand and Ida Corr’s 2006 hit ‘Let Me Think About It’.She launched the new account on the social media platform last week with a handful of videos as part of her general election campaign, and it has already received tens of thousands of views.Read the full article here:Suella Braverman’s new ‘cringey’ TikTok election video is actually realTaxPayers' Alliance (TPA) endorses Reform UK’s contract14:35 , David MaddoxMore bad news for Rishi Sunak after centre right think tank the TaxPayers’ Alliance (TPA) endorsed Nigel Farage and Reform UK’s contract with the people.The TPA played a major role in getting the Tories back to power in 2010 by questioning the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown government tax and spend policies and has been staffed by former Tory aides.But as Mr Farage unveiled Reform’s manifesto - or contract - for voters, the TPA put out a statement giving it their support.The TPA said: “Reform’s package of tax cuts, spending controls, and reducing regulation has the potential to offer real relief to Brits struggling under a record high tax burden and give a boost to businesses drowning in red tape.”However, it noted that while the plans for tax are big on promise, the details for reining in spending need to be spelt out for sceptical taxpayers.“Nigel Farage knows how to stand out from the crowd. But for this to be the radical rethink he wants, taxpayers will expect detailed and deliverable proposals on which quangos will be scrapped and which spending programmes will be cut.”Reports Sunak is urged to ‘go for the jugular’ shows Tory desperation, Starmer says14:27 , Holly EvansSir Keir Starmer said that reports Rishi Sunak is being urged “go for the jugular” and launch more direct personal attacks against him for his campaign show that the Tories are “desperate”.The Times reported that Cabinet ministers and senior Tories are urging the Prime Minister to launch “personalised attacks” on Sir Keir over his support for Jeremy Corbyn, his decision to campaign for a second referendum on Brexit and his work as a human rights lawyer.Sir Keir told reporters: “That’s all they’ve got left after 14 desperate years. You get to to the last weeks and their only thing they’ve got left is to attack me personally, I think that tells you everything.”“If they had a record to stand on, they would go into the final two weeks saying these are the brilliant things we’ve done but they haven’t got a record to stand on and if they said they’d done brilliantly people would laugh at them.”He added: “This is desperate.”Sir Keir Starmer told reporters that the Tories were getting ‘desperate’ (REUTERS)Nigel Farage says Reform UK 'not pretending we are going win this election'14:16 , Holly EvansLabour peer Michael Cashman has whip removed after Rosie Duffield comments14:16 , Holly EvansLabour Peer Michael Cashman has had the whip removed after comments he made that Rosie Duffield was “frit or lazy” for calling off local hustings over safety concerns.Sir Keir Starmer told reporters that what Lord Cashman said was “particularly inappropriate and that’s why the support of the whip was withdrawn as it was very swiftly”.Ms Duffield, a Labour General Election candidate who has been a defender of women’s rights and female-only spaces, said her attendance at local hustings was “impossible” because of “constant trolling”.The former EastEnders actor and Labour MEP commented on a social media post about Ms Duffield’s move: “Frit.

It is not what you are going to get from the current Labour and Conservative parties who are virtually indistinguishable, frankly, from each other.”He stressed again that his fight is about “who the opposition is going to be”, as he believes Labour will be in Number 10 in July.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage holding his party’s ‘contract’ with voters (Ben Birchall/PA) (PA Wire)Sunak insists Tories are ‘on the right track’ despite Shapps admitting defeat is likely13:57 , Holly EvansRishi Sunak insisted the Conservatives are “on the right track”, despite his Defence Secretary Grant Shapps admitting earlier today that a Tory victory at the General Election is unlikely.Speaking from Centrica’s Rough 47-3B gas rig, the Prime Minister said: “There’s still two-and-a-half weeks to go in this election, I’m fighting hard for every vote because I believe we can win.“And there’s a very clear choice at this election: it’s having your taxes cut by the Conservatives or facing significant tax rises with the Labour Party.”Asked if he understands people’s frustrations with the Tory party with some deciding to turn to Reform UK, he replied: “Of course I understand people’s frustrations with that, I mean that’s undeniable, and I’ve been very clear that we have made progress but there is more to go.Farage rubbishes Tories plan for national service13:48 , Holly EvansSpeaking in south Wales, Nigel Farage rubbished the Conservatives’ plans for national service, saying: “What we ought to be doing is saying, look, there were 100,000 people in the army in 2010, there are 72,000 people in the army now, let’s not recruit 30,000 part-timers, let’s actually recruit 30,000 people full-time to be in the services – and a similar principle will of course apply across the navy and air force.”He stated his belief that the government had neglected defence “very, very badly” and that the UK should be spending 3 per cent of GDP as quickly as possible.Turning to public services, Mr Farage said a “radical cultural rethink” needs to take place before he highlighted concerns over knife crime.He said: “We’ve no doubt that an approach to policing such as stop-and-search and don’t worry if you’re called prejudiced or you’re doing something wrong, actually you’ll save lives.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage launches his party’s ‘Contract with You’ in Merthyr Tydfil (Ben Birchall/PA) (PA Wire)Net-zero targets and HS2 to be scrapped, Reform UK vows13:35 , Holly EvansReform has vowed to scrap net-zero targets to save £30 billion a year for the next 25 years.The party also promises to fast-track licences of North Sea oil and gas licences.A pledge to scrap HS2 to save £25 billion is also included in the party’s document, along with a ban on Ulez and Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs).Nigel Farage has promised to fast-track licenses of North Sea oil and gas licences (Reuters)Nigel Farage claims government failed to ‘implement’ Brexit during manifesto launch13:30 , Holly EvansFarage acknowledges Reform UK will not form next government13:25 , Holly EvansNigel Farage acknowledged that Reform UK would not form the government after the July 4 General Election – but he said it was the first step on the road to the next contest which could be in 2029.Speaking in Merthyr Tydfil he said: “We are not pretending that we are going to win this General Election, we are a very, very new political party.”He added: “This is not something with which we’re going to govern the country. That’s not possible in this election.“Although this election is for our party, and for me, the first important step on the road to 2029.“Our ambition is to establish a bridgehead in Parliament, and to become a real opposition to a Labour government.”Number of tax cuts promised including abolishing stamp duty13:22 , Holly EvansThe document contains five core pledges - and the first two focus heavily on immigration, while others focus on the economy, education andReform wants to “simplify” the UK’s tax system which it says is more 21,000 pages, while Hong Kong’s is 500 pages.The party is also proposing to lift the minimum profit threshold to £100,000 and reduce the main corporation tax rate from 25% to 15% in three years, which it says would “free” 1.2 million businesses.A raft of tax cuts are also promised, including raising the minimum threshold of income tax to £20,000 a year, abolishing stamp duty, and abolishing inheritance tax for all estates under £2m.

I mean, there have been some unforced errors. There have been some forced errors as well for that matter.”He also said he would serve in the Conservative Party alongside Nigel Farage if the Reform UK leader is welcomed into the fold after the election.He added: “You have to consider the fact that a split right is not good.

But I think in the end, there are only two people who can be in Downing Street, it’s either Rishi Sunak or it’s Keir Starmer.“And if you vote Reform, or Lib Dem, or any other direction for that matter, that simply helps Keir Starmer go in with unchecked power to do things like release all the people who’ve already been rounded up to be deported, which is exactly the opposite to what a lot of Reform voters would want.”When questioned on polls continuing to show a Conservative defeat, Mr Shapps pointed to previous polls which suggested Britain would remain in the European Union and former prime minister Theresa May would increase her majority.He added: “Polls have a history of showing a snapshot in time, which isn’t necessarily the time when the vote happens.” (Getty)Reform candidate made ‘daft comments'08:02 , Matt MathersReform UK said its former candidate Grant St Clair-Armstrong made “daft” comments at a “difficult and angry time in his life”, after he resigned from the party for previously calling on people to vote for the British National Party (BNP).Mr St Clair-Armstrong, who will remain on the ballot paper as an independent in North West Essex, posted on a blog called the Joli Triste in 2010: “I could weep now, every time I pick up a British newspaper and read the latest about the state of the UK.“No doubt, Enoch Powell would be doing the same if he was alive. My solution … vote BNP!”A Reform UK party spokesperson said: “Some 15 years ago, by own admission made some daft, inappropriate comments at a difficult and angry time in his life.“He regrets them, and has resigned.”Shapps: Unlikely we’ll win election but it’s still possible07:50 , Matt MathersGrant Shapps said it is unlikely the Tories will win at the general election, but it remains a possibility.The defence secretary told Times Radio it is “possible to win the election”, but conceded that it is “not the most likely outcome”, adding: “I’m a realist.”Asked if a Tory victory was unlikely he replied: “I think that’s the realistic position, isn’t it? I mean, I live in the real world. So you know, let’s not try and pretend black is white.”Mr Shapps also said he stands by the comments he made last week that Labour could secure a “supermajority”.He said: “We’re still fighting for absolutely every single vote, which is absolutely the right thing to do and warning of the dangers of Labour.“But what I said last week stands, a blank cheque, a supermajority is a dangerous thing, particularly when we already know they have these plans to change the council tax bands.”Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said it would be ‘very bad news’ for the country if Labour leader Sir Keir won a

155,"Penny Mordaunt has issued a rallying call to beleaguered Tories across the UK that the election result is “not a foregone conclusion” – but conceded that her party is now very much “the underdog”.With many seeing Ms Mordaunt as a leader in waiting after a Tory defeat, she admits she felt “let down” by Rishi Sunak over the D-Day fiasco, which hit the headlines just hours before she was due to take part in a televised debate.But she also made it clear that she wants to see tax cuts, in a message to her party as well as the country.The Tory cabinet minister gave a wide-ranging interview to The Independent from her bellwether constituency of Portsmouth North. Ms Mordaunt won the seat from Labour on her second attempt in 2010, and has increased her majority in each election since. In the interview, she addressed:The inside story of how she reacted when she learnt that the prime minister had left the D-Day commemorations earlyWhy she believes the Tories need to be pushing tax cutsWhy the polls could be wrongHow she deals with misogyny in politicsHow she prepared for the TV debatesPenny Mordaunt is seen by many as a leader in waiting (ITV)Apart from Mr Sunak, Ms Mordaunt has been the only cabinet minister the Tories have trusted to stand front and centre in the election campaign with her two appearances in the seven-way party debates.When news broke on 6 June that Mr Sunak had left the D-Day events in Normandy early, Ms Mordaunt was campaigning in Portsmouth, the home of the Royal Navy, where the liberation of Europe was planned and launched.She had attended the events in Portsmouth the day before, and was getting ready for the first of the two televised debates, which was due to take place the following day. Her first statement on the debate that Friday was extraordinary, declaring that the prime minister had been “wrong”.Ms Mordaunt shares a moment with Angela Rayner after the first televised debate (BBC)“I felt the same as every one of my constituents,” she told The Independent. “And that was that we were let down, and I think the prime minister rightly apologised for that.”Portsmouth prides itself on being Britain’s “most patriotic city” and is full of Royal Navy veterans who have served around the world as well as being home to current serving personnel. Ms Mordaunt, who is in the Royal Navy Reserve herself, described her reception when she met veterans a few days later.“I’ve been out at a veterans’ event since, because we had the 42nd anniversary of the Falklands war [on Friday],” she said. “And so I was out with a lot of them then, and I got a very warm response from them.“I think it is what it is. I’m sure that the prime minister, if he could turn back time, would do something different. It’s done, and he was just right to apologise. There’s nothing else that he could have done, I think, in that circumstance.”The campaign has seen many setbacks for the Conservatives right from the start, when the nation watched the prime minister get drenched as he announced a snap election in a rain-sodden Downing Street.But with less than three weeks to go, Ms Mordaunt still believes her party can turn its fortunes around.“We are the underdog, yes,” she said. “There are lots of pundits, and some politicians, saying it’s all a foregone conclusion. Of course, it’s not. It’s going to come down to what people do with their votes – and I’m fighting for my city, and I’m going to carry on fighting until the polls shut.“We’re getting a really good response from people [on the doorstep in Portsmouth]. We’ve helped a lot of people, and they know who I am, and what I’ve done, and what I stand for.”The D-Day 80th anniversary in Portsmouth, Ms Mordaunt’s constituency (AP)She added: “A poll is a poll. It’s just statistics, but it’s not reflected from our experience on the doors here.”Ms Mordaunt laughed at the idea that she is a “celebrity politician”, but admits that fame has its advantages.“People know me,” she explained. “I don’t have to introduce myself, but it’s been great. And it’s just been really pleasant, actually chatting to people, and I think we’ve been offering the right things.”She is also clear that taxes are the way for the Tories to turn things around, even though a Techne UK poll for The Independent revealed that trust in her party over the issue has collapsed.In an apparent message to her party leadership, she also pushed for tax cuts after reports that cabinet ministers had pushed for more in the manifesto.“There are some blue skies ahead, and now’s the point where we need to go further on those tax cuts,” she said. “As the campaign has gone on, people have been raising concerns back to me. There’s distrust there, because of Labour’s previous record of being in government and what they’ve done elsewhere.“[Labour’s] taxes – that’s always bitten this city hard. With fuel duty, [there are] traders here, freight is important here, and people remember Labour’s fuel duty escalator – and we’ve frozen fuel duty for 14 years because we understand that is critical, not just to motorists and freight, but to people’s supermarket bills as well.”Ms Mordaunt says Rishi Sunak ‘rightly’ apologised for leaving the D-Day commemoration early (Sky News)She insists that her city’s experience of a Labour government before 2010 is why she believes that her party needs to keep fighting to the end.“I feel really strongly about stopping a Labour government. Last time they were in power, it meant, here in Portsmouth, we had the worst MRSA infections in a hospital in the country; [we had the] worst maths results. We had raw sewage running off Portsdown Hill. We had terrible flooding.“Cosham town centre was underwater in the winter. We had 600 kids playing truant for more than six months out of the school year. It was terrible, and taxes were high. We had tax-credit maladministration. It was awful.”She is less willing to address the future beyond 4 July though, including her own potential leadership ambitions or the possibility of Nigel Farage joining the Tories.“It really isn’t about us, you know, as individual politicians. It’s about the country, and it’s about my community.”While Ms Mordaunt is not pencilled in for any more TV debates, she said she is willing to go into battle again if there is a “Deploy! Deploy! Deploy!” command from CCHQ (Conservative Campaign Headquarters).She insists there was little preparation ahead of her appearances, which saw her dominate both debates with ferocious attacks on Labour’s deputy leader Angela Rayner.“I’m not particularly precious,” she said. “I know what I want to say and just go for it.”And Ms Mordaunt has sought to quash speculation that her hair – which became a social media phenomenon during the first debate – was a deliberate tactic.“I’m afraid no thought went into it whatsoever,” she explains. “On both occasions, someone else did my hair. I had other things to concentrate on.”After her second debate, The Independent revealed some of the misogynistic comments made on a Tory members’ Facebook group about her. But Ms Mordaunt shrugs such comments off.“I tend not to worry about these kinds of things,” she said. “But look, I’m a 51-year-old woman, I’ve had a fair deal in my lifetime, but it shouldn’t stop you doing anything. I don’t give it a second thought.”","Tories are the underdog in the election, Mordaunt says, as she calls for party to ignore polls and rally",6,9

In an interview with The Independent, Ms Mordaunt said: “There are lots of pundits, and some politicians, saying it’s all a foregone conclusion. Of course it’s not. It’s going to come down to what people do with their votes – and I’m fighting for my city, and I’m going to carry on fighting until the polls shut.”Mr Sunak on Monday insisted the Conservatives are “on the right track”, despite Mr Shapps’s comments.Speaking from Centrica’s Rough 47-3B gas rig, the PM said: “There’s still two and a half weeks to go in this election, I’m fighting hard for every vote because I believe we can win.“And there’s a very clear choice at this election: it’s having your taxes cut by the Conservatives or facing significant tax rises with the Labour Party.”But, speaking to The Times, cabinet figures called for Mr Sunak to go after Sir Keir’s work as a human rights lawyer, his support for ex-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his calls for a second Brexit referendum.One said: “Rishi is a really nice and deeply honourable guy. I’m not sure whether he’s uncomfortable instinctively with the personalised attacks but it has been more generalised so far.“He will sign a deal with the French, he will undo Brexit, he will rip apart our institutions. The guy’s a socialist, and there’s a real chance people will give him a free rein if they back Reform.”Another said: “He needs to make it personal. I think he was very badly affected by D-Day but he needs to go after Starmer now ... I don’t think there are any other options left.”Mr Sunak returned to the campaign trail on Monday (PA Wire)The minister was referring to Mr Sunak’s disastrous decision to leave early during commemorations for the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings.Another senior Tory told The Times: “Rishi needs to go for the jugular. His natural instincts are not to go for the jugular. That can be useful. But it’s not useful when you’re in a fight to the death. The question is whether the Tories will end up with closer to 100 seats or closer to 200.”An ally of the PM pointed to his attacks on Sir Keir during the first head-to-head debate on ITV in which Mr Sunak referenced the Labour leader’s past work as a defence lawyer on behalf of radical cleric Abu Qatada.Another perceived weakness among Tories is Sir Keir’s past support for Mr Corbyn, which saw him come unstuck during a grilling by Sky News presenter Beth Rigby.Under repeated questioning, Sir Keir said he only campaigned for a Labour win in 2019 because he wanted good Labour MPs to keep their seats and was “certain we would lose”.Labour Party leader Keir Starmer’s previous support for Jeremy Corbyn is seen as a weakness by some Tories (PA Wire)Labour has promised not to rejoin the EU single market if it wins the election.Asked about calls for Mr Sunak to “go for the jugular”, Mr Shapps told Sky News: “It is right that we highlight the risks of an unchecked Labour majority … because people need to know what they would be getting which is a heck of a lot more tax to pay in every direction.”He stressed that the Conservatives are the underdogs at the election but claimed “I still think we can do it”. Mr Shapps added: “I really think it’s important to warn people that voting any other way apart from Conservative guarantees a Labour-Starmer government.“Now, if that’s what you want, then fine. But, actually, if you don’t relish the idea of Starmer coming in, raising your taxes, having no plan for illegal migration … voting any other way than Conservative would be dangerous because it would allow Starmer a blank cheque to do those things and many other things besides.”",Grant Shapps admits Tories ‘unlikely’ to win election as Sunak urged to ‘go for jugular’ on Starmer,7,9
255,"Sir Keir Starmer dismissed “noises off” from Nigel Farage as he said the election was a two-horse race between Labour and the Conservatives.The Labour leader said voters had a “simple choice” between him and Rishi Sunak amid the growing popularity of Reform since Mr Farage returned to front line politics.A YouGov poll last week was the first to show Reform on a greater share of the vote than the Tories, with the party polling at its highest-ever levels in the past fortnight.Speaking to reporters during a visit to Southampton, Sir Keir said: “The election is a straight choice between more of the same under the Conservatives and rebuilding the country with us. There are only two candidates for prime minister.“We are absolutely focused on talking to people about what matters to them. That’s where my focus is, not the noises off. You certainly get a lot of noise from Nigel Farage, but I’m focused on the choice at this election.”Sir Keir also declined to say whether he agreed with Lord Cameron, the Foreign Secretary, who criticised Mr Farage’s “highly inflammatory language” and accused him of “dog whistle politics”.“The choice on July 4 is a choice of two different governments,” he said. “All the noises off don’t change that simple choice.”Sir Keir’s remarks came after he took part in a question-and-answer session with Rachel Reeves, his shadow chancellor, about their plans for the economy and green investment.He said Labour would not take the UK back into the European Union but would instead seek to renegotiate the post-Brexit deal between Britain and the bloc, saying there was a “better deal to be had”.In a swipe at the Government, Sir Keir added: “I think there has been too much self-entitlement in politics recently. We want to return it to service. That means it will be your government.”Sir Keir also said he was “very glad” he had campaigned for Labour at the 2019 election while serving as the shadow Brexit secretary under Jeremy Corbyn .“I campaigned for the Labour Party, I’ve always campaigned for the Labour Party,” he said. “And I wanted to make sure that good colleagues were returned and really good colleagues were returned – Yvette [Cooper], Ed [Miliband], Bridget [Phillipson], people like that, who might otherwise have lost their seats and are now a central part of the shadow cabinet.“So I’m very glad I campaigned good and hard for Labour at the last election.”Last week, the Labour leader was unable to clarify why he had told voters Mr Corbyn would make a “great prime minister”, only to subsequently suspend his predecessor amid a row over anti-Semitism in the party.",Starmer dismisses Farage ‘noise’ and says election race between Labour and Tories,7,11

The survey of 22,000 people also forecast Reform UK to win seven seats.And on Monday morning, Mr Farage vowed his party would offer a “proper voice of opposition” in an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.At the weekend, Suella Braverman said she would invite Mr Farage back into the party.

I mean, there have been some unforced errors.

But I think in the end, there are only two people who can be in Downing Street, it’s either Rishi Sunak or it’s Keir Starmer.“And if you vote Reform, or Lib Dem, or any other direction for that matter, that simply helps Keir Starmer go in with unchecked power to do things like release all the people who’ve already been rounded up to be deported, which is exactly the opposite to what a lot of Reform voters would want.”When questioned on polls continuing to show a Conservative defeat, Mr Shapps pointed to previous polls which suggested Britain would remain in the European Union and former prime minister Theresa May would increase her majority.He added: “Polls have a history of showing a snapshot in time, which isn’t necessarily the time when the vote happens.” (Getty)Reform candidate made ‘daft comments'08:02 , Matt MathersReform UK said its former candidate Grant St Clair-Armstrong made “daft” comments at a “difficult and angry time in his life”, after he resigned from the party for previously calling on people to vote for the British National Party (BNP).Mr St Clair-Armstrong, who will remain on the ballot paper as an independent in North West Essex, posted on a blog called the Joli Triste in 2010: “I could weep now, every time I pick up a British newspaper and read the latest about the state of the UK.“No doubt, Enoch Powell would be doing the same if he was alive. My solution … vote BNP!”A Reform UK party spokesperson said: “Some 15 years ago, by own admission made some daft, inappropriate comments at a difficult and angry time in his life.“He regrets them, and has resigned.”Shapps: Unlikely we’ll win election but it’s still possible07:50 , Matt MathersGrant Shapps said it is unlikely the Tories will win at the general election, but it remains a possibility.The defence secretary told Times Radio it is “possible to win the election”, but conceded that it is “not the most likely outcome”, adding: “I’m a realist.”Asked if a Tory victory was unlikely he replied: “I think that’s the realistic position, isn’t it? I mean, I live in the real world. So you know, let’s not try and pretend black is white.”Mr Shapps also said he stands by the comments he made last week that Labour could secure a “supermajority”.He said: “We’re still fighting for absolutely every single vote, which is absolutely the right thing to do and warning of the dangers of Labour.“But what I said last week stands, a blank cheque, a supermajority is a dangerous thing, particularly when we already know they have these plans to change the council tax bands.”Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said it would be ‘very bad news’ for the country if Labour leader Sir Keir won a

Pointing out that the word “cringe” isn’t grammatically correct when used as an adjective, and it should instead be “cringe-worthy” or at least “cringey”? Apparently, I’m cringe now.Luckily for us, we still have people in the UK who are willing to step up and show us what it truly means to be cringe. Unluckily for us, they’re the people who run our political establishments and make our laws.

newsletter, which Mr Hunt released to his constituents in recent days, totally shreds the Tory manifesto and totally shreds any remaining credibility on tax and spend the Tories once had.”A Conservative Party spokesman said: “Unless action is taken, the working-age welfare bill will rise by more than £20 billion a year by the end of the decade.“Labour is in complete denial about this and don’t think it’s possible to save a single penny from this unsustainable rise.“We don’t think that’s right, which is why have set out how we would save £12 billion from the welfare bill by the end of the next parliament, including by controlling spending on health and disability benefits and taking people’s benefits away after 12 months if they don’t accept a job.“Keir Starmer’s refusal to even

43,"Do you have particularly strong feelings of disgust when confronted with something revolting like vomit or a cockroach?Believe it or not, that could influence the way you place your vote in this year’s general election. Similar feelings play a part in whether you are open to new experiences, such as trying strange dishes in a restaurant or bungee jumping.Voting is often irrational, and factors such as charismatic leaders can often sway which box people tick on their ballot, says Dr Rebekah Wanic, a mindset psychologist, university lecturer and self-optimisation coach.Read more: 'Why I’m voting tactically in the general election'Dr Wanic, founder of Vent to Reinvent, says that the reasons people vote certain ways are complex. People can and do change the way they vote, she says, but the reasons this happens are not always what you might expect.'Bad' stories tend to stick more than good policiesIn this election, prime minister Rishi Sunak has been the subject of negative stories around his attendance at the D-Day service and his ‘deprivation’ in not having a Sky dish as a child.Negative stories tend to ‘stick’ more in people’s minds even than more relevant information such as new policies, Dr Wanic explains.She said: ""Humans are predisposed to pay attention to negative information and give it more diagnostic weight because of a negativity bias. These types of stories typically have a strong emotional component, which makes them stick out more in memory as well so they have more long-term impact.""Users on social media platforms reinforce these tendencies by sharing more negative stories as well.""People who feel disgust strongly tend to be conservativeStudies have shown that people who feel disgust strongly may have more right-wing political views - with volunteers confronted with images of cockroaches, vomit and snakes.Other studies have suggested that right-wingers tend to be more disturbed by threatening facial expressions.Dr Rebekah Wanic, a mindset psychologist, university lecturer and self-optimisation coach (Vent to Reinvent)But while studies have shown a link, it’s best to take these with a tiny pinch of salt, says Dr Wanic.She said: ""Most work here is from lab-based assessments, which is not to say it’s inaccurate but making strong claims about the role of disgust should be tempered because the active role of disgust online during vote casting has not been definitively outlined.""Left-wingers tend to be more open to experienceSome psychological research suggests that left-wingers tend to be more open to new experiences than right-wingers. So if you’re the sort of person who is constantly learning new musical instruments, or exploring the back of beyond, it’s more likely you’ll be left wing.By contrast people with high conscientiousness (ie who are good at regulating their impulses) and are careful and diligent tend to gravitate to right-wing parties. Dr Wanic said that the evidence around these studies is ‘mixed’, but, ‘Conservatives tend to be more risk averse while liberals tend to be more tolerant of ambiguity.’Voters don’t always vote in their own interestThere’s a lot of psychological research which suggests that voters often don’t vote in their own interest, Dr Wanic said. Instead, charismatic candidates and factors such as the ‘likeability’ of politicians can sway people to vote in ways that aren’t actually good for them.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

This is likely, in part, the result of growing up and having different interactions with the world compared to those of younger voters.""","The hidden psychology behind why people vote for certain partiesVoting is often irrational, and factors such as charismatic leaders can often sway which box people tick on their ballot, says mindset psychologist Dr Rebekah Wanic.",7,13
249,"Since May 2023, voters across the UK have been asked to show a form of photographic ID at their local ballot box.The requirement draws on the recommendations of a 2016 report by Lord Pickles, the former communities secretary, which warned there was a risk of “significant abuse” in the electoral system if people could vote under false pretences with little risk of detection.As Labour holds their 20 percentage point lead in the latest election opinion polls, The Telegraph sets out everything you need to know about voting rules ahead of the general election on July 4.Here are the acceptable forms of identification you can bring to vote on an election candidate. Follow The Telegraph’s general election live coverageWhat are the voter ID requirements?Everyone wanting to vote in the UK must produce photo ID to take part in certain elections.For voters in England, Scotland and Wales, this includes UK parliamentary elections, by-elections and recall petitions. Those in England also need their ID for local elections.The requirement does not apply to Holyrood, Senedd or council elections in Scotland and Wales. People in Northern Ireland already needed photo ID to vote, so the rule change does not affect them.Voters in both England and Wales also need ID for police and crime commissioner elections.The rule has been applied in stages, beginning with the local elections in England on May 4, 2023. This year’s general election will be the first time ID is required for a national poll.The change marks a significant departure from the previous system in most of the UK, where voters only had to verbally confirm their name and address.What types of ID are accepted?Voters are required to show one form of photo ID at the polls, and it does not need to be in date so long as it is recognisable as the person at the ballot box.However, it must be the original version – not a photocopy – and the name on the ID should be the same as it appears on the electoral register.Acceptable forms of voter ID include:Passport issued by the UK, any of the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, a British Overseas Territory, an EEA state or a Commonwealth country (including an Irish Passport Card)Full or provisional driving licence issued by the UK, any of the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, or an EEA stateA Blue BadgeAny identity card bearing the Pass (Proof of Age Standards Scheme) hologramAny of the following travel passes:Older person’s bus pass funded by the GovernmentDisabled person’s bus pass funded by the GovernmentOyster 60+ card funded by the GovernmentFreedom passScottish national entitlement card issued for the purpose of concessionary travel (including a 60+, disabled or under 22s bus pass)60 and over Welsh concessionary travel cardDisabled person’s Welsh concessionary travel cardSenior SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandRegistered blind SmartPass or blind person’s SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandWar disablement SmartPass issued in Northern Ireland60+ SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandHalf fare SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandAny of these government-issued documents:Biometric immigration documentMinistry of Defence Form 90 (Defence Identity Card)National identity card issued by an EEA stateElectoral identity card issued in Northern IrelandVoter authority certificateAnonymous elector’s documentDo the rules apply to postal votes?No. You do not need to have any form of photo ID to vote by post.However, you will be asked to provide your National Insurance (NI) number when you apply to verify your identity. If you are not able to do this, you will need to explain why.The deadline to apply for a postal vote is 5pm on Wednesday June 19 in England, Scotland and Wales, with Saturday June 15 the limit in Northern Ireland. You must also be registered to vote.How can I get a voter ID card?You can apply for a free voter authority certificate (VAC) either online or by post. To complete an online application, you will need a recent, digital photo of yourself and your NI number.You can still apply if you don’t have an NI number but you will need to provide alternative documents as proof of identity, such as your birth certificate, a bank statement or utility bill.To apply by post, you will need to fill out and send a form to your local electoral registration office.You will need the address of where you are registered to vote, a recent photo of yourself and your NI number.Again, other supporting documents are accepted but using these may prolong the application process.The electoral registration office must receive your form by 5pm, six working days before the election you wish to vote in.There is a different form to complete if you want to apply by post and you are living abroad, a member of the Armed Forces, a civil servant or a British Council employee.What if I do not have a valid ID?Anyone without a form of ID that fits the requirements can apply for a VAC.This is not a substitute to registering for vote, which must be done in advance of any application.Why was voter ID introduced?The aim was to stamp out voter fraud by forcing people to prove their identity at the polls.In his Government-commissioned report, Lord Pickles warned that the authorities were in a “state of denial” and “turning a blind eye” to the problem of electoral fraud.Why is voter ID so controversial?The Government has said the change is necessary to curb the “inexcusable potential” for “stealing someone’s vote” by simply quoting their name and address at the ballot box.However, critics say actual claims of electoral fraud are very rare in the UK.In 2019, the last general election year, there were only 33 allegations of impersonation at the polling station out of more than 58 million votes cast, according to the Electoral Reform Society.Opponents of the rule have also warned it will make it more difficult for certain people to vote, including the disabled, transgender and non-binary people, and black and ethnic minority groups.",The photo ID you need to vote in UK elections,8,11
41,"By the time I pedalled wearily into the broad High Street of Northallerton, I was rather wishing I had made the trip across Rishi Sunak’s vast constituency by helicopter.The prosperous county town of North Yorkshire is partnered with Richmond in the prime minister’s home patch. The parliamentary boundaries of Richmond and Northallerton stretch fully two-thirds of the way across the north of England.It is a canvasser’s nightmare. The western end is 20 miles from the Irish Sea at Morecambe Bay, while the eastern edge is just five miles from Yorkshire’s North Sea coast. So thinly populated is it that I encountered many sheep before meeting anyone with an actual vote.Keir Starmer’s constituency, in contrast, is a narrow and densely populated rectangle of north-central London. Holborn and St Pancras runs from Tufnell Park in the north (not a park but a Tube station) to Covent Garden in the south. I reckon you could pedal the whole thing in 20 minutes without breaking either the law or a sweat.I took my time to evaluate the tourism potential of each. Would the leader of the opposition’s vibrant community prevail over the hundreds of square miles of sunlit uplands in the prime minister’s constituency?The scores are now in, with 100 points divided between the candidates over 10 rounds.Getting there: For my visit to Rishi Sunak-land, I arrived from Kirkby Stephen, a station on the Settle & Carlisle Line in Cumbria. There is one main-line rail station in Richmond and Northallerton: the latter town is astride the East Coast line. Trains run from Northallerton to London King’s Cross in about three-and-a-half hours.All three north-facing termini in the capital are in Keir Starmer’s constituency: King’s Cross, St Pancras and Euston. The eastern edge borders an entrance to Farringdon station on the Elizabeth Line.Starmer 8, Sunak 2Nearest airport: Closest to Holborn and St Pancras is London City (seven miles). Closest to Richmond and Northallerton is Teesside (200 yards). Helicopter parking available. To be fair, though, London is the world centre of aviation; Teesside is not (yet).Sunak 8, Starmer 2Getting around: Keir Starmer’s voters can choose from a dozen Tube stations. Between the Piccadilly line stations of Holborn and St Pancras, the Piccadilly Line runs every couple of minutes.Which way now? Starmer’s constituency has more stations than Sunak’s (Simon Calder)Between Richmond and Northallerton – the two towns in Sunak’s constituency – bus 55 runs three times a day (except Sundays and public holidays) and takes 38 minutes.But the London Tube costs more (minimum £2.70) than the elusive North Yorkshire bus (£2, or free for the pensioners who comprised the entire population of the one I saw).Sunak 5, Starmer 5Accommodation: St Pancras may have the magnificent Renaissance hotel, built into the fabric of the world’s greatest railway station. But for value, the Catterick Garrison Premier Inn wins every time. On election night the rate is £84 for a double.Same room type, same chain, different constituency: a painful £198 at the King’s Cross. That is 135 per cent more. “If you think Labour will win, start saving now,” advises the prime minister.Sunak 8, Starmer 2Eating and drinking: Central London has rather more culinary choice than rural North Yorkshire, but for the purposes of fair comparison the only common thread is Wetherspoons.At the Barrel Vault inside St Pancras station, a pint of Carlsberg and a burger costs £11.58. At the Buck Inn in Northallerton’s High Street, the same tasty combo comes in at just £6.03.Sunak 8, Starmer 2Cheap and cheerful: the Buck Inn, the Wetherspoons pub in Northallerton (Simon Calder)Culture: Keir Starmer is MP for the British Museum, which has the largest permanent collection in the world. It features the Elgin Marbles (Room 18) and the Rosetta Stone (Room 4). Admission is free.Rishi Sunak is MP for the Richmondshire Museum, which has some shovels on display in the Tyson Gallery. Admission £7.Starmer 9, Sunak 1Nature: Richmond and Northallerton is surely the most scenic inland constituency in England. In the west, the Yorkshire Dales begin high on the moors, with sparkling water carving deep valleys that become populated by pretty villages as you descend. The patchwork landscape is embroidered by dry-stone walls, and even the large military presence (and Premier Inn) at Catterick is softened by woodland.Farmer Starmer? Not in London NW1. Holborn, St Pancras and “nature” do not easily combine in the same sentence. The closest you can get to the great outdoors is the Camley Street Natural Park beside the canal, run by the Wildlife Trust.Sunak 9, Starmer 1Red peril? Kentish Town Road, in the middle of Keir Starmer’s constituency (Simon Calder)Shopping: Camden Market (daily except Christmas Day) vs Northallerton Outdoor Market (Wednesdays and Saturdays).Starmer 8, Sunak 2Spirituality: Each constituency has an exquisite medieval church. St Wilfrid’s in Langton-on-Swale in North Yorkshire has outlasted the parish: not a house can be seen from the churchyard. The rector, Jenni Lane, says: “Only the calling of the birds can be heard and sometimes the bleating of sheep or an occasional distant car or tractor. It is one of the most peaceful places imaginable.”Follow the lane to the end and you reach the banks of the Swale as it throws a lazy loop on its gentle journey to the sea.From the churchyard of the 12th-century St Pancras Old Church in London, all you can hear is the drone of trains from the tracks 50 yards away, and the traffic along Pancras Road on the other side.

239,"Scotland’s First Minister has challenged Scottish Labour to stand up to Sir Keir Starmer in demanding an end to the two-child benefit cap.John Swinney has said the 2017 policy, which restricts child tax and universal credits to the first two children in the majority of households, was politically “indefensible”.It also comes with an associated rape clause which allows women who conceived a subsequent child through coercion or abuse to apply for an exemption.Pressure has been mounting on Sir Keir to scrap the cap after the party’s manifesto included a desire to reduce child poverty but failed to mention the specific policy.Anas Sarwar has said his Scottish Labour party backed scrapping the limit but now faces additional calls to convince his UK party to take the same approach.READ MORE: Anas Sarwar promises pay hike for 40,000 young Scots as he eyes up 2026 electionIt comes as Mr Sarwar sets out his party’s manifesto on Tuesday amid warnings from the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) that the number of children impacted by the cap will rise to about 670,000 in the next five years, while 250,000 will be affected next year.Appealing to Mr Sarwar, SNP leader Mr Swinney said: “If Labour’s manifesto is to be believed, they have the financial headroom to scrap this policy – that they are refusing to do so is clearly an attempt to talk tough on social security as they seek right-wing votes south of the border.“Politics is about choices – and Labour is choosing to prioritise austerity over lifting thousands of children out of poverty. It is a completely indefensible political decision.“Anas Sarwar also has a choice – he can choose doing the right thing for vulnerable children in Scotland, or doing what he is told by Keir Starmer. That is a decision that will speak volumes – and the people of Scotland will be watching.”READ MORE: Forbes blasts Labour and Tories on immigration for 'actively harming' economyHe added: “That Labour under Keir Starmer intend to continue with this Tory policy makes clear just how far removed they are from Scotland’s values.“I am calling on Anas Sarwar and Labour in Scotland to join with me in demanding that Keir Starmer immediately change course and abandon this hated Tory policy.”Scottish Labour social justice spokesperson Paul O’Kane said: “Tackling child poverty has been part of Labour’s mission from day one – as our record in government makes clear.“But right across Scotland, children have been let down by the toxic combination of two bad governments.“The Tory government in Westminster has shown how little it cares about Scotland’s kids, but the SNP is also trying to deflect blame.“John Swinney, Humza Yousaf and Nicola Sturgeon have all broken promises, having presided over virtually static rates for children in poverty.“A UK Labour government with Scottish MPs at its heart will tackle poverty at its root by making work pay, cutting bills, growing our economy, supporting affordable housing and reviewing Universal Credit.“Scotland’s young people deserve a better future.”",Swinney: Scottish Labour should stand up to Starmer over two-child benefit cap,8,2
187,"Rishi Sunak has announced a general election for July 4, as the country prepares for its first national vote since 2019.Here, The Telegraph examines the processes involved, including how votes are called and who can take part.When is the general election?Why is there an election now?Why was the general election not on the same day as the local elections?What happens next?How are general elections called?How often are elections called?Who can vote in the general election?When should I register to vote?When will polling take place?When is the general election?The general election will take place on July 4 as the country heads to the polls between 7am and 10pm to have their say on the next prime minister. It had looked likely that Rishi Sunak would wait until the autumn to call the next election, but the Prime Minister announced in a rain-sodden speech outside of Downing Street on May 22 that July 4 was the chosen date.Follow The Telegraph’s live general election coverageMany assumed Mr Sunak would want more time for the new Rwanda deterrent and recent tax cuts to take effect, having described a ballot in the second half of the year as his “working assumption”.But speculation reached fever pitch in Westminster when the Conservatives refused to rule out an election being called that day. That afternoon, an umbrella-less Mr Sunak announced his snap election decision and set in motion the vote to happen six weeks later on July 4.The choice means that Mr Sunak will have been in No 10 for 618 days by the polling date and has been called a “mistake” by figures like Prof Sir John Curtice, the polling expert.Why is there an election now?Tory figures close to general election planning had also been working under the assumption there was not going to be a summer ballot, but that all changed on May 22.Lord Cameron cut a trip to Albania short in order to return to a Cabinet meeting and Grant Shapps delayed a flight to a Nato meeting two hours to be there.On the day of the announcement, news came that the rate of inflation had fallen even further than expected, which Mr Sunak hailed as a sign that “everything is heading in the right direction”.With the Government’s record perhaps at its strongest on the economy, the Prime Minister was keen to use the news as a launchpad for triggering the election – but what else played into his decision?Key factors for the Prime Minister would have included whether economic statistics was continuing to improve, and whether polling and focus group research suggested that voters were feeling the positive effects of the National Insurance cuts, crediting the Tories for the boost.Getting Rwanda deportation flights off the ground also strengthened the case for going to the polls in the summer, along with a steady decline in the NHS elective waiting list.It had been rumoured that figures in Downing Street were mulling over whether it would be in the Tories’ interests to trigger a ballot sooner rather than later, despite being way behind Labour in the polls.Why was the general election not on the same day as the local elections?The general election could have been called on May 2 - the same day as the locals - but Rishi Sunak made the decision to avoid a spring poll.The Institute for Government pointed out that a spring election would avoid the risk that “a heavy defeat in the local elections could increase pressure on the Prime Minister – including from within his party – and make it difficult to regain momentum ahead of an election that would by then be less than a year away”.However, that opportunity passed. On March 14, the Prime Minister ruled out a national ballot on May 2, confirming there “won’t be a general election on that day”.It was thought that heavy losses at the locals could tempt restless Tory MPs to mount a challenge against their leader.However, despite a dire set of results for the Conservatives, resulting in hundreds of council seats lost, the rebels appear to have backed off for now.What happens next? Following Mr Sunak’s announcement on May 22, Parliament was prorogued and dissolved eight days later on May 30 after the Prime Minister was granted permission by the King Charles.Prorogation happened on May 24, in line with the 2022 Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act that sets out polling day to take place 25 working days following the dissolution on May 30, landing the general election on July 4.Election candidates have begun to use the six-week lead up to ballot day to campaign for their parties, including both Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer who have undertaken appearances up and down the country.Both leaders, and many more political figures, have also taken part in TV election debates in a bid to win over voters and released their 2024 party manifestos, starting with the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives. It is up to each party when to publish its manifesto, but an analysis by the Institute for Government shows that all Labour and Conservative manifestos since 1997 have been launched between 18 and 29 days before the election.Voter registration is usually open until the 12th working day before polling day, which indicates that it will close towards the end of June.How are general elections called?It is up to the Prime Minister to decide when to hold a national vote, but this power has only been restored in recent years.In 2011, the Fixed Term Parliaments Act effectively put the House of Commons in charge, with general elections held every five years unless a majority of MPs willed it otherwise.For an election to be called early, two thirds of the House had to back the plans. This is how Theresa May’s snap election was triggered in 2017. Alternatively, MPs could spark a ballot by passing a vote of no confidence in the Government.After trying and failing three times to secure the necessary two thirds majority for an early vote in 2019, the Tories opted to circumvent the law with a new purpose-built piece of legislation - the Early Parliamentary General Election Act - which required only a simple majority to pass. This paved the way for Boris Johnson’s snap election in 2019.The Government went on to repeal the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, replacing it with the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act. This new law stripped the Commons of its power to block an early ballot, putting the Prime Minister back in control.Traditionally, the Prime Minister travels to Buckingham Palace to request the dissolution of Parliament, before returning to Downing Street to announce the forthcoming election.How often are elections called? Each Parliament must be dissolved for a general election by the fifth anniversary of the day it first met.This measure was passed under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act by the 2011 coalition government, which set in stone the five-year periods between general elections.Elections may be held earlier – such occurred in 2017 with Theresa May and 2019 by Boris Johnson following a Brexit deadlock – under special circumstances.However, local elections such as the May 2024 by-elections and mayoral elections operate on a different time scale. Who can vote in the general election?The vast majority of UK adults can vote in a general election.In order to vote, you must:be registered to votebe 18 or over on the day of the election (‘polling day’)be a British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizenbe a resident at an address in the UK or Gibraltar, or living abroad and registered as an overseas voter (it is also possible to register if you have no fixed address)not be legally excluded from voting (for example, if you are serving a prison sentence)When should I register to vote?The deadline for registering to vote is usually midnight at the end of the 12th working day before polling day, meaning voter registration is open until June 18 at 11.59pm.When will polling take place?Parliament was dissolved a few days after the election announcement and polling day takes place 25 working days after that.The Civil Service has entered “purdah” – the period between an election being called and polling day which involves strict restrictions on the work of officials to ensure that Whitehall resources are not being used to benefit any party in particular.",When is the general election?

198,"Rishi Sunak has insisted the Tories can still win the General Election after Cabinet minister Grant Shapps said a Conservative victory is unlikely.The Prime Minister said he understands people’s frustrations but gave a more optimistic assessment of his party’s chances than the Defence Secretary, who said that to claim the Tories are on course for a win would be to “try and pretend black is white”.As the party continues to languish behind Labour in the polls, he said Sir Keir Starmer lacked “the courage of his convictions” and suggested his rival would find the job in Downing Street “hard to do well”.Asked during a huddle with journalists on the Tory battlebus about what he thought of his political opponent, the Prime Minister said: “What I’d say is Keir Starmer is someone who clearly doesn’t have the courage of his convictions.“He also is not prioritising investment in our country’s security. I think that is deeply concerning as someone who’s sat in this job for 18 months, at a time when the world is more dangerous and uncertain than it’s been since the end of the Cold War, having just come back from the G7 and a peace summit about Ukraine in Switzerland.“It’s obvious that the world is incredibly dangerous and for someone who wants to be prime minister of our country not to prioritise investing more our country’s security I find deeply concerning.”Mr Sunak’s comments came as Nigel Farage launched Reform UK’s “contract” with voters to add to the Conservatives’ woes.Labour has an average 20-point poll lead over the past week – on 41% ahead of the Tories on 21% and Reform on 15%.Speaking during a visit to a Centrica gas rig earlier on Monday, the Prime Minister said: “There’s still two-and-a-half weeks to go in this election, I’m fighting hard for every vote because I believe we can win.“And there’s a very clear choice at this election: it’s having your taxes cut by the Conservatives or facing significant tax rises with the Labour Party.”(PA Graphics)Asked if he understands people’s frustrations with the Tory Party, with some voters deciding to turn to Reform UK, he replied: “Of course I understand people’s frustrations with that – I mean that’s undeniable, and I’ve been very clear that we have made progress, but there is more to go.“But the point now is we are on the right track and this election is about the future.”Mr Shapps earlier told Times Radio it is “possible to win the election”, but conceded it is “not the most likely outcome”, adding: “I’m a realist.”Asked if a Tory victory is unlikely, he replied: “I think that’s the realistic position, isn’t it? I mean, I live in the real world. So, you know, let’s not try and pretend black is white.”Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer and shadow chancellor Rachel Reeve on a visit to Southampton (Stefan Rousseau/PA)Meanwhile, Labour accused Jeremy Hunt of “admitting” pledges in the Conservative manifesto are “completely unfunded” after the BBC reported the Chancellor last week said that promised tax cuts would be funded by savings from a back-to-work programme announced in the autumn statement.In a sign of the campaign intensifying as it enters its fourth week, shadow paymaster general Jonathan Ashworth put a copy of the Tory document into a shredder at a hastily arranged press conference in London, claiming that is what Mr Hunt had done to the Conservatives’ economic credibility.The Tories have set out plans for billions in tax cuts, which they claim would be paid for by £12 billion of savings on welfare.Mr Sunak’s visit to a Centrica platform in the North Sea came as Mr Farage was setting out Reform’s plans – which he suggested were the first step on the path to a potential election win in 2029.Mr Farage added: “Our ambition is to establish a bridgehead in Parliament, and to become a real opposition to a Labour government.”He said the Tories would not be able to provide opposition because “they spend most of their days arguing among themselves, and they’re split down the middle when it comes to policy”.In other developments:– Reform set out a four-point plan for immigration including: leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, allowing zero illegal immigrants to settle in the UK, establishing a new “Department of Immigration” and returning migrants who come over in boats to France.– Labour claimed Chancellor Jeremy Hunt had driven a “coach and horses” through the Tory’s manifesto promises by saying that a £12 billion squeeze on welfare which the Conservatives plan to use to fund tax cuts had already been announced and factored in to the existing government finances.– Scotland’s First Minister John Swinney said the SNP will include a social tariff on energy, broadband and mobile bills in its manifesto this week.Labour intends to spend the week focusing on its plans for the economy, with shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves joining Sir Keir on the campaign trail.Sir Keir used a visit to a port in Southampton to say that a renegotiated Brexit deal could remove “an inhibitor” to economic growth.Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves and shadow secretary of state for business and trade Jonathan Reynolds met business leaders on Monday morning at the start of a campaign week focusing on the economy (Lucy North/PA)He said: “We took a decision to leave the EU, so we are not going to go back in. But we think the deal we’ve got is botched, it’s not good enough and I think many businesses would say: ‘We need something that works better for us.'”Ms Reeves used a Financial Times interview to suggest she would seek to revise parts of Boris Johnson’s 2020 Brexit deal by seeking closer alignment with EU rules in the chemicals and veterinary sectors, better touring rights for UK artists, and greater mutual recognition of qualifications for financial services workers.The Labour frontbencher also pledged to “hit the ground running to show that Britain is open for business” by holding a global investment summit in the first 100 days of entering government.She met members of her British infrastructure council on Monday morning to discuss attracting foreign investors who have been put off by political instability in the UK.",Sunak: Tories can win General Election but people’s frustration ‘undeniable’,7,4
299,"The Conservatives are facing fresh questions over Rishi Sunak’s flagship national service policy amid increasing confusion about how the scheme will work.Defence secretary Grant Shapps has been accused of plunging the promise into chaos with multiple TV appearances in which he appeared to change course on how the military aspect will be implemented.And shadow defence secretary John Healey has written to Mr Shapps demanding answers about whether the scheme is “fully costed, fully funded, deliverable and clearly set out to the public”. He said ministers are “making it up as they go along” and called the plan a “distraction from their failures in defence over 14 years”.Click here for our live coverage of the general election campaign.In a letter seen by The Independent, the long-serving Labour MP said Mr Shapps had thrown the general election pledge into confusion and called for him to come clean.Defence secretary Grant Shapps has sown confusion about the policy (Yui Mok/PA Wire)The Tory manifesto sets out that every 18-year-old in the UK will be given the choice between a year of civic service or military service.It promised a “year-long full-time placement in the armed forces or cyber defence” for 30,000 18-year-olds, while others will be forced to volunteer for one weekend each month with organisations such as the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI).The military service option promises to be “competitive and paid, so our armed forces recruit and train the brightest and the best”, taking up much of the estimated £2.5bn cost of the policy.But last week Mr Shapps plunged the policy into chaos by claiming 18-year-olds will only take placements in the armed forces for 25 days per year, not the year-long placement originally promised.He told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “It’s not, as you presented, 30,000 people over an entire year, it’s 25 days a year for those 30,000.”Speaking on the same programme a week later, Mr Shapps said he was “referring specifically to the accommodation element”. He added that those taking part would not need to be in accommodation for the year, but for 25 days of training.Mr Healey said the claim raised several questions, most importantly what the service personnel would do for the remaining 340 days of the year when they do not have accommodation.Shadow defence secretary John Healey has demanded Grant Shapps answers questions over the scheme (Yui Mok/PA Wire)He also demanded to know the difference between the 25-day training course for 18-year-olds and the 14-week basic training course required of all other new recruits.“After that 25-day training course, what happens to them for the rest of their twelve months in service?” he said.He added: “The confusion you have created has raised serious questions as to what level of involvement there has been in the design and costing of this proposed scheme among ministers and officials at the Ministry of Defence.”Mr Healey lashed out at the £2.5bn costing of the scheme, saying the confusion reinforced doubts about whether the figure was a realistic estimate.“This is the flagship policy of the Conservative manifesto - the very first announcement that Rishi Sunak made during the election campaign - so we would expect the government to be absolutely clear how much it will cost, and how it will work, rather than both those questions being thrown up in the air by your comments over the last week,” the senior Labour figure said.“The Tories National Service pledge is an undeliverable plan and a distraction from their failures in defence over the last 14 years. With confusion over where people will be accommodated and how long they’ll serve, the Tories seem to be making it up as they go along,” he added.It is only the latest criticism of the policy, which has been panned by the former head of the Royal Navy, Admiral Lord West, and other senior military figures.Lord West, who was First Sea Lord from 2002 to 2006, warned that “anyone with the most basic experience of how much it costs, and what it entails, to turn a new recruit into someone that can usefully serve in our armed forces would not need a royal commission to tell them that the proposal as currently presented is utter nonsense”.“This ill-thought out conscription scheme will increase pressure on defence and waste money,” the former Navy chief wrote, adding: “Rather than enhancing our defence capability, it would further reduce it.”The Conservatives were asked to comment.",Sunak under fresh pressure over national service plan as Tories accused of ‘making it up as they go along’,8,9

262,"Sir Keir Starmer has opened the door to tax rises for millions of Britons by defining a working person as someone who relies on public services and doesn’t have savings.The Labour leader has repeatedly ruled out putting up taxes on what he calls “working people” who he says have borne the brunt of the cost of living crisis.Asked what he meant by the term, he said it refers to “people who earn their living, rely on our services and don’t really have the ability to write a cheque when they get into trouble”.His definition means millions of Britons including pensioners, savers, and those who use private services like healthcare may not be covered by his tax rise pledge.Senior Tories said the remarks showed that Sir Keir was preparing to “wallop” savers and homeowners with tax hikes, warning: “Be very afraid.”Iain Duncan Smith said Sir Keir had made 'a big admission' - Carl Court/GettyLabour has promised not to raise rates of income tax, national insurance or VAT for at least five years if it wins power, but has refused to rule out other tax rises.Sir Keir would not rule out a hike in council tax on Tuesday, saying that he could not “sit here two weeks before the election and write the budgets for the next five years”.But he said he had been “really clear we’re not going to be raising tax on working people” and that “none of our plans require tax rises over and above the ones we’ve set out”.Asked what he meant by working people, the Labour leader replied: “The person I have in my mind when I say working people is people who earn their living, rely on our services and don’t really have the ability to write a cheque when they get into trouble.“So the sort of people I’m meeting pretty well every day now. It’s quite a big group because these days there are many people obviously not so well-off.”‘Bills are bearing down’He gave the example of a woman he met in Southampton who has “got one job, she’s trying to get another job, and the bills are still bearing down on her”.“That’s the sort of person I have in my mind’s eye,” he added.Sir Iain Duncan Smith, a former Tory leader, said: “How unbelievable to say those who generate wealth, who work hard, who are successful, who add huge value to the British economy, to dismiss them completely.“They are his targets for higher taxation. If you have savings, if you own a home, if you own wealth, you are going to get walloped. That is a big admission.“His levelling-up isn’t levelling-up, it’s levelling-down. The old socialist in there who supported Jeremy Corbyn is still alive and well.”Less than £1,000 savingsThere are 11 million working-age people in Britain who have less than £1,000 in savings according to a recent Resolution Foundation report.That figure is typically considered to be the minimum “rainy day” contingency fund needed to cover unexpected costs that may crop up in life.But that still means two in three working households do have what could be considered sufficient savings to not qualify as “working people” under Sir Keir’s definition.On top of that one in eight Britons now rely on private health insurance, according to a survey carried out by pollsters YouGov last year.Private school VATThe parents of 615,000 children who are privately educated are already facing having to fork out thousands more when VAT is applied to private school fees.Then there are the 12.5 million retirees who on the current trajectory face being taxed on the state pension for the first time from 2027 under a Labour government.Sir Keir’s comments also imply that people who own substantial assets, such as the 2.8 million landlords in the UK, would also not be considered working people.",Starmer leaves door open to tax rises for millions as he defines ‘working people’,8,11
101,"Keir Starmer has committed to a judge-led inquiry into the Nottingham attacks if Labour wins the election, saying there are “too many examples of victims and family members being let down”.Barnaby Webber, Grace O’Malley-Kumar and Ian Coates were stabbed to death last year by Valdo Calocane, who was sentenced to a hospital order after pleading guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility due to paranoid schizophrenia.Barnaby’s mother, Emma Webber, directly challenged Starmer during a listener phone-in on LBC.She asked him: “If you do get into Downing Street, what are your thoughts about following through with the call for a public inquiry, or possibly a jury and judge-led inquest?“And also your thoughts please on the urgent need to reform our homicide laws and also the victim support in this country? Which from bitter experience, I can confirm is woeful and very inadequate.”The Labour leader replied that the families had been through a “horrific experience” as he committed to holding a judge-led inquiry if Labour win.“She wants a judge-led inquiry and I said when I met her that I thought that was the right way forward, and we would do that,” he said.“I was very concerned when I heard from her directly about the way the system had let her and the other family members down in relation to the charges that were brought, the communications with the family, and so many other aspects.”He said listening to what the families had been through was “really difficult”.“My resolve is to ensure that we have that inquiry and make sure that that doesn’t happen to anyone else. I’ve had too many examples of victims and family members being let down. We have to improve here,” Starmer said.Calocane killed the university students O’Malley-Kumar and Webber, both 19, and Coates, a 65-year-old school caretaker, and ran over three other people in a spate of violence in Nottingham last June.Following Calocane’s sentencing hearing in January, Webber said “true justice has not been served”. He was handed a hospital order and not jailed.His sentence was deemed unduly lenient by the attorney general, who referred it to the court of appeal, where lawyers argued Calocane should be given a hybrid order, under which he would be sent to prison if deemed fit enough to be discharged from hospital. The application was rejected.The families of the victims have long been calling for a public inquiry to investigate the missed opportunities to stop Calocane before the attacks.Sanjoy Kumar, the father of Grace O’Malley-Kumar, said: “We have to have a public inquiry. These individual investigations that have been set up will not change legislation, and they will not change the status quo.”Starmer previously backed their calls, saying earlier this year: “I think somebody outside of this, independent, needs to look at exactly what happened, what were the points at which there could have been an intervention and why it didn’t happen. That is the least that these families are owed.”",Keir Starmer commits to judge-led inquiry into Nottingham killings,8,8
180,"Rishi Sunak attends the plenary session of the Summit on peace in Ukraine, at the luxury Burgenstock resort, near Lucerne. URS FLUEELER via Getty ImagesWith a little over two weeks until the general election, one thing is becoming more apparent every day. The opinion polls are not shifting and the level of panic in Tory headquarters is becoming more acute.The first signs of this came last week, when Grant Shapps raised the possibility of Labour winning a “super-majority”.Leaving aside the question of how that is different from a normal majority, the defence secretary appeared to be conceding that Keir Starmer is not on course to win, but to win big.The Tory campaign was no longer about trying to get Rishi Sunak re-elected prime minister, but about trying to limit the size of the seemingly inevitable Labour victory.Although the PM himself said all the right things about fighting for every vote, if anything, the Tory campaign has become even more desperate this week.Responding to yesterday’s launch of Reform UK’s election manifesto, a Conservative spokesperson warned that a vote for Nigel Farage’s party could put Labour in power for a “generation” - widely considered to be at least 15 years.Farming minister Mark Spencer doubled down on that outlandish prediction this morning by insisting Labour could be in government for 20 years if it wins on July 4 and then implements plans to give 16 and 17-year-olds the vote.Shapps, meanwhile, who polls suggest is on course to lose his seat next month, conceded yesterday that a Labour victory was now “likely”.Tory chairman Richard Holden got in on the act last night, raising the prospect of a “big Labour majority” in an attempt to scare voters into backing the Conservatives.In yet another sign of desperation, the Tories are also rolling out Boris Johnson - who was forced to resign as PM in disgrace following partygate and the Chris Pincher scandal - in a last-ditch attempt to save some seats.He has put his name to thousands of Tory election leaflets urging voters who backed him in 2019 not to desert the party this time around.Responding to that development, Starmer told LBC this morning: “They started off saying vote Tory because they were going to win, then they said vote Tory because Labour’s going to win, now they’re saying something about Boris Johnson.“Honestly, if you can’t even have a strategy that holds for six weeks, you really don’t deserve to win.”According to The Sunday Times, senior Tories are urging Sunak to “go for the jugular” in the final fortnight of the campaign by being relentlessly negative about the prospects of a Keir Starmer government.But speaking on his Political Currency podcast, former Tory chancellor George Osborne said that would be a “disaster”.“He needs to just do what he’s doing, which is continue to show energy and enthusiasm and commitment and do the best he can,” he said.“One thing I would not do is take the advice of various people in the Tory Party - terrible advice - which is to switch and become the lead negative campaigner for the Conservatives against Keir Starmer.“That would be a disaster for the party but also a disaster for him.”Related...Not Sure Who To Vote For, But Don't Want The Tories?

265,"Sir Keir Starmer has refused to rule out changes to council tax rates in his plans for government, as he mocked rumours that the Tories will lean on Boris Johnson to prop up their ailing general election campaign.Pressed by LBC about his plans for council tax, the Labour leader said he would not “write the budgets for the next five years”.And he mocked claims that the ex-prime minister – on holiday in Italy – could soon feature in the Tory campaign, joking that the move was a “third or fourth relaunch” of the Conservative election strategy, adding: “If you can’t even have a strategy that holds for six weeks you really don’t deserve to win.”Elsewhere, nearly two thirds of voters said they felt confident that the Conservatives could not afford the policies set out in their manifesto, according to a poll.An Ipsos survey found that some 62 per cent of respondents were not convinced that all the pledges outlined in the document were fully costed.Key PointsKeir Starmer refuses to rule out council tax risesTories in talks for Johnson to return to campaign trail amid Farage threat62% say Tory manifesto pledges don’t add up – pollLabour could be in power for 20 years, warns Tory ministerFarage told manifesto is ‘unserious’ due to £141bn extra spending planLib Dems share no values with Reform UK, says Sir Ed DaveyBoris Johnson pulled into Tory campaign with personalised letters to voters - but may still snub Rishi Sunak13:30 , Andy GregoryBoris Johnson has been pulled in to help the crisis-hit Conservative election campaign – but he still might snub Rishi Sunak.In recent days he has filmed a series of cameo-style videos for individual Tory candidates who have loyally stood by him over the years – including one who tried to oust Mr Sunak.Now he has been parachuted into the disastrous Conservative election campaign, as it tries to fight off the threat from Nigel Farage. Letters exhorting voters to back the Tories, signed by the ex-party leader, are due to land on tens of thousands of doorsteps later this week.But a spokesman for Mr Johnson would not be drawn on whether the letters would mention Mr Sunak, although he did describe them as “supportive”.Our Whitehall editor Kate Devlin has the exclusive report:Boris Johnson pulled into Tory campaign - but may still snub Rishi SunakScottish Labour opposes two child benefit cap – despite Starmer not planning to axe it13:12 , Andy GregoryScottish Labour is against the two child benefit cap, Anas Sarwar has said, despite there being no plans to scrap the measure if Labour wins the keys to Downing Street.Asked at his party’s manifesto launch if he was against the cap – which only allows families to claim benefits for two children – Mr Sarwar said: “The short answer is yes.“We were right to oppose the two child limit, we were right to vote against the two child limit.”But he added: “The honest reality is after 14 years of Tory economic carnage, we will not be able to do everything we want to do as fast as we want to do.”Scottish Labour sets out targets if it wins 2026 Holyrood elections12:59 , Andy GregoryAnas Sarwar has laid out his party’s targets if it wins the 2026 Holyrood election, as he warned that change for Scotland was a “two stage process” which will culminate at the election in two years’ time.Speaking as his party launched their manifesto in Edinburgh, Mr Sarwar said Scottish Labour would improve policing, reform the planning system, ban second jobs for MSPs and bring in a recall mechanism and reduce the poverty-related attainment gap in education.He would also ensure the NHS was secure for “generations to come”, he said.Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar will unveil his party’s manifesto on Tuesday (Stefan Rousseau/PA) (PA Wire)General election polls: Are Labour or the Conservatives on track to win in July?12:43 , Andy GregoryThe Independent’s political data correspondent Alicja Hagopian has the latest general election polling here:General election polls: Are Labour or the Conservatives on track to win in July?Politics Explained | Does tactical voting mean the Tories are even less likely to win?12:25 , Lauren MacDougallVoters could swing the election further in Labour’s favour by boxing clever in marginal seats, writes Sean O’Grady.“As the first postal ballots are cast, there seems little doubt that, if the polls are correct and remain roughly where they are until polling day, the Labour Party will command a majority in the new House of Commons.“Such is the prospective scale of the swing from the Conservatives to Labour since the 2019 general election that it seems a foregone conclusion, a factor that may affect turnout and, thus, the size of that majority.“Yet such is the anti-Conservative mood that there are also strong indications that more of the electorate are prepared to vote tactically at this general election than at any since the New Labour triumphs in 1997 and 2001.

I never thought it was a good idea to get rid of him. And a lot of people in marginal seats maybe secretly – and they won’t go public – might wish that Boris Johnson was still leading them. Because frankly, in my view, they’d have a better chance of winning those seats.“But the party made its decisions, it got rid of Boris and I think we’re going to pay the price for that.”Starmer mocks Tories over Boris Johnson relaunch claims11:54 , Andy GregorySir Keir Starmer has mocked claims that the Tories will again turn to Boris Johnson for help with their ailing general election campaign.Speaking to LBC after the Telegraph reported that thousands of voters would receive signed letters from the ex-prime minister in a new campaign drive, Sir Keir joked that the move was a “third or fourth relaunch” of the Conservative election strategy.“If you can’t even have a strategy that holds for six weeks you really don’t deserve to win,” the Labour leader said.Full report: Farage claims Reform UK has been ‘stitched up’ over candidate vetting11:51 , Matt MathersNigel Farage has accused a vetting company of “stitching up” Reform UK after a series of candidates were found to have made inappropriate comments online.The Reform leader said his party paid “a large sum of money” for a reputable firm to run background checks on its general election candidates.Full report:Farage claims Reform UK has been ‘stitched up’ over candidate vettingSir Keir Starmer defines ‘working people’: They earn a living, rely on public services and can’t cut a cheque when things go wrong11:31 , Matt MathersSir Keir Starmer defines ‘working people’: They earn a living, rely on public services and can’t cut a cheque when things go wrong, Archie Mitchell reports.Sir Keir Starmer has fleshed out what he means when he promises taxes will not go up for “working people”.Asked what he means by the term, the Labour leader said: “When I say working people I mean people who earn a living, rely on our public services and don’t really have the ability to write a cheque when they get into trouble… so the sort of people I am meeting pretty well every day now.”He added: “It’s quite a big group because these days there are many people who are not so well off or even better off these days… it is important in politics who you have in your minds eye and I have all those people.”Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer was asked about future changes to council tax, as he took questions on LBC radio (Aaron Chown/PA) (PA Wire)General Election 2024: How do I vote on July 4 and when is the deadline to register?11:11 , Matt MathersRegistering to vote can be done online or with a paper form.In England and Northern Ireland you can register to vote from 16, while in Wales and Scotland it’s 14.However, you must be 18 on polling day to vote in a general election.Labour rules out 10 per cent tax on football transfers11:01 , Matt MathersLabour has ruled out levying a 10 per cent tax on football transfers a day after a frontbencher said the party would consider the move, Archie Mitchell reports.Asked about the 10 per cent levy, proposed as part of Tracey Crouch’s fan-led review of football governance, shadow culture and sport secretary Thangam Debbonaire said: “I’m going to look at absolutely everything that might help increase the financial sustainability.”But, asked about it by LBC’s Nick Ferrari on Tuesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: “Let me just kill that dead, we are not looking at that, that is not part of our plans for football governance.“We will get that football governance bill in, it is much-needed for fans, but that is not part of it.”Keir Starmer admires Rishi Sunak for bipartisan approach on Ukraine and security10:52 , Matt MathersKeir Starmer admires Rishi Sunak for bipartisan approach on Ukraine and security, Archie Mitchell reports.Sir Keir Starmer has praised Rishi Sunak’s approach to issues such as Ukraine and national security.The Labour leader was asked what, if anything, he admires about the prime minister.He told LBC’s Nick Ferrari: “On the day he became prime minister, he insisted on picking up the phone to me - which he did not have to.“In a personal one-to-one, he was running late for time and was really busy, he wanted to establish contact and say that on things like Ukraine and national security, whatever other arguments we have in other parts of the forest, we will work together and share information.“And to be fair, I have had pretty high level security briefings on Ukraine and other issues from him and his team.”Sir Keir added: “We will fight hard in this campaign, I do not think he should continue as prime minister, but I respect the fact that on a busy day he took the time to and insisted on making sure we had that call the day he was appointed.”Sunak with Zelensky (PA Wire)Starmer ‘frustrated’ with performance in ITV debate with Sunak10:42 , Matt MathersSir Keir Starmer has admitted he was “frustrated” with his performance in his TV debate against Rishi Sunak.The Labour leader said he would have liked more time to answer questions during a grilling by the ITV’s Julie Etchingham.“After the first debate I was slightly frustrated because I didn’t think the 45 seconds to answer your question really worked for me … I was pretty frustrated,” he told LBC.“ I’m not good company when I’m in that place.

39,"Britain will head to the polls on July 4 after prime minister Rishi Sunak called a snap general election at the end of May.June has seen intense vote-garnering efforts from all political parties as leaders chat, debate, and even paddle across the country to win over as many as possible. All parties have now revealed their election manifestos, laying out their vision for the country.Current polling would suggest things are not looking good for the Conservatives, with most trackers firmly putting Labour an average 20 points ahead of the governing party.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak during a visit to Cambridge Rugby Club in Cambridge (Joe Giddens/PA Wire)However, recent research by campaign group Best for Britain shows that 36 per cent of people are undecided in some constituencies. In more bad news for the government, the group has also identified 451 ‘tactical voting seats’ where voters have the best chance of ousting the Tories.Here’s everything you need to know about tactical voting and how important it could be in the upcoming general election:What is tactical voting?Tactical voting is when a voter casts their ballot for the candidate they believe is most likely to defeat another party’s candidate (usually the Conservatives), even if this candidate is not necessarily their first choice.Some see this as a necessary practice due to the UK’s ‘First Past The Post’ (FPTP) voting system. Under FPTP, it is the candidate who gets the most votes that wins.It may seem like the most democratic system to decide a winner at first glance, but many argue that FPTP does not always produce results that reflect the political leanings of the area.This is because some parties are much more politically aligned than others. For instance, in areas where the votes for Labour and the Liberal Democrats outweigh that for the Conservative candidate, but neither beat them alone, the Conservative candidate wins.Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer on the General Election campaign trail on Thursday (Gareth Fuller/PA Wire)However, the results would indicate that the majority of voters in this area support more progressive, left-wing or centre-left politicians.Groups such as the Electoral Reform Society (ERS) campaign to change this, pointing out that the MPs elected to parliament rarely reflect the popular vote.For instance, at the 2019 general election, 11.5 per cent of people voted for the Liberal Democrats, but they only secured 1.7 per cent of seats. The Conservatives’ 43.6 per cent, on the other hand, translated to 56.2 per cent of seats.The ERS promotes voting systems that are designed to tackle this issue, such as the Single Transferable Vote or Alternative Vote where voters can rank candidates by preference.However, in 2011 the UK was given a referendum on switching the way people vote to the Alternative Vote system, where the votes against it were nearly 68 per cent.Where has tactical voting been recommended?Ahead of polling day, campaign group Best for Britain has produced a list of tactical voting recommendations for voters who are keen to see the Tories ousted from government.The group recommends 451 candidates across the UK, around 70 per cent of MPs. These comprise 370 seats for Labour, 69 for the Lib Dems, seven for the SNP, three for the Greens and two for Plaid Cymru.Amongst the many seats targeted are those of Jacob Rees-Mogg (North East Somerset), Liz Truss (South West Norfolk) and Suella Braverman (Fareham and Waterlooville).If tactical voting was carried out according to their plan, Best for Britain project the Conservatives could wake up to as few as 45 seats on July 5, an astounding loss of 320. Meanwhile, Labour would take an average of 445, gaining 243.Does tactical voting work? Tactical voting could work, if it was carried out en masse. However, despite talk of tactical voting at most major elections, there is little evidence that it has made a significant impact in the past.There are many seats in the UK where a sustained tactical vote campaign would have changed the final result. For instance, in the 2023 Uxbridge by-election, the Conservatives secured 13,965 votes, while Labour secured 13,470.Meanwhile, the Greens gained 893 votes, coming in third. If all these votes were instead tactically given to Labour, it would have been a victory for the party in Boris Johnson’s former seat.It is a similar story for the seat of Somerset North East, held by Jacob Rees-Mogg since 2010. In 2019, Mr Rees-Mogg secured 28,360 votes, while Labour and the Lib Dems combined secured 26,053.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey (Joe Giddens/PA) (PA Wire)It is possible a combined effort could’ve secured the seat for either party, although neither has assented to a tactical voting pact in the past.However, the Lib Dems won the seat of Somerton and Frome for the first time since 2010 in last year’s by-election, with tactical voting thought to be a major factor. The Labour vote share had dwindled from 12.9 per cent in 2019, to just 2.6.“It is no secret that some Labour and Green party voters lent us their votes in Somerset and we are very grateful for their support,” said Lib Dem leader Ed Davey.“In many seats across the south-west, voters at the next election will be faced with a similar choice between the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives.”What impact could tactical voting have on the 2024 General Election?Polling experts have said an increase in tactical voting is “bad news for the Conservative Party”, but there may still be some three-way marginal seats between the Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems.Chris Hopkins, political research director at leading polling consultancy Savanta, told The Independent: ""Voters have got increasingly sophisticated in understanding how in a first past the post system, their vote can be as effective as possible.“In particular this is bad news for the Conservative Party, where there will be plenty of natural Labour supporters in the South West who will back the Lib Dems, as they know they are their best chance of getting rid of the Tories.""That being said, because of the forecasted size of the swing from Conservative to Labour, there are some three-way marginals where Labour and the Lib Dems may be unwilling to step aside. That could mean voters are told different things about who is 'most likely to win here', and could lead to split, enabling some Conservative MPs to hold on.""Prime Minister Rishi Sunak during a General Election campaign event at ExCeL London (Stefan Rousseau/PA) (PA Wire)Campaigners have also added tactical voting will help deliver a “progressive government”, but warned the first-past-the-post system (FPTP) must be changed to better represent voting intentions.Neal Lawson, executive director at Compass, told The Independent: “We desperately need a progressive government, and tactical voting will no doubt play a vital role in helping to deliver one - but voting tactically without conditions only entrenches the pendulum politics that grinds us all down and alienates voters from the political process.“The worry is that without a commitment to changing the system, tactical voting enshrines the abusive nature of First Past the Post and forces voters to continue voting tactically forever more.“If Labour does win the next election on the back of lent votes, they should commit to getting rid of FPTP and replacing it with a system that can better represent the progressive majority that already exists in this country.”Naomi Smith, CEO of Best for Britain and founder of tactical voting platform, GetVoting.org, said: “Our polling shows 13 million Brits are ready to vote tactically for change, and these voters will be key to a defeat that would keep the Tories out for a decade and the difference between deliverance or defeat for the likes of Rishi Sunak, Jeremy Hunt and Liz Truss.“Best for Britain will be helping voters get it right at GetVoting.org with expert constituency level insights and voting recommendations before polling day.”",What is tactical voting and where has it been encouraged in the 2024 general election?,8,9
36,"Boris Johnson is being drafted in by the Tories to play a more active role in the election campaign as the party seeks to counter the threat from Reform UK.Tens of thousands of letters signed by the former prime minister, who has been pictured on holiday in Italy, are due to be delivered to voters later this week, The Telegraph can reveal.It comes after the Conservatives warned that a vote for Reform risked putting Labour in power for “a generation”.The direct mail drive urging people to vote Tory is Mr Johnson’s closest involvement yet in the Conservatives’ attempts to defy the polls.The Prime Minister and Boris Johnson once had a close relationship, but it became increasingly strained after Rishi Sunak's resignation as chancellor in 2022 - Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesAmong those voters believed to have been targeted are wavering Tories who backed the party when Mr Johnson was leader but are now tempted by Reform.On Monday, the Conservatives issued their starkest warning over Nigel Farage’s party yet after the Reform manifesto launch, saying: “If you’re thinking about voting for Reform, and a generation under Labour scares you, there’s only one way to prevent it: vote Conservative.”In the last fortnight, there have been discussions about Mr Johnson appearing in person on the campaign trail to boost the party’s fortunes.He has not been in the UK, however, with Carrie Johnson, Mr Johnson’s wife, posting pictures on her Instagram on Monday night of the family on holiday in “beautiful Sardinia”.Photos show the former prime minister relaxing on a beach with his wife and children on the Italian coast.Carrie Johnson posted a holiday photo on InstagramIsaac Levido, the Tory campaign manager who also ran his 2019 election bid, is known to admire his former boss’s communication skills. Mr Levido and Mr Johnson have been in regular contact during the campaign, including about how the former prime minister could help out.But it remains unclear how much Mr Johnson is willing to do to support Mr Sunak, a man many of his allies still blame for his ousting from Downing Street.Mr Sunak’s resignation as chancellor in July 2022 triggered a ministerial stampede for the exit door, with Mr Johnson resigning 36 hours later.So far, Mr Johnson has limited his campaign role to video endorsements for individual MPs who have asked for them, and pro-Tory columns in the Daily Mail. But those articles often make no explicit mention of Mr Sunak, and the video support messages made public so far have tended to be for loyal allies.On Monday, another campaign video by Mr Johnson was released in which he urges people to vote for Alice Hopkin, the Tory candidate in Normanton and Hemsworth, to avoid handing Labour a ‘super majority’. He urges voters: “Don’t let Starmer get away with it.”Mr Sunak and Mr Johnson have not talked during the campaign, according to one Johnson ally, suggesting their relationship has not fully healed. They had shared texts about Israel-Gaza policy issues the day before the snap election was called.One ally of Mr Johnson told The Telegraph he was still weighing up whether to campaign in person. Asked why the Tory campaign wanted to deploy him, the source said: “The simple answer is he gets cut through. That is a rarity in this Conservative campaign.”Sources in both the Tory campaign and close to Mr Johnson dismissed any suggestion there was friction between the two camps. They stressed Mr Johnson had not turned down any specific offer to join a campaign event.One idea had been that that he would campaign in Red Wall seats that he won in 2019. In the past, his allies have said Mr Sunak would have to call and ask for his help.With limited time before the election, Mr Johnson’s overseas commitments complicate the situation. He travels abroad again this week and is due to return only shortly before polling day.He sees himself as an election winner and he may be reluctant to appear as part of a campaign facing defeat, especially should he ever wish to launch a political comeback. One ally predicted that he would not end up doing an in-person campaign event.The Tories are still trailing Labour by around 20 percentage points in the polls with less than three weeks before the general election on July 4. Some polling analysis suggests they could be left with under 100 MPs.Mr Sunak, under pressure after months without improvement in the polls, has faced calls from some Tories to “go for the jugular” in attacks on Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader.The campaign is now also talking up the prospect of a Labour “super-majority” to sway voters back to the Tories. But Mr Sunak has avoided personally talking about that possibility, insisting he can still win the election.A spokesman for Mr Johnson said: “Boris Johnson has always said ‘vote Conservative’ at every election, and he continues to say that this time.”",Tories turn to Boris Johnson to counter Reform,8,11
140,"Nigel Farage has parked his tank firmly on Rishi Sunak’s lawn with a manifesto designed to win over disgruntled Tory supporters and an extraordinary prediction he will be prime minister after the 2029 election.Launching Reform UK’s so-called “contract with the people”, the arch-Brexiteer appealed directly to right-wing voters with policies including a freeze on non-essential immigration, scrapping net zero targets and pulling Britain out of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).His controversial pledges came as one prospective candidate was forced to stand down over historical comments urging people to vote BNP, while another described Adolf Hitler as “brilliant”.Jack Aaron, who is standing against defence secretary Grant Shapps in Welwyn Hatfield, made comments online praising Hitler’s “brilliant tactics”, while Syrian president Bashar-al Assad was “gentle by nature”.While right-wingers revelled in Reform UK’s wishlist of pledges, economists and experts ripped it apart for its fantasy economics and dangerous high-carbon anti-net zero policies.Sam Fankhauser, professor of climate economics and policy at the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, University of Oxford, told The Independent: “Reform UK would like Britain to be a high-carbon island in a low-carbon world, missing out on 21st-century technology, innovation and growth. Our own research shows that the UK can meet its 2030 net zero targets with just six to eight billion pounds of additional public sector investment a year – a small price to pay for a liveable planet.”Meanwhile, the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) concluded that Reform’s sums “do not add up”.Reform UK chairman Richard Tice (left) and party leader Nigel Farage launch ‘Our Contract with You’ in Merthyr Tydfil on Monday (PA)IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson said the party’s planned spending cuts, such as its £50bn crackdown on “wasteful government spending”, would save less than stated, while the proposed tax cuts would cost tens of billions of pounds more.He added: “Even with the extremely optimistic assumptions about how much economic growth would increase, the sums in this manifesto do not add up. While Reform’s manifesto gives a clear sense of priority, a government could only implement parts of this package, or would need to find other ways to help pay for it, which would mean losers not specified.”The impact of Mr Farage on the campaign was underlined again as a Redfield and Wilton poll put Reform level with the Tories on 18 per cent, both well behind Labour on 43 per cent.But it all came as anti-Brexit campaign group Best for Britain said Labour could stop Mr Farage in his tracks with a potential victory in Clacton if the electorate votes tactically.Speaking ahead of the launch, the Reform leader said he was “launching a crusade to defend British values” and that the location was chosen “because it shows everyone exactly what happens to a country when Labour is in charge”.In a sign that Reform’s policy document was not a serious programme for government, Mr Farage opened the event in Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales, with an admission: “I’m not going to pretend we’re going to win.”Instead, he announced that the policies were issues his party planned to pursue in his self-appointed role as the “opposition to Labour” as part of a campaign to ensure he is prime minister after the 2029 election.Mr Farage lashed out at the soaring tax burden, touting £90bn per year worth of tax cuts for voters and a shake-up that would take 7 million people out of paying tax on their earnings altogether.Click here for our live coverage of the general election campaign.The manifesto launch comes just days after Reform overtook the Tories for the first time in a national poll. It is still expected to win just one seat, with Mr Farage standing in Clacton, but threatens to deprive the Tories of majorities in tens of seats across the country.In a sign of increasing panic over the rise of Reform in the polls, a Conservative Party spokesperson responded to the manifesto launch by saying a vote for Reform “risks delivering an unaccountable Labour majority”.They added: “That would hand Keir Starmer a blank cheque to raise your taxes, take no action on illegal immigration, and even rejoin the EU, with no way to stop him.”And the Tories warned that if Labour got in, it would remain in power for a generation.Nigel Farage was criticised for spending more in the Reform UK manifesto than Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-Budget (PA Archive)Reform said its manifesto pledges would cost £141bn to implement, setting out proposals to save £146bn to fund them.Tax expert Dan Neidle immediately noted that at least £38bn of Reform’s tax cuts were unfunded, about twice the unfunded cost of Liz Truss’s disastrous 2022 mini-Budget.But Mr Farage insisted the document showed “radical, fresh, outside-the-box thinking”.He said: “It’s not what you’re going to get from the current Labour and Conservative parties who are virtually indistinguishable, frankly, from each other.“Is this radical fresh thinking on economics? Yes. Is it radical fresh thinking on constitutional change? Yes. Is it a very radical change in the way our education system is currently bringing up our young children? Yes.”And, in a sign of Mr Farage’s package appealing to traditional Tory backers, the usually Conservative-supporting Taxpayers’ Alliance said the manifesto offered Brits “real relief”.Mr Farage addressed criticism of the cost of the package by saying the party would merely be campaigning for the measures over five years as the voice of opposition to an expected Labour government.The manifesto also delved into the so-called culture wars, promising a ban on “transgender ideology” in schools with “gender questioning, social transitioning and pronoun swapping” prohibited.Nigel Farage signs a copy of his party’s manifesto following its launch in Merthyr Tydfil (PA Wire)It also proposed a “patriotic curriculum”, which would include pairing the teaching of Britain’s history of slavery or European imperialism, with a non-European occurrence to “ensure balance”.Reform promised to make St George’s Day and St David’s Day public holidays, pledged a Free Speech Bill to “stop left-wing bias and politically correct ideology” and said it would scrap the TV licence, which funds the BBC. It also vowed to fast-track North Sea oil and gas licences.Mr Farage added that Reform wants to “simplify” the UK’s tax system, which it says totals more than 21,000 pages, while Hong Kong’s is 500 pages.The party is also proposing to lift the minimum profit threshold to £100,000 and reduce the main corporation tax rate from 25 per cent to 15 per cent in three years, which it says would “free” 1.2 million businesses.Elsewhere, it promises to abolish business rates for small and medium businesses by introducing an “online delivery tax” of 4 per cent for large companies.Mr Farage’s party also pledges to cut fuel duty by 20p per litre, scrap VAT on energy bills, scrap stamp duty on sales below £750,000 and ditch income tax for those earning less than £20,000.The document also states that inheritance tax would be scrapped for 98 per cent of all estates.",Nigel Farage pledges to run for PM in 2029 as Reform manifesto slated by economists,8,9
347,"There is a famous internet meme in which David Beckham twice tells a dissembler to “be honest” before finally saying “thank you” after procuring a damning admission. It came readily to mind during Keir Starmer’s performance on LBC this morning, when he was asked if he would have served in Jeremy Corbyn’s Cabinet had Labour won the 2019 election.Starmer said the dilemma hadn’t crossed his mind “because I didn’t think we would win”. Then he branded the question “hypothetical”. Finally he admitted: “If we had got it over the line there were important things that I thought needed to be done from the frontbench.”Thank you. So that’s a “yes” then. This restyled Mr Moderate would have propped up the same former candidate for prime minister that he today damns as having been unfit to run Britain.Not only did he describe Corbyn as having the makings of “a great prime minister” during the 2019 campaign, but he also called his one-time boss a “friend” on multiple occasions, including during the 2020 leadership contest in which he was keen to come across as a Left-wing candidate. Starmer appears to have devised the “I knew we would lose” idea much later as a way of rationalising his own conduct to himself.One even feels a certain amount of sympathy for Corbyn’s hurt feelings when he observed of Starmer’s repositioning: “Well he never said that to me at any time. So I just think rewriting history is no help. It shows double standards, shall we say.”There can be no doubt that Starmer’s current line on Corbyn is the correct judgment. After all, who can forget Corbyn’s response after Russian special agent staged a chemical attack in Salisbury that ultimately killed a British citizen?In March 2018, he pressed then Prime Minister Theresa May to explain: “How has she responded to the Russian government’s request for a sample used in the Salisbury attack, to run its own tests?” The ludicrous implication was that he thought the Kremlin could be relied upon to truthfully say whether the nerve agent deployed had originated in Russia or not.On that occasion several Labour MPs, including Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn, intervened to support Mrs May against their own party leader. They spoke from the backbenches because they refused to serve under Corbyn.Starmer was by then one of Corbyn’s most important lieutenants, charged as Shadow Brexit Secretary with steering Labour’s approach to leaving the European Union. The plan he came up with, lest anyone forget, was to try and scrap Brexit via a second referendum, even though he had earlier promised that Labour would support the implementation of Brexit “as a matter of principle”.When it comes to the issue of people who are unfit to be prime minister of the United Kingdom, the only sensible conclusion about Starmer’s opinion of Corbyn should be: it takes one to know one",Keir Starmer’s original sin has come back to haunt him,8,11

More than half (51.77 per cent) said they did not believe their association was ready.

158,"Prime minister Rishi Sunak settled on 4 July for the general election after months of speculation. But while the economic news is good, with inflation coming down, the polls are still heavily against the Tories.The last general election was in 2019, when Boris Johnson and the Tories won 365 seats, while Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour won 202. Since then, both parties have switched leaders — in some cases, more than once — not to mention Brexit coming into effect and a worldwide Coronavirus pandemic.So what are the polls saying? If Mr Sunak was hoping to wait for the polls to swing in his favour before calling the election, he was sorely mistaken.The general public has been overall dissatisfied with both the prime minister and Sir Starmer, with Ipsos polls showing negative net satisfaction consistently for both party leaders since Mr Sunak entered No. 10 in November 2022.Mr Sunak’s approval rating fell to the ranks of lowest-ever for a prime minister in April, at -59 per cent approval; matched only by John Major in August 1994. This is lower than Liz Truss, whose net approval rating was at -51 per cent for her brief stint as prime minister.Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour has a 24-point lead in the latest poll on voter intentions from Techne UK, with the Tory-Labour gap remaining as wide as ever.After a dip in the polls following Mr Sunak’s election announcement, the Tories have made little gains with voters.At just 20 per cent of the vote, the Conservatives are still at one of their lowest levels of popularity with the electorate under Mr Sunak.Meanwhile Reform UK have shot up to 15 per cent of the national vote, after being neck-in-neck with the Lib Dems for the past few months, and gunning for the spot of third-highest polling party.Both parties appear to be picking up support from historical Tory voters.Labour have polled consistently in the region of 44 per cent and the Conservatives have been shedding more points since January.Although it is not entirely clear why Mr Sunak chose now to go to the polls, one in four people believe that the prime minister was hoping to benefit from recently improved inflation figures, according to a Redfield and Wilton poll for the Independent.If that is the case, the Tories have seen no joy when it comes to voter intention.The latest data is taken from 1,630 surveyed individuals across the UK, weighted to be representative of the population.Satisfaction with both Mr Sunak and Sir Keir remains poor, according to a separate monthly poll by Ipsos UK.The data is taken from 1,000 British adults surveyed each month, answering the question: “Are you satisfied/dissatisfied with how ... is doing his job as prime minister/as leader of the Labour Party?”Despite low figures overall, satisfaction has jumped for the Labour leader in the past month, with a 13-point boost from -31 per cent to -18 per cent.Mr Sunak saw a 5-point jump in the same period, from -59 per cent to -55 per cent. This puts Mr Starmer at a 37-point lead in net satisfaction.An exclusive Independent poll from Redfield and Wilton shows that the economy tops the list of issues that are most important to voters, at 37 per cent. With inflation finally slowing down (at 2.3 per cent as of May), the economy could be a key button for the Tories to press; if the general public can look beyond the past two years.Meanwhile, healthcare is the most important issue for 1 in 5 voters at this election, in the wake of widespread strikes, pandemic strains, and scandals across the NHS including the infected blood inquiry and sky-high waiting lists.Migration is also a dividing concern among voters, with both Labour and the Tories pledging to cut numbers.",General election polls: Are Labour or the Conservatives on track to win in July?,8,9
198,"Rishi Sunak has insisted the Tories can still win the General Election after Cabinet minister Grant Shapps said a Conservative victory is unlikely.The Prime Minister said he understands people’s frustrations but gave a more optimistic assessment of his party’s chances than the Defence Secretary, who said that to claim the Tories are on course for a win would be to “try and pretend black is white”.As the party continues to languish behind Labour in the polls, he said Sir Keir Starmer lacked “the courage of his convictions” and suggested his rival would find the job in Downing Street “hard to do well”.Asked during a huddle with journalists on the Tory battlebus about what he thought of his political opponent, the Prime Minister said: “What I’d say is Keir Starmer is someone who clearly doesn’t have the courage of his convictions.“He also is not prioritising investment in our country’s security. I think that is deeply concerning as someone who’s sat in this job for 18 months, at a time when the world is more dangerous and uncertain than it’s been since the end of the Cold War, having just come back from the G7 and a peace summit about Ukraine in Switzerland.“It’s obvious that the world is incredibly dangerous and for someone who wants to be prime minister of our country not to prioritise investing more our country’s security I find deeply concerning.”Mr Sunak’s comments came as Nigel Farage launched Reform UK’s “contract” with voters to add to the Conservatives’ woes.Labour has an average 20-point poll lead over the past week – on 41% ahead of the Tories on 21% and Reform on 15%.Speaking during a visit to a Centrica gas rig earlier on Monday, the Prime Minister said: “There’s still two-and-a-half weeks to go in this election, I’m fighting hard for every vote because I believe we can win.“And there’s a very clear choice at this election: it’s having your taxes cut by the Conservatives or facing significant tax rises with the Labour Party.”(PA Graphics)Asked if he understands people’s frustrations with the Tory Party, with some voters deciding to turn to Reform UK, he replied: “Of course I understand people’s frustrations with that – I mean that’s undeniable, and I’ve been very clear that we have made progress, but there is more to go.“But the point now is we are on the right track and this election is about the future.”Mr Shapps earlier told Times Radio it is “possible to win the election”, but conceded it is “not the most likely outcome”, adding: “I’m a realist.”Asked if a Tory victory is unlikely, he replied: “I think that’s the realistic position, isn’t it? I mean, I live in the real world. So, you know, let’s not try and pretend black is white.”Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer and shadow chancellor Rachel Reeve on a visit to Southampton (Stefan Rousseau/PA)Meanwhile, Labour accused Jeremy Hunt of “admitting” pledges in the Conservative manifesto are “completely unfunded” after the BBC reported the Chancellor last week said that promised tax cuts would be funded by savings from a back-to-work programme announced in the autumn statement.In a sign of the campaign intensifying as it enters its fourth week, shadow paymaster general Jonathan Ashworth put a copy of the Tory document into a shredder at a hastily arranged press conference in London, claiming that is what Mr Hunt had done to the Conservatives’ economic credibility.The Tories have set out plans for billions in tax cuts, which they claim would be paid for by £12 billion of savings on welfare.Mr Sunak’s visit to a Centrica platform in the North Sea came as Mr Farage was setting out Reform’s plans – which he suggested were the first step on the path to a potential election win in 2029.Mr Farage added: “Our ambition is to establish a bridgehead in Parliament, and to become a real opposition to a Labour government.”He said the Tories would not be able to provide opposition because “they spend most of their days arguing among themselves, and they’re split down the middle when it comes to policy”.In other developments:– Reform set out a four-point plan for immigration including: leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, allowing zero illegal immigrants to settle in the UK, establishing a new “Department of Immigration” and returning migrants who come over in boats to France.– Labour claimed Chancellor Jeremy Hunt had driven a “coach and horses” through the Tory’s manifesto promises by saying that a £12 billion squeeze on welfare which the Conservatives plan to use to fund tax cuts had already been announced and factored in to the existing government finances.– Scotland’s First Minister John Swinney said the SNP will include a social tariff on energy, broadband and mobile bills in its manifesto this week.Labour intends to spend the week focusing on its plans for the economy, with shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves joining Sir Keir on the campaign trail.Sir Keir used a visit to a port in Southampton to say that a renegotiated Brexit deal could remove “an inhibitor” to economic growth.Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves and shadow secretary of state for business and trade Jonathan Reynolds met business leaders on Monday morning at the start of a campaign week focusing on the economy (Lucy North/PA)He said: “We took a decision to leave the EU, so we are not going to go back in.

36,"Boris Johnson is being drafted in by the Tories to play a more active role in the election campaign as the party seeks to counter the threat from Reform UK.Tens of thousands of letters signed by the former prime minister, who has been pictured on holiday in Italy, are due to be delivered to voters later this week, The Telegraph can reveal.It comes after the Conservatives warned that a vote for Reform risked putting Labour in power for “a generation”.The direct mail drive urging people to vote Tory is Mr Johnson’s closest involvement yet in the Conservatives’ attempts to defy the polls.The Prime Minister and Boris Johnson once had a close relationship, but it became increasingly strained after Rishi Sunak's resignation as chancellor in 2022 - Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesAmong those voters believed to have been targeted are wavering Tories who backed the party when Mr Johnson was leader but are now tempted by Reform.On Monday, the Conservatives issued their starkest warning over Nigel Farage’s party yet after the Reform manifesto launch, saying: “If you’re thinking about voting for Reform, and a generation under Labour scares you, there’s only one way to prevent it: vote Conservative.”In the last fortnight, there have been discussions about Mr Johnson appearing in person on the campaign trail to boost the party’s fortunes.He has not been in the UK, however, with Carrie Johnson, Mr Johnson’s wife, posting pictures on her Instagram on Monday night of the family on holiday in “beautiful Sardinia”.Photos show the former prime minister relaxing on a beach with his wife and children on the Italian coast.Carrie Johnson posted a holiday photo on InstagramIsaac Levido, the Tory campaign manager who also ran his 2019 election bid, is known to admire his former boss’s communication skills. Mr Levido and Mr Johnson have been in regular contact during the campaign, including about how the former prime minister could help out.But it remains unclear how much Mr Johnson is willing to do to support Mr Sunak, a man many of his allies still blame for his ousting from Downing Street.Mr Sunak’s resignation as chancellor in July 2022 triggered a ministerial stampede for the exit door, with Mr Johnson resigning 36 hours later.So far, Mr Johnson has limited his campaign role to video endorsements for individual MPs who have asked for them, and pro-Tory columns in the Daily Mail. But those articles often make no explicit mention of Mr Sunak, and the video support messages made public so far have tended to be for loyal allies.On Monday, another campaign video by Mr Johnson was released in which he urges people to vote for Alice Hopkin, the Tory candidate in Normanton and Hemsworth, to avoid handing Labour a ‘super majority’. He urges voters: “Don’t let Starmer get away with it.”Mr Sunak and Mr Johnson have not talked during the campaign, according to one Johnson ally, suggesting their relationship has not fully healed. They had shared texts about Israel-Gaza policy issues the day before the snap election was called.One ally of Mr Johnson told The Telegraph he was still weighing up whether to campaign in person. Asked why the Tory campaign wanted to deploy him, the source said: “The simple answer is he gets cut through. That is a rarity in this Conservative campaign.”Sources in both the Tory campaign and close to Mr Johnson dismissed any suggestion there was friction between the two camps. They stressed Mr Johnson had not turned down any specific offer to join a campaign event.One idea had been that that he would campaign in Red Wall seats that he won in 2019. In the past, his allies have said Mr Sunak would have to call and ask for his help.With limited time before the election, Mr Johnson’s overseas commitments complicate the situation. He travels abroad again this week and is due to return only shortly before polling day.He sees himself as an election winner and he may be reluctant to appear as part of a campaign facing defeat, especially should he ever wish to launch a political comeback. One ally predicted that he would not end up doing an in-person campaign event.The Tories are still trailing Labour by around 20 percentage points in the polls with less than three weeks before the general election on July 4. Some polling analysis suggests they could be left with under 100 MPs.Mr Sunak, under pressure after months without improvement in the polls, has faced calls from some Tories to “go for the jugular” in attacks on Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader.The campaign is now also talking up the prospect of a Labour “super-majority” to sway voters back to the Tories. But Mr Sunak has avoided personally talking about that possibility, insisting he can still win the election.A spokesman for Mr Johnson said: “Boris Johnson has always said ‘vote Conservative’ at every election, and he continues to say that this time.”",Tories turn to Boris Johnson to counter Reform,7,11

I am concerned about the impact. I won't shy away from that.""But my message today is remember your ID when you go to vote this time round because it's so important that people who want change do vote for change.""Under rules introduced by the Conservatives in 2022, people eligible to vote have to produce some form of photo ID to cast their ballots.This general election is the first time photo ID is required everywhere nationally. Previous by-elections, local elections, and police and crime commissioner elections have required ID before.The changes were brought in to stamp out what the Conservative government claimed could potentially lead to high levels of voter fraud.But the Electoral Commission said the number of offences has been minimal and instead, there was a risk the policy could put people off voting.Read more:What counts as voter ID?Manifesto checker: What are the parties pledging?The Commission found 14,000 people were turned away during May's local elections for not having a required form of ID - including Boris Johnson who introduced the requirement.Of particular concern to campaigners is the risk of disproportionality to the policy.According to the elections watchdog's research, poorer people, disabled people and ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by the rules and may not have as much access to voting as the wider population.👉 Tap here to follow Politics at Jack and Sam's wherever you get your podcasts 👈The Lib Dems have promised to scrap the policy in their manifesto and Sir Keir today has made his strongest signal yet the policy may be scrapped under a Labour government.The current government's assessment of the cost of introducing the voter ID policy put the total as high as £120m over a decade.A former cabinet minister who pushed the bill through parliament claimed the policy did not work.Jacob Rees-Mogg said the plan had backfired on the Conservatives because many older people were the ones most often caught without the correct ID.",Sir Keir Starmer considering mandatory voter ID review,8,5
140,"Nigel Farage has parked his tank firmly on Rishi Sunak’s lawn with a manifesto designed to win over disgruntled Tory supporters and an extraordinary prediction he will be prime minister after the 2029 election.Launching Reform UK’s so-called “contract with the people”, the arch-Brexiteer appealed directly to right-wing voters with policies including a freeze on non-essential immigration, scrapping net zero targets and pulling Britain out of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).His controversial pledges came as one prospective candidate was forced to stand down over historical comments urging people to vote BNP, while another described Adolf Hitler as “brilliant”.Jack Aaron, who is standing against defence secretary Grant Shapps in Welwyn Hatfield, made comments online praising Hitler’s “brilliant tactics”, while Syrian president Bashar-al Assad was “gentle by nature”.While right-wingers revelled in Reform UK’s wishlist of pledges, economists and experts ripped it apart for its fantasy economics and dangerous high-carbon anti-net zero policies.Sam Fankhauser, professor of climate economics and policy at the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, University of Oxford, told The Independent: “Reform UK would like Britain to be a high-carbon island in a low-carbon world, missing out on 21st-century technology, innovation and growth. Our own research shows that the UK can meet its 2030 net zero targets with just six to eight billion pounds of additional public sector investment a year – a small price to pay for a liveable planet.”Meanwhile, the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) concluded that Reform’s sums “do not add up”.Reform UK chairman Richard Tice (left) and party leader Nigel Farage launch ‘Our Contract with You’ in Merthyr Tydfil on Monday (PA)IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson said the party’s planned spending cuts, such as its £50bn crackdown on “wasteful government spending”, would save less than stated, while the proposed tax cuts would cost tens of billions of pounds more.He added: “Even with the extremely optimistic assumptions about how much economic growth would increase, the sums in this manifesto do not add up. While Reform’s manifesto gives a clear sense of priority, a government could only implement parts of this package, or would need to find other ways to help pay for it, which would mean losers not specified.”The impact of Mr Farage on the campaign was underlined again as a Redfield and Wilton poll put Reform level with the Tories on 18 per cent, both well behind Labour on 43 per cent.But it all came as anti-Brexit campaign group Best for Britain said Labour could stop Mr Farage in his tracks with a potential victory in Clacton if the electorate votes tactically.Speaking ahead of the launch, the Reform leader said he was “launching a crusade to defend British values” and that the location was chosen “because it shows everyone exactly what happens to a country when Labour is in charge”.In a sign that Reform’s policy document was not a serious programme for government, Mr Farage opened the event in Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales, with an admission: “I’m not going to pretend we’re going to win.”Instead, he announced that the policies were issues his party planned to pursue in his self-appointed role as the “opposition to Labour” as part of a campaign to ensure he is prime minister after the 2029 election.Mr Farage lashed out at the soaring tax burden, touting £90bn per year worth of tax cuts for voters and a shake-up that would take 7 million people out of paying tax on their earnings altogether.Click here for our live coverage of the general election campaign.The manifesto launch comes just days after Reform overtook the Tories for the first time in a national poll. It is still expected to win just one seat, with Mr Farage standing in Clacton, but threatens to deprive the Tories of majorities in tens of seats across the country.In a sign of increasing panic over the rise of Reform in the polls, a Conservative Party spokesperson responded to the manifesto launch by saying a vote for Reform “risks delivering an unaccountable Labour majority”.They added: “That would hand Keir Starmer a blank cheque to raise your taxes, take no action on illegal immigration, and even rejoin the EU, with no way to stop him.”And the Tories warned that if Labour got in, it would remain in power for a generation.Nigel Farage was criticised for spending more in the Reform UK manifesto than Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-Budget (PA Archive)Reform said its manifesto pledges would cost £141bn to implement, setting out proposals to save £146bn to fund them.Tax expert Dan Neidle immediately noted that at least £38bn of Reform’s tax cuts were unfunded, about twice the unfunded cost of Liz Truss’s disastrous 2022 mini-Budget.But Mr Farage insisted the document showed “radical, fresh, outside-the-box thinking”.He said: “It’s not what you’re going to get from the current Labour and Conservative parties who are virtually indistinguishable, frankly, from each other.“Is this radical fresh thinking on economics? Yes. Is it radical fresh thinking on constitutional change? Yes. Is it a very radical change in the way our education system is currently bringing up our young children? Yes.”And, in a sign of Mr Farage’s package appealing to traditional Tory backers, the usually Conservative-supporting Taxpayers’ Alliance said the manifesto offered Brits “real relief”.Mr Farage addressed criticism of the cost of the package by saying the party would merely be campaigning for the measures over five years as the voice of opposition to an expected Labour government.The manifesto also delved into the so-called culture wars, promising a ban on “transgender ideology” in schools with “gender questioning, social transitioning and pronoun swapping” prohibited.Nigel Farage signs a copy of his party’s manifesto following its launch in Merthyr Tydfil (PA Wire)It also proposed a “patriotic curriculum”, which would include pairing the teaching of Britain’s history of slavery or European imperialism, with a non-European occurrence to “ensure balance”.Reform promised to make St George’s Day and St David’s Day public holidays, pledged a Free Speech Bill to “stop left-wing bias and politically correct ideology” and said it would scrap the TV licence, which funds the BBC. It also vowed to fast-track North Sea oil and gas licences.Mr Farage added that Reform wants to “simplify” the UK’s tax system, which it says totals more than 21,000 pages, while Hong Kong’s is 500 pages.The party is also proposing to lift the minimum profit threshold to £100,000 and reduce the main corporation tax rate from 25 per cent to 15 per cent in three years, which it says would “free” 1.2 million businesses.Elsewhere, it promises to abolish business rates for small and medium businesses by introducing an “online delivery tax” of 4 per cent for large companies.Mr Farage’s party also pledges to cut fuel duty by 20p per litre, scrap VAT on energy bills, scrap stamp duty on sales below £750,000 and ditch income tax for those earning less than £20,000.The document also states that inheritance tax would be scrapped for 98 per cent of all estates.",Nigel Farage pledges to run for PM in 2029 as Reform manifesto slated by economists,7,9

58,"For the past 12 years, dementia has plagued Chris Saunders’s life. His father was diagnosed with the disease in 2012, his mother four years on, and in a streak of unbearably bad luck, his father-in-law just days later. “It was just horrendous,” he says of trying to juggle looking after his loved ones with work and raising his son. “I’ll never recover.”Saunders is one of the many caught in Britain’s social care abyss.Paul Burstow, the former care minister, once described social care as “a third rail issue – you touch it politically and you get fried”.  Looking at its recent handling – and avoidance – by politicians, it’s not difficult to see why.Under England’s current system, care home residents with savings and assets worth more than £23,250 pay for all their social care costs, without a limit.Back in 2017, Theresa May’s manifesto proposed raising that threshold to £100,000. But family homes would have been included in that threshold for those in home-based care for the first time, prompting a furore in which the plan was dubbed a “dementia tax” and subsequently watered down by May.Two years later, in his inaugural prime ministerial speech, Boris Johnson promised an “oven-ready” solution to social care, saying “we’re going to fix the crisis in social care once and for all”.The former prime minister Boris Johnson during a visit to Westport Care Home in September 2021, ahead of unveiling his plan to fix the 'crisis in social care' - GettyCovid intervened. Then a plan to cap lifetime care costs at £86,000, due to be implemented in 2023, was bumped to October 2025.Now, for families who had hoped that this election would finally deliver the type of reform they have been promised for the best part of a decade, the issue appears to be a giant elephant in the room. Perhaps a direct result of previous occasions on which party leaders have been damaged by the issue, it is, it seems, largely being ducked this time around.The Tory manifesto recommits to the party’s 2025 target for a cap on costs. But it mentions dementia just once in its three pages on social care, saying that a future Conservative government would publish a separate strategy to ensure it, along with other common conditions such as cancer and heart disease, “receive the best possible care”. Labour’s manifesto, meanwhile, announced that Sir Keir Starmer would “create a National Care Service| to deal with a “sector [that] needs deep reform: there are inconsistent standards, chronic staff shortages, and people are not always treated with the care, dignity and respect they deserve”. The lightness of detail prompted the King’s Fund, a social care charity, to state that the Labour manifesto “largely dodges the issue of social care reform”.Yet dementia, which one in three of us will develop in our lifetimes, is currently blowing a £42 billion hole in the economy each year. Mark MacDonald, associate director of advocacy at Alzheimer’s Society, describes it as “the greatest health and social care challenge of our time…. yet dementia isn’t a priority amongst decision-makers”.In the absence of an existing cap on fees spent by an individual on their care (the 2011 Dilnot Commission on funding and social care suggested an upper limit of £35,000), and with the average dementia patient living for eight to 10 years, and annual care home costs between £59,000 to £73,000, selling the family home is often the only option for families pushed to the brink.“It’s a ticking time bomb,” Saunders, 49, says. “If someone was committing to it, that probably would sway my vote to that particular party, but this General Election is fast approaching, and I’m not seeing any evidence of that being on anyone’s agenda.”Saunders’s story will be familiar to anyone who has dealt with the disease up close. Having already endured the condition with one parent, Saunders, who works in the emergency services, quickly recognised what was happening to his mother, Audrey, when she forgot his birthday and began repeating questions in 2015, two years after his father’s death.Chris Saunders and his wife Nicola, both of whom had parents affected with dementia - Christopher PledgerStill, it took a year from Audrey’s first appointment to getting diagnosed with Alzheimer’s – after which the family was told to go into the next room, where someone from a charity handed them a leaflet. “And then you’re sent on your way, and that’s it really. You’ve got this diagnosis; this massive life-changing diagnosis – where do you go now? What help do we get?”While a cancer patient will receive their diagnosis along with a plan for NHS-funded next steps, there is no such roadmap for those with dementia – even though 40 per cent more of us, meaning 1.4 million people in total will be living with the condition in the UK by 2040, with an average care cost of £100,000.With local authorities instead of central government responsible for care provisions (almost two thirds of their budget is spent on adult and acute children’s social care), Saunders was left to battle labyrinthine council phone lines trying to track down the support they might be entitled to, which amounted to carers visiting Audrey a few times a day at her home.And then came the issue of a care home. When Audrey had a stroke in 2018, a meeting of healthcare workers determined that she needed to move into a home – news he and his wife, Nicola, welcomed, “because we were just broken,” he reflects.But while he sought support from Dementia UK, and hoped there would be some relief from life as “sandwich carers” for both their parents and child, finding somewhere for her to stay – and paying for it – quickly became a nightmare of its own. The decision had been reached on a Wednesday, “and the [hospital] wanted her out by the Friday, and that was left to me. No one was going to help me look. It was like, you’ve got two days, or we’ll just put her somewhere.”Saunders found a bed at a “middle-of-the-road” home nearby, at a monthly cost of £5,600. He was told that the local council would cover costs for the first 12 weeks, after which Saunders would need to repay that debt, and all those going forward – amounting to £67,000 per year, double the median salary in England. There was no option but to sell his mother’s house in West Sussex, blitzing through 30 years of memories in order to try and complete the sale within the stipulated 12-week window. It sold for £380,000; when she died in February, the entire pot had been spent.While dementia overtook his parents’ lives, Saunders’s mother-in-law was diagnosed with cancer – with her options entirely different to those given to the rest of the family. “If you need residential care because you are incapacitated through cancer… the NHS will pay for your care. But with dementia, it’s such a lottery.”The Labour Party's manifesto announced that Sir Keir Starmer would 'create a National Care Service to deal with a ""sector [that] needs deep reform' - Geoff PughThe King’s Fund senior fellow Simon Bottery says that when it comes to social care any incoming party’s strategy must be twofold: “Put[ting] enough money into the system so that we can support the current system to provide a decent standard of care to the people that need it.” And, reforming it entirely, and upping the number of those who are able to receive help. “What we have to do is to stop them ending up paying catastrophic costs.”Kieran Osborne, managing director of Squiggle Consult, which provides advice on estate planning, says that “people are definitely worried about losing the family home and the potential impact on inheritance. It’s one of the biggest concerns I hear from families.” Due to “deliberate deprivation” legislation, giving away your home or setting up a trust to pre-empt or sidestep care costs are unlawful; he advises that setting up power of attorney is the most prudent step, which usually takes around five months to register.Meanwhile, there appears to be an opportunity for any party that shows a genuine willingness to finally grasp the nettle of social care.

85,"I’m not sure what I’m covering anymore. Is this an election, or an episode of The Prisoner?The scene: a Starmer-meets-real-people event at the Gabardine Bar in Basingstoke. It’s not a town Labour should be winning (majority 14,000). The Gabardine is not socialist territory (the window says “CHEESE & CHARCUTERIE”). Nor are there many real people about: just the bar staff, a couple of punters who came for a coffee and got trapped, and the press – hippos hungry for a story – who watch the window for signs of arrival.The leader appears on the high street. “He’s got Theo Paphitis with him!” An old lady stops the pair – you can’t plan for everything – and they chat briefly. I think I lip-read the words “...love you in Dragon’s Den”. Finally, they enter the charcuterie, Keir dressed head-to-toe in black, Theo in a shirt undone practically to the navel. Turn on a glitter ball and it’s a disco.Keir eats nothing, he drinks nothing. The owner complains about business being down, but from what I can see, Labour won’t help. “Country first,” says our next PM. “Clear plan for the future!” Then he addresses a semi-circle of TV cameras, shuffling from one t’other – BBC, ITV, twist, turn, evade – dodging bullets. The Telegraph asks if he agrees with Tony Blair that women have a vagina. He does, as do I – though if Tony says it, I find myself doubting it’s true.What the heck is happening? This is the apotheosis of Keir Starmer, he stands on the brink of the biggest majority in a century – and yet the public is going to vote for him having hardly met him, his campaign so tightly controlled a philosopher might say it never happened. In that black suit, he really does look like Patrick McGoohan in The Prisoner, running for election in a village populated by actors.I go rogue: let’s ask Theo a question. “Mr Paphitis,” I say, “would you invest in this man?”“Absolutely!” he laughs. Otherwise, “I wouldn’t be here”. But behind the laugh, I realise I’ve accidentally touched a nerve. Pressed on how much actual money he’s given to Labour, he replies “it might be zilch at the moment” – but he’s here with Keir and “action speaks louder than words”.Sir Keir and Mr Paphitis also visited a jewellery college in Basingstoke - Stefan Rousseau/PADoesn’t money speak louder still? “Well, does it?” he replies. “Lots of people just give money, I’ve given my time.” Hmm – that’s what I tell myself when I go to church and leave nothing on the donation plate.Was he ever a Conservative? Yes. Did he like Maggie? Indeed. So why not vote Tory? They’ve become self-obsessed and forgotten how to run the economy. Then a surprise, to him and to me: the other day “I found myself agreeing with Nigel Farage and I had to sit down and take a chill pill”. What about?! “He said Brexit didn’t fail, it is the government, the politicians who failed.” Around this point, Theo was gently led away by a staffer who felt he might enjoy talking to someone else, anyone else, perhaps the wall.As they say in showbiz: “Never work with children, animals or celebrities.”","Theo Paphitis goes off-message as he invests time, but not cash, in Starmer",8,11

Surely that says an awful lot about where we are.“There’s a litany of failures in relation to knife crime and it’s frustrating for me that it’s not part of the debate and the focus is not on the safety of children.“Knife crime hasn’t been dominant in terms of the election debate so far. Sadly I think knife crime only tends to hit the news when something tragic happens.“This is a really big issue that is not getting the attention it deserves during the election campaign.”Two 12-year-old boys have been found guilty of murdering Shawn Seesahai (West Midlands Police)Rachel Duncan’s nephew James Bascoe-Smith was left with life-changing brain injuries after he miraculously survived an unprovoked knife attack in Brixton in 2021.James, now 20, has had to learn to eat and speak again and requires full time care after two masked men, who were jailed in 2022, stabbed him in the chest and left him for dead.She urgently called all parties to prioritise building a “joined up” public health approach to saving lives and better support for survivors.“Young people are losing their lives on the streets.

With crime it is almost as if we have become immune to it and we have run out of ideas.”He said the recent case involving two 12-year-old killers “beggars belief”.Figures show offences involving a knife or sharp instrument increased by seven per cent last year – with 49,489 recorded by police between January and December 2023.This was up from 46,153 in 2022, but three per cent lower than pre-Covid pandemic levels.Rishi Sunak has promised to recruit 8,000 extra police officers.In Labour’s manifesto, published on Thursday, Sir Keir Starmer vowed to halve knife crime in a decade.

267,"Sir Keir Starmer has said he will not increase the tax burden on 'working people' - Stefan Rousseau/PASir Keir Starmer has opened the door to tax rises for millions of Britons by defining a working person as someone who relies on public services and does not have savings.The Labour leader has repeatedly ruled out putting up taxes on “working people”, who he says have borne the brunt of the cost of living crisis.Asked what he meant by the term, he said it referred to “people who earn their living, rely on our services and don’t really have the ability to write a cheque when they get into trouble”.The definition means millions of Britons, including pensioners, savers and those who use private services such as healthcare, may not be covered by his tax rise pledge.Senior Tories claimed the remarks showed that Sir Keir was preparing to “wallop” savers and homeowners with tax rises, warning them to “be very afraid”.Labour has promised not to raise rates of income tax, national insurance or VAT for at least five years if it wins power, but has refused to rule out other tax rises.Sir Keir would not rule out an increase in council tax on Tuesday, saying that he could not “sit here two weeks before the election and write the budgets for the next five years”.But he said he had been “really clear we’re not going to be raising tax on working people” and that “none of our plans require tax rises over and above the ones we’ve set out”.Asked what he meant by working people, he sai: “The person I have in my mind when I say working people is people who earn their living, rely on our services and don’t really have the ability to write a cheque when they get into trouble.“So the sort of people I’m meeting pretty well every day now. It’s quite a big group, because these days there are many people obviously not so well-off.”He gave the example of a woman he had met in Southampton who has “got one job, she’s trying to get another job, and the bills are still bearing down on her”.Sir Iain Duncan Smith, a former Tory leader, said: “How unbelievable to say those who generate wealth, who work hard, who are successful, who add huge value to the British economy, to dismiss them completely.“They are his targets for higher taxation. If you have savings, if you own a home, if you own wealth, you are going to get walloped. That is a big admission. His levelling up isn’t levelling up, it’s levelling down. The old socialist in there who supported Jeremy Corbyn is still alive and well.”Sir Iain Duncan Smith said Sir Keir Starmer had made 'a big admission' - Carl Court/GettyThere are 11 million working-age people in Britain who have less than £1,000 in savings according to a recent Resolution Foundation report. That is typically considered to be the minimum “rainy day” contingency fund needed to cover unexpected costs that may crop up in life.But that still means two in three working households do have what could be considered sufficient savings to not qualify as “working people” under Sir Keir’s definition.On top of that, one in eight Britons now relies on private health insurance, according to a survey carried out by pollsters YouGov last year.The parents of 615,000 children who are privately educated are already facing having to fork out thousands more when VAT is applied to private school fees, while 12.5 million retirees, on the current trajectory, face being taxed on the state pension for the first time from 2027.Sir Keir’s comments also imply that people who own substantial assets, such as the 2.8 million landlords in the UK, would also not be considered working people.",Starmer suggests savers aren’t ‘working people’,8,11
194,"Rishi Sunak has fired the starting gun on a July general election, setting in motion a few frenzied weeks of campaigning before people go to the polls for the first national vote since 2019.The last stage before that final verdict will be the exit poll, which offers a unique window on the outcome – and the 10pm ballot does have an impressive track record.Prof Sir John Curtice, who leads the team that crunches the numbers broadcast to the nation as the polls close, says that its recent history makes the forecast worthy of close attention.“The record isn’t perfect, but since 2005 the exit poll has given a pretty good indication of where the result will end up on the night. It also tends to be more accurate than opinion polls carried out before voting happens,” he says.Poll tracker: Conservatives falling as general election loomsFollow The Telegraph’s general election live coverageThe exit poll is based on a small sample of voters from around 130 polling stations spread throughout the country.People at each station are approached at random by fieldworkers, who hand them a replica ballot. The voter then privately fills in the ballot to indicate how they voted and puts it into a box.“We use these replica ballots to make models that predict how constituencies will have voted,” Prof Curtice says.“The data we get from those ballots is compared against how people voted at the same polling station at the previous general election.“Crucially this shows the geography of how people’s votes have changed. From this, we make a series of equations that indicate who is likely to win each constituency. When you add up all these equations you arrive at your final forecast for the whole country,” he explains.The forecasts made for each constituency are also influenced by what is known about people who live there, for example how they voted in the 2016 EU referendum.A constituency’s physical location also informs the predictions made about it.“For example if a box of ballots comes from a northern seat, and there seems to be a rise in people voting Labour across the north, then the models are adjusted for that too,” Prof Curtice says.This all means that it can be harder to predict the result of a general election in more contentious years. The 2015 exit poll failed to predict a Conservative majority and instead suggested a hung parliament. But in other years the exit poll has predicted the winning party’s majority down to the exact number of seats.The 2023 boundary review means that the shape and size of a number of constituencies will change at the next general election. Prof Curtice is confident that this won’t throw the exit poll too far off the truth.“Where there are boundary changes we will be basing our equations on how a given constituency voted at the last election, rather than the polling station itself,” he explains.“This might slightly increase the chance that we’re wrong in our forecast for a particular constituency, but given all of the information we have about voters, I don’t think that this leaves a chance for errors on a systematic level.”",How accurate are exit polls?

15,"A dossier drawn up by Labour MPs proposed six new tax rises to raise £60 billion.The proposals from the party’s Tribune group – of which Sir Keir Starmer is a member – set out increases to inheritance tax, capital gains taxes and a new “jackpot” levy on the super-rich.Under the plan, working pensioners would also be forced to pay national insurance (NI), council tax would be reformed which could double bills and the cap on NI would be removed.The document, seen by the Daily Mail, was submitted as part of discussions about what would go in Labour’s manifesto by the Tribune group of MPs, whose members also include David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, and Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary.Laura Trott, the Conservative Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said the proposals were “shocking”.“After spending the whole campaign failing to rule out these tax rises, it’s clear from this document that their plan all along has been to raise taxes across the board,” she said.“It’s now time for the Labour Party to come clean with the public: which taxes are they planning to raise?”But a Labour spokesman dismissed the claims, telling the Daily Mail that Sir Keir had “nothing to do with” the manifesto submission and that it was rejected at an early stage of manifesto deliberations.“None of this is Labour policy,” the spokesman said. “The Tories are the party of high taxes. Labour will ensure taxes on working people are as low as possible.”The Tribune manifesto submission said the six tax rises are “consistent” with Labour’s values but “do not represent specific policy positions”.The dossier proposes extending NI to all sources of income to raise a claimed £12 billion. Pension payments would be exempt but working pensioners’ salaries would not be.The cap on NI would also be removed. Currently, NI is paid at a rate of eight per cent on all earnings up to £50,268 and two per cent on income above that threshold. That rate would instead be increased to eight per cent, raising £20 billion.Capital gains tax would also be equalised with income tax rates to bring in £16 billion, while inheritance tax reliefs on farmland, business property and pension pots would be axed to raise £4 billion.Council tax rates would be reformed to become “fairer”, meaning rates in more expensive areas could double.Lastly, a “jackpot tax” on what the proposal deems “extreme wealth” would raise £10 billion a year.Labour’s manifesto contains proposals for tax rises worth a total of £8.6 billion.The party has insisted it will not raise income tax, National Insurance or VAT.But senior figures have refused to rule out raising capital gains tax or council tax, saying only that there are “no plans” to do so.",Starmer-backed group of Labour MPs proposed six tax rises worth £60bn,9,11

245,"Since May 2023, voters across the UK have been asked to show a form of photographic ID at their local ballot box.The requirement draws on the recommendations of a 2016 report by Lord Pickles, the former communities secretary, which warned there was a risk of “significant abuse” in the electoral system if people could vote under false pretences with little risk of detection.As Labour continues to hold a lead of around 20 percentage points in the latest election opinion polls, The Telegraph sets out everything you need to know about voting rules ahead of the general election on July 4.Here are the acceptable forms of identification you can bring to vote for an election candidate. Follow The Telegraph’s general election live coverageWhat are the voter ID requirements?Everyone wanting to vote in the UK must produce photo ID to take part in certain elections.For voters in England, Scotland and Wales, this includes UK parliamentary elections, by-elections and recall petitions. Those in England also need their ID for local elections.The requirement does not apply to Holyrood, Senedd or council elections in Scotland and Wales. People in Northern Ireland already needed photo ID to vote, so the rule change does not affect them.Voters in both England and Wales also need ID for police and crime commissioner elections.The rule has been applied in stages, beginning with the local elections in England on May 4, 2023. This year’s general election will be the first time ID is required for a national poll.The change marks a significant departure from the previous system in most of the UK, where voters only had to verbally confirm their name and address.What types of ID are accepted?Voters are required to show one form of photo ID at the polls, and it does not need to be in date so long as it is recognisable as the person at the ballot box.However, it must be the original version – not a photocopy – and the name on the ID should be the same as it appears on the electoral register.Acceptable forms of voter ID include:Passport issued by the UK, any of the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, a British Overseas Territory, an EEA state or a Commonwealth country (including an Irish Passport Card)Full or provisional driving licence issued by the UK, any of the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, or an EEA stateA Blue BadgeAny identity card bearing the Pass (Proof of Age Standards Scheme) hologramAny of the following travel passes:Older person’s bus pass funded by the GovernmentDisabled person’s bus pass funded by the GovernmentOyster 60+ card funded by the GovernmentFreedom passScottish national entitlement card issued for the purpose of concessionary travel (including a 60+, disabled or under 22s bus pass)60 and over Welsh concessionary travel cardDisabled person’s Welsh concessionary travel cardSenior SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandRegistered blind SmartPass or blind person’s SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandWar disablement SmartPass issued in Northern Ireland60+ SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandHalf fare SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandAny of these government-issued documents:Biometric immigration documentMinistry of Defence Form 90 (Defence Identity Card)National identity card issued by an EEA stateElectoral identity card issued in Northern IrelandVoter authority certificateAnonymous elector’s documentDo the rules apply to postal votes?No. You do not need to have any form of photo ID to vote by post.However, you will be asked to provide your National Insurance (NI) number when you apply to verify your identity. If you are not able to do this, you will need to explain why.The deadline to apply for a postal vote is 5pm on Wednesday June 19 in England, Scotland and Wales, with Saturday June 15 the limit in Northern Ireland. You must also already be registered to vote.How can I get a voter ID card?You can apply for a free voter authority certificate (VAC) either online or by post. To complete an online application, you will need a recent, digital photo of yourself and your NI number.You can still apply if you don’t have an NI number but you will need to provide alternative documents as proof of identity, such as your birth certificate, a bank statement or utility bill.To apply by post, you will need to fill out and send a form to your local electoral registration office.You will need the address of where you are registered to vote, a recent photo of yourself and your NI number.Again, other supporting documents are accepted but using these may prolong the application process.The electoral registration office must receive your form by 5pm, six working days before the election you wish to vote in.There is a different form to complete if you want to apply by post and you are living abroad, a member of the Armed Forces, a civil servant or a British Council employee.What if I do not have a valid ID?Anyone without a form of ID that fits the requirements can apply for a VAC.This is not a substitute to registering for vote, which must be done in advance of any application.Why was voter ID introduced?The aim was to stamp out voter fraud by forcing people to prove their identity at the polls.In his Government-commissioned report, Lord Pickles warned that the authorities were in a “state of denial” and “turning a blind eye” to the problem of electoral fraud.Why is voter ID so controversial?The Government has said the change is necessary to curb the “inexcusable potential” for “stealing someone’s vote” by simply quoting their name and address at the ballot box.However, critics say actual claims of electoral fraud are very rare in the UK.In 2019, the last general election year, there were only 33 allegations of impersonation at the polling station out of more than 58 million votes cast, according to the Electoral Reform Society.Opponents of the rule have also warned it will make it more difficult for certain people to vote, including the disabled, transgender and non-binary people, and black and ethnic minority groups.",The photo ID you need to vote in UK elections,9,11
81,"It won’t be long before the UK goes to the polls to decide who their next prime minister should be.In the build-up to July 4, we have seen vigorous campaigning from all parties as they vie for votes up and down the country.All the large parties have now released their election manifestos, laying out their vision for the future of Britain.Labour wants to add 20% VAT to private school fees, to pay for 6,500 extra teachers in England’s state schools. The party also aims to build 1.5 million new homes in the next five years and says it will restore plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030.Meanwhile, part of Rishi Sunak’s plan to get people onto the property ladder is a resurrection of the Help to Buy scheme, which would provide first-time buyers with an equity loan of up to 20% towards the cost of one of these new homes.The Conservative Party’s manifesto also pledges to abolish National Insurance for the self-employed, implement tougher sentences for offences including knife crime, grooming and assaults against retail workers, and underlines the plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda, saying there will be a “regular rhythm of flights every month.”Two of Reform UK’s core five pledges also involve migration. The party says it would freeze non-essential immigration, but concedes there would be exceptions with work in healthcare considered essential.The Liberal Democrats plan to introduce free personal care in England, similar to the system that operates in Scotland where people needing help with daily tasks do not have to pay.While each party passionately puts forth its case to the electorate, it is ultimately down to voters to decide what – and who – they think will take the country forward.We want to know the issues that matter the most to you in this general election campaign.

The prime minister is taking calls from the audience and Nick Ferrari about the NHS, tax and the future of young poeple.During the show, he has hit back at billionaires John Caudwell and Sir Jim Ratcliffe after they announced they were backing Labour. The PM has also promised to serve as an MP for five years if the Tories lose the election.Mr Sunak hailed “good news” after official figures confirmed a drop in the rate of inflation. According to the Office for National Statistics, the rate of Consumer Prives Index fell to 2 per cent in May, down from 2.3 per cent in April.It comes as a new poll found more than half of the UK public thinks Reform UK leader Nigel Farage would make a bad or terrible prime minister.A YouGov survey found 55 per cent of Britons thought Mr Farage would make a bad (12 per cent) or terrible prime minister (43 per cent) a day after he unveiled his party’s manifesto.Key PointsInflation falls 2% returning to Bank of England targetRishi Sunak vows to serve five years as a backbench MPSunak: Labour’s new donors can afford Sir Keir’s tax risesPrime minister accused of ‘lying through his teeth’Reeves welcomes inflation drop but ‘cost of living still acute for families’Boris Johnson pulls out from Tory campaign to go on holidayRwanda plan is the ‘choice at this election’, Rishi Sunak claims09:00 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak has said the number of small boat crossings have fallen in the past year, but the number who have arrived so far this year is at a record level, Archie Mitchell reports.He stressed that there is a stark choice for voters at the general election between the Labour Party who will not send migrants to Rwanda, and the Conservatives who will.So far, the Conservatives have spent almost £300m of taxpayer cash without sending a single asylum seeker to the east African nation as part of the scheme.Sunak criticised for being ‘richer than the King’08:59 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak is grilled by an LBC caller for being “richer than the King” and being unable to relate to struggling poeple.A caller asks: “How as a prime minister that is richer than our king relate to any of our struggles?”The prime minister replies that he will “always have people’s backs in tough times”. But the caller accuses him of lying about supporting poeple through the pandemic.Nick Ferrari then asks the PM: “Do you accept you are rich?”Rishi Sunak replied yes he is rich, adding that he has been “very fortunate in my life”.“I’m not going to apologise for that because my parents worked really hard,” he added.The prime minister denied wearing a £500 coat to an election visit in Brighton and said “not a single person has spoken to me about what I am wearing” on the campaign trail.LBC plays clip from Figen Murray08:53 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak has been confronted by Figen Murray, the mother of Manchester Arena bombing victim Martyn Hett, over why he has not passed a law in her son’s honour yet, Archie Mitvhell reports.The prime minister was asked why it is referred to as a “priority” in the Conservative Party manifesto despite him promising Ms Murray 18 months ago that he would pass it.She said: “You have put in your manifesto that Martyn’s law is a priority. I don’t know what you mean by that because you promised me 18 months ago, in a phone call on what would have been Martyn’s 35th birthday, that you’re going to really Hurry up with Martyn’s law and you’re very committed to it. And there has been nothing since then.”The PM said he is still planning to pass the law before summer recess if he is re-elected, despite only having a week of time scheduled between the reopening of parliament after the election and MPs going on their holidays.Mother of Manchester Arena victim finished 200 Mile campaign walk to Downing Street (Getty Images)Prime minister denies being anti-LGBT rights08:46 , Salma OuaguiraThe prime minister has been forced to deny he is against LGBT rights after a gay man confronted him on LBC, Archie Mitchell reports.The caller said: “You did not vote for gay marriage to be extended to Northern Ireland, you never wear a red ribbon on world AIDS day and you have behaved disgracefully when it comes to the trans community and when Brianna Ghey’s mother came to parliament.“And you are obsessed with divisive culture war issues.”Mr Sunak said he was “sorry to hear that you feel that way” and said he wants people to be respected and treated with compassion “whatever their backgrounds”.He also said he never wears ribbons to mark social causes other than poppies because he does not want to give the impression of prioritising some while ignoring others.Will Rishi Sunak restore trust in the resignation honours process?08:42 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak has been asked whether he will pack the House of Lords with allies in his resignation honours list or help to “restore trust in our institutions”, Archie Mitchell reports.The prime minister said he would not speculate on future appointments but that he has always followed the recommendations of the House of Lords Appointment Commission (HOLAC).Rishi Sunak having a tough time on LBC08:39 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak’s LBC phone-in got off to a cracking start, with the prime minister able to talk up the benefits of inflation returning to the Bank of England’s 2 per cent target, Archie Mitchell reports.But it was quickly downhill from then, with Mr Sunak coming under fire over the state of the NHS, Tory donor Frank Hester (who said Diane Abbott “should be shot”), soaring tuition fees and the lack of affordable housing for young people.He has insisted he is fighting for every vote in the general election and that he believes the Conservatives can win.But the audience is notably more hostile for Mr Sunak today than it was for Sir Keir Starmer, who took an hour of calls from LBC listeners on Tuesday.The Labour leader came unstuck over his past support for Jeremy Corbyn and potential tax rises if he wins the election, but otherwise was less criticised than the PM has been today.One caller went as far as accusing Mr Sunak of “lying through his teeth”.The show has taken a break for the news, but the PM has just under half an hour to go. (LBC)‘Why has the NHS gone from five stars to one stars?'08:37 , Salma OuaguiraA caller who has breast cancer has asked Rishi Sunak about the state of the NHS. She says the treatment has been horrible and what is happening with the health service is “frightening”.Mr Sunak says he is “sorry” to hear about what she had to go through. The prime minister said the pandemic made a differenxe to treatment quality and outlines the breast cancer measures he plans to implement.He adds: “Community diagnostic centres are opening...and the government is hiring more oncologists.”Rishi Sunak accused of ‘lying through his teeth’08:28 , Salma OuaguiraAn LBC caller has accused Rishi Sunak of “lying through his teeth” after the PM defended the Tories’ record on housing after 14 years.In a tough phone-in, Mr Sunak was told: “You’ve had a decade and a half to improve housing, to improve rental conditions, to improve any of the issues I talked about and I think that young people just don’t believe your promises anymore.”Mr Sunak said he had abolished tenant deposit fees and that the quality of rental accommodation has risen under the Tories.Sunak compares Diane Abbott comments to Tory donor Frank Hester’s racist remarks08:25 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak has repeated that the Tories’ biggest donor Frank Hester was “wrong” to say that Labour veteran Diane Abbott “makes you want to hate all black people” and “should be shot”, Archie Mitchell reports.But he said that “if people who are genuinely contrite have apologised and understand what they’ve done, that should be accepted”.The prime minister compared Mr Hester’s comments to comments made by Ms Abbott which she was suspended from the Labour Party for.She has since been readmitted, and the PM told LBC: “Diane Abbott has been readmitted into the Labour Party, and she herself had made some comments in the past, that weren’t appropriate, but she apologised for those and was readmitted back into the Labour Party after having the whip withdrawn.”Sunak challenged over life chances for young people08:21 , Salma OuaguiraA young caller has challenged the prime minister over the life chances of young people after 14 years of Conservative government, Archie Mitchell reports.The LBC listener said housing is now unaffordable, tuition fees have risen, the NHS is crumbling and that the Tories have done little to tackle climate change. “How could you possibly argue that life is better for young people after consecutive Tory prime ministers?” the caller asked.Mr Sunak did not address the party’s record, promising instead to make it easier for young people to buy houses if he is re-elected. (LBC)Rishi Sunak vows to serve five years as a backbench MP08:15 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak has promised to serve his five year term as a backbench MP for Richmond and Northallerton if he loses the general election but holds his seat, Archie Mithell reports.The prime minister had been expected to swan off to California rather than spend five years travelling between the North Yorkshire seat and London.He told LBC he was focused on winning the general election but he “hopes very much” to represent them for another parliament.Labour’s new donors can afford Sir Keir’s tax rises, Rishi Sunak says08:14 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak has brushed off the defection of major Tory donor John Caudwell to Labour, saying he can “probably afford the party’s tax rises”, Archie Mitchell reports.The prime minister said as “Britain’s richest men”, Mr Caudwell and Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who is also backing Labour, they will be fine under Sir Keir Starmer’s rule.“But for tens of millions of people who are working really hard, they can’t and I want to cut people’s taxes,” Mr Sunak told LBC.Rishi Sunak: ‘I am really energised talking to the country’08:11 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak has ignored a question about how well he thinks the campaign is going, instead telling an LBC caller he is “energised” talking to the country and launching into his stump campaign speech, Archie Mitchell reports.The prime minister said Labour would put people’s taxes up while the Conservatives would cut them.Asked about the huge gap between Labour and the Conservatives in the polls, Mr Sunak said there is only one poll that matters, the general election on 4 July. (LBC)Rishi Sunak to face LBC radio call-in08:07 , Salma OuaguiraThe prime minister is set to face voters in another LBC radio call-in after Sir Keir Starmer was grilled live on Tuesday.Mr Sunak will appear on Nick Ferrari’s radio show to answer questions from listeners all over the country this morning.It comes as the Labour leader continued to insist Labour has no plans to raise taxes outside those it has already specified during the programme yesterday.“None of our plans require tax rises over and above the ones we have set out,” he said.Pressed on whether this would include a council tax band revaluation, he said: “What I am not going to do is sit here two-and-a-bit weeks before the election and write the budgets for the next five years.“What I can say is that none of our plans require a tax rise, and that is for a reason, and the reason is our focus in getting our economy going, on building, on growing, on raising living standards, on creating wealth.”Rishi Sunak celebrates ‘inflation back to normal'08:02 , Salma OuaguiraGood news this morning👇 pic.twitter.com/8mNVIQBGAz— Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak) June 19, 2024Reeves says inflation drop welcome but 'cost of living still acute for families’07:43 , Salma OuaguiraThe shadow chancellor has reacted to the announcement that inflation has dropped 2 per cent returning to the Bank of England’s target.Reacting to the announcement, she said the drop is welcomed but there’s nothing to celebrate.She told Sky News: “We welcome the fact that inflation has come back to the target, but unlike the Conservative ministers I am not going to claim that everything is fine.Ms Reeves added that the cost of living crisis is “still acute for many families” and warned voters about “five more years of the same with the Conservatives”.She said: “While the numbers on inflation are welcomed, I am not going to start claiming that somehow things are all ok today because I know that for many people they are not.”Rachel Reeves speaking on Sky News (Sky News)Labour frontbencher fails to rule out fiscal event before summer07:35 , Salma OuaguiraLabour frontbencher Anneliese Dodds has refused to rule out that the party could hold a summer Budget if they win the general election.Asked the question during an interview on Sky News, Ms Dodds said: “Well, I’m going to have to say something before I answer that question, which is that barely any votes have been cast. Postal votes are only just starting to land now. So, you know, still lots of people who don’t know. We’re getting up and down the country to have that conversation with them.“If we are given that chance to serve, the very first thing that we will do for our economy is that first economic step that Keir and Rachel set out before the general election was even called.” (REUTERS)Johnson set to go on holiday rather than campaign for Tories07:15 , Alexander ButlerBoris Johnson is set to go on holiday rather than join the Conservative campaign trail ahead of the general election, according to Tory sources.The former prime minister, who turned 60 on Wednesday, is expected to go on his second summer holiday this year within the next few days and return on 3 July,The Times reported.Despite endorsing 50 Tory candidates across the country, Johnson is no longer expected to join the Tories on the doorstep due to the party facing decimation in red wall seats he won in 2019.Breaking: Inflation falls 2% returning to Bank of England target07:13 , Salma OuaguiraUK Inflation dropped to 2% in May, which is down from 2.3% in April, returning to the official target set by the Bank of England.It marks the first time inflation has been at the Bank of England’s target since July 2021, before the cost-of-living crisis saw inflation shoot up – at one stage hitting levels not seen for 40 years.The good news are likely to give a pre-election boost to the Conservatives, with Rishi Sunak already declaring victory on inflation last month – even though inflation was always expected to fall sharply as rising energy and food costs subside.But experts said it is unlikely to boost chances of an early summer interest rate cut.Most economists believe the Bank of England will hold rates at 5.25% on Thursday, with the election denting hopes of a reduction before the nation head to the polls on July 4.Investec economist Sandra Horsfield said: “Welcome though a return to target inflation would be, the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) is unlikely to be fully satisfied should the numbers meet our expectations. In the (Bank’s) May Monetary Policy Report, the baseline forecast was for a 1.9% inflation rate. Nor it is clear that inflation will stay at 2% from now on – In fact, we expect a small rise again over the second half of the year.”General Election Campaign: 15 days to go07:08 , Salma OuaguiraWith just over two weeks to go to the polls, parties are entering the last sprint of the campaign trail.Here’s what can we expect from today:Rishi Sunak will be answering calls from voters in an hour-long LBC morning phone-in.The SNP will unveil its manifesto in Edinburgh where John Swinney will appear alongside Patina activists.Sir Keir Starmer and shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves will visit a supermarket in Wiltshire.Daisy Cooper to unveil a new poster van in Jeremy Hunt’s Godalming and Ash constituency.Rochdale MP George Galloway is expected to launch his manifesto in Manchester.Cabinet wives Akshata Murty, Lucia Hunt and Susie Cleverly are campaigning with Lucy Frazer in Cambridgeshire.We’ll also learn the final number of people who have registered to vote.The Office for National Statistic will publish inflation figures.From Dawn Butler’s rap to Suella’s viral clip, this ‘TikTok election’ isn’t working07:00 , Alexander ButlerFrom Dawn Butler’s rap to Suella’s viral clip, this ‘TikTok election’ isn’t workingInside election social media campaign costs as Labour outspends all other parties combined05:00 , Alexander ButlerLabour has spent over £2.4 million on social media ads since the general election campaign began, more than twice as much as the Tories.Analysis by campaign spending non-profit Who Targets Me has found political parties spent more than £3.49 million on social media advertising since Rishi Sunak called the election on 22 May.Around 70 per cent of that has been commissioned by Labour Party groups and candidates, including Sir Keir Starmer, Welsh Labour, and Rachel Reeves.Inside election social media campaign costs as Labour outspends all parties combinedLabour wants a new Brexit deal – here’s why business shouldn’t get its hopes up04:00 , Alexander ButlerLabour wants a new Brexit deal – here’s why business shouldn’t get its hopes upIndependent readers say addressing Brexit should be a priority for the next government02:00 , Alexander ButlerReaders say addressing Brexit should be a priority for the next governmentGeneral Election 2024: How do I vote on July 4 and when is the deadline to register?01:00 , Alexander ButlerThe UK will take to the polls on July 4 after prime minister Rishi Sunak called a snap general election at the end of May.Speaking outside of Downing Street, the prime minister announced that King Charles had granted his request to dissolve Parliament and promised to “fight for every vote” in the run up to polling day.The following weeks have seen fervent campaigning from all parties, as they vie for votes up and down the country.

244,"Should we be worried about election interference? mathisworks via Getty ImagesShortly after Rishi Sunak announced the general election, a committee of parliamentarians warned him that hostile states could reach the “British public far more easily than ever before”.Fears of interference in democratic processes are nothing new, but the National Security Committee said the UK is a particularly “attractive target” to malicious actors looking to disrupt the country this summer.As election day creeps closer, what threats could we realistically face, where are they coming from and are we doing enough to stop them?What triggered these national security concerns?The National Security Committee told Sunak in May that hostile actors could be tempted to interfere with the UK.It formally attributed malicious activity targeting UK institutions and individuals to hackers working for Russian intelligence services and China.Moscow is a particular cause for concern, considering the UK government said in 2020 that it was “almost certain that Russian actors sought to interfere in the 2019 general elections”.According to the committee, we can “expect to see the integrity of our systems tested again” now, five years later.The MPs and peers suggested cyber-attacks, ransomware targeted against UK institutions, AI-generated disinformation and targeted phishing attacks were all possible ahead of the election.And it was not long until some of their predictions appeared to come true.In early June, London hospitals were hit by a cyber-attack expected to take “many months” to resolve. More than 800 planned operations and 700 outpatient appointments had to be rearranged.The former head of National Cyber Security Centre quickly blamed a Russian cyber group.Meanwhile, AI tools have been used to produce fake audio recordings of politicians such as Labour leader Keir Starmer and London mayor Sadiq Khan.Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting was also mimicked in a “deepfake” – a digitally-doctored video – which was shared widely online.Here’s an example of how easy it is to produce fake content now:🇬🇧 We found that AI voice tools can be easily manipulated to generate disinfo ahead of the UK elections, including false clips of Rishi Sunak & Keir Starmer.AI-generated election disinfo can mislead voters & harm democracy. Listen to Starmer's voice clone 🎧 pic.twitter.com/0VzwNU7Tld— Center for Countering Digital Hate (@CCDHate) June 17, 2024Why would Russia want to interfere with British politics?Senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, Keir Giles, told HuffPost UK: “There shouldn’t be any doubt that Russia is interested in interfering in our elections.”Similarly, Pia Huesch, a research analyst at the British defence and security think tank Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) said Britain’s vocal support of Ukraine means the elections are “naturally at the receiving end of Russian information operations”.Both experts agreed Moscow is not looking for a particular outcome – it only wants to cause disruption.As Giles noted, the Conservatives and Labour, “are basically indistinguishable”  in their opposition to Russia and support for Ukraine amid the ongoing war.“Russia wants to undermine faith in government institutions, faith in democracy, faith and democratic processes,” he said. “By policing the suggestion that they might have influenced the results of one of those processes, the effect is a win as far as Moscow is concerned.”Giles pointed out there is little solid proof of Russian interference in UK politics.The government’s 2020 Russia report said “credible open-source commentary” suggested Moscow ran “influence campaigns” related to the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.But, despite speculation about the 2016 EU referendum and 2019 general election, it’s unclear if either event was subject to Moscow meddling.And that’s still the situation years later.Giles said: “There are a lot of unknowns about the extent to which Russia is operating at the moment, because finding that out takes a big investment in resources and manpower and government attention, which it does not always get.”What form of interference is likely to come in?Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, Centre for Counting Digital Hate (CCDH) told HuffPost UK that “online misinformation about elections” has always been a threat to democracies.Introducing sophisticated yet unsafe AI technology is just going to pour petrol on the fire.”Imran Ahmed, CCDHBut he noted it is even tougher now because leading generative AI platforms have “insufficient guardrails to stop bad actors using them to produce political misinformation”.Ahmed said: “Social media companies have never got to grips with the problem.“Introducing sophisticated yet unsafe AI technology is just going to pour petrol on the fire.”CCDH warned that AI platforms have become highly sophisticated already, and quality is constantly improving, making it harder for the ordinary user to differentiate between what’s real and what is not.In fact, Reuters’ 2024 Digital News Report found 59% of people are concerned about identifying what is real and what is fake when consuming online news.That’s an increase of three percentage points in the last year.Ahmed warned that over time, the “risk that elections will be adversely impacted” will only become more severe.He said: “AI image and audio generators are readily available to anyone, making them a potential tool for foreign governments interested in disrupting democracy. “Just last month, OpenAI reported intercepting Russian groups using AI to advance their agendas.”Huesch told HuffPost UK that while bots and AI are causing more disruption, she believes it does not have to be that sophisticated to “further feed into people’s fears and beliefs”.“For many, these campaigns reaffirm and perhaps amplify existing beliefs but it does not take a sophisticated AI-generated deep fake to do so,” the researcher explained.As the Alan Turing Institute explains in this clip, there are many subtle ways voters can be confused by AI ahead of the election.❓ How can we stop AI-enabled threats damaging our democracy?📖 Find out how the Turing is analysing threats from around the world to help the UK strengthen protections for elections: https://t.co/6SW0sQIgnmpic.twitter.com/mu9kEinAuE— The Alan Turing Institute (@turinginst) June 1, 2024What about Russia’s wider information warfare? Russia’s disruption is not just limited to large events like elections.Giles warned: “Russian information warfare is a constant.“They can lay the groundwork for years and decades for influencing specific events that are later dates in one direction or another.”He referred to Jeremy Corbyn’s use of classified documents as evidence that the Tories were planning to sell off the NHS ahead of the 2019 general election.The government claimed this paperwork had been distributed by “Russian actors” online.The ex-Labour leader vehemently denied Labour may have benefited from a Russian operation, and Moscow denied any involvement. The source of the dossier remains unclear today.Further confusion followed when the Conservatives were accused of delaying the publication of a government report into Russia’s interference.When it was eventually published in July 2020, it spotted that some members of the Russian elite had connections to British politics, and liked to keep their money in the UK.As Giles said: “It’s a mistake to think that this is all just about trolls and bots on social media, because a lot of the highest value interventions of humans influencing decisions taken behind closed doors.”Is enough happening to deter such intervention?The general consensus is: no.Giles said: “What it requires is security, counterintelligence and police forces being given the political direction and, and instructions to prioritise that, which is not something that we’ve seen happening publicly in this country today.”Yet a planned public consultation on reforming the approach to the ransomware crisis was postponed when Sunak called the snap election.Ahmed also pointed out the lack of action from social media platforms, which he said need to “enforce their own rules”.He said at the moment they have an “abysmal track record of combating misinformation designed to mislead voters and undermine trust in the democratic process.”He said: “Generative AI is exciting and transformative – but in an online world dominated by vastly wealthy, unaccountable and irresponsible social media and AI companies, this technology also has the potential to turbo-charge the hate, lies and division that plague our societies.”Huesch had a more sympathetic approach.She said Russia’s goal of general disruption “makes it challenging” for anyone to respond: “How do you protect an abstract notion of trust that is neither easily measured, understood, nor [easy to] build?”She said the government has been taking it seriously, but warned that had not always been the case – as the 2020 Russia report found it had failed to properly assess Russian interference with the EU referendum of 2016.She added that the private sector needs to act because “it take the whole of society”, and we need to train ourselves to be “resilient against any disinformation”.How has the government responded to such warnings?In response to the parliamentary committee’s warning in May, a government spokesperson said: “Security is paramount and we are well prepared to ensure the integrity of the election, with robust systems in place to protect against interference.”Parliamentarians and election candidates were granted access to an “enhanced cyber security offer”, developed by the National Cyber Security Centre to protect against phishing attacks and foreign-influenced operations.Through the Defending Democracy Taskforce set up in 2022, the government said it announced ”£31m to protect our democratic processes and institutions”.“The National Security Act [of 2023] has additionally delivered a range of measures to strengthen the UK’s efforts to detect, deter and disrupt state threats,” the spokesperson added.Related...Support For Tories Is 'At Its Lowest Ever In British Polling History,' Elections Guru SaysRishi Sunak Booed And Heckled During Brutal Sky News Election GrillingGrant Shapps Squirms When Asked If Rishi Sunak Called Election Too Early",How Worried Should We Actually Be About Election Interference?,9,3
0,"A Conservative candidate has been criticised for sending letters to British-Pakistani voters allegedly insinuating they should vote for him instead of his Labour rival because of her Indian surname.Marco Longhi, the Tory candidate fighting for re-election in Dudley North against Sonia Kumar, has been accused of using dog-whistle politics and attempting to “alienate British Hindus”.In a letter to “voters of the British Pakistani/Kashmiri community in Dudley”, Longhi asked if the Labour candidate would speak for Kashmir in parliament. Kumar’s name was in bold, capitalised and underlined.Rishi Sunak has been called to withdraw his support for Longhi and condemn the letter.Related: Harold, Denise, Alison and Mark: Tories’ hypothetical target voters are all white, document revealsAnneliese Dodds, the chair of the Labour party, said: “This is clearly inappropriate, divisive, dog-whistle politics from the Conservatives. There is no place for such behaviour anywhere in our political system.“Rishi Sunak needs to take action immediately. If he fails to do so, it will show his promise of professionalism and accountability to be a hollow sham.”Kumar is a common Indian surname, with Hindu origins. As of 2014, 97% of all known holders of the surname were residents of India.There is no written record in Hansard of Longhi having brought up Kashmir in the chamber since he became an MP in 2019.Dodd’s comments were echoed by Labour’s candidate for Leicester East, Rajesh Agrawal, who classed the letter as a “shameful attempt to divide the area that Mr Longhi claims to represent”. Agrawal said it was “offensive to both Muslim and Hindu communities”.“There should be zero tolerance of the dog-whistle politics Mr Longhi is engaged in. Rishi Sunak should immediately remove Conservative party support for Mr Longhi’s campaign and apologise for attempting to alienate British Hindus,” he added.defaultKrish Raval, chair of Labour’s group for Indians, also criticised the letter, and the prime minister for failing to call out the divisive politics.“We find Marco Longhi’s comments racist, dangerous and wholly divisive,” Raval said, adding: “It is also disheartening to see an Indian-origin leader of the Conservatives let anti-Indian racism run rife through his party.”Sunder Katwala, director of the British Future thinktank, said: “Different parties, and candidates, have in past got into trouble making pitches to voters of one ethnicity/faith background that could harm the party if seen by voters of another background. It should not happen – especially in such brazen prejudiced form.“Obviously, any representative in parliament ought to be able to represent constituents of different ethnic and faith backgrounds. In my view any of the major parties should suspend a candidate for doing this.”Longhi later doubled down on his letter, telling GB News: “This is politics, isn’t it? Do you want someone who has consistently been supportive of Kashmiris where there have been human rights abuses or do you want someone called Sonia Kumar who no one has ever heard of?”The Guardian has contacted Longhi for comment.",Tory candidate accused of dog-whistle tactics against rival with Indian name,8,8

Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour Party leader, is so far the only major party leader to confirm his attendance, with Rishi Sunak, John Swinney and Sir Ed Davey also invited.The debate schedule builds up to what is expected to be the final televised programme of the election campaign, which will be another head to head between Sir Keir and the Conservative leader on June 26 – a week before the nation goes to the polls.What channel are the debates on?ITV and the BBC have confirmed they will host general election debates over the campaign.The programmes will be available on BBC1, BBC News and ITV1, as well as live on their streaming platforms BBC Iplayer and ITVX.For those watching from Scotland, the ITV debates will be on the equivalent channel STV.ITV also streamed the first debate on June 4 live on their Youtube channel and are expected, along with the BBC, to do the same for the following programmes.The BBC have also confirmed they will air their debates on local radio.Sky’s debate will be available to watch on Freeview and can be streamed online at the Sky News website or on social media.The Telegraph will be providing live coverage of all the debates with expert analysis and reaction.Question Time special - June 20, 8pm on the BBCOn Thursday June 20,  the BBC will return to host a Question Time Leader’s special with rrepresentatives of the UK’s four largest parties: the Conservatives, Labour Party, SNP and Liberal Democrats.Fiona Bruce will lead the broadcast from 8pm to 10pm in York and speak to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who has confirmed his attendance, with Rishi Sunak, John Swinney and Sir Ed Davey also invited.

That afternoon, an umbrella-less Mr Sunak announced his snap election decision and set in motion the vote to happen six weeks later on July 4.The choice means that Mr Sunak will have been in No 10 for 618 days by the polling date and has been called a “mistake” by figures like Prof Sir John Curtice, the polling expert.Why is there an election now?Tory figures close to general election planning had also been working under the assumption there was not going to be a summer ballot, but that all changed on May 22.Lord Cameron cut a trip to Albania short in order to return to a Cabinet meeting and Grant Shapps delayed a flight to a Nato meeting two hours to be there.On the day of the announcement, news came that the rate of inflation had fallen even further than expected, which Mr Sunak hailed as a sign that “everything is heading in the right direction”.With the Government’s record perhaps at its strongest on the economy, the Prime Minister was keen to use the news as a launchpad for triggering the election – but what else played into his decision?Key factors for the Prime Minister would have included whether economic statistics was continuing to improve, and whether polling and focus group research suggested that voters were feeling the positive effects of the National Insurance cuts, crediting the Tories for the boost.Getting Rwanda deportation flights off the ground also strengthened the case for going to the polls in the summer, along with a steady decline in the NHS elective waiting list.It had been rumoured that figures in Downing Street were mulling over whether it would be in the Tories’ interests to trigger a ballot sooner rather than later, despite being way behind Labour in the polls.Why was the general election not on the same day as the local elections?The general election could have been called on May 2 - the same day as the locals - but Rishi Sunak made the decision to avoid a spring poll.The Institute for Government pointed out that a spring election would avoid the risk that “a heavy defeat in the local elections could increase pressure on the Prime Minister – including from within his party – and make it difficult to regain momentum ahead of an election that would by then be less than a year away”.However, that opportunity passed. On March 14, the Prime Minister ruled out a national ballot on May 2, confirming there “won’t be a general election on that day”.It was thought that heavy losses at the locals could tempt restless Tory MPs to mount a challenge against their leader.However, despite a dire set of results for the Conservatives, resulting in hundreds of council seats lost, the rebels appear to have backed off for now.What happens next? Following Mr Sunak’s announcement on May 22, Parliament was prorogued and dissolved eight days later on May 30 after the Prime Minister was granted permission by the King Charles.Prorogation happened on May 24, in line with the 2022 Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act that sets out polling day to take place 25 working days following the dissolution on May 30, landing the general election on July 4.Election candidates have begun to use the six-week lead up to ballot day to campaign for their parties, including both Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer who have undertaken appearances up and down the country.Both leaders, and many more political figures, have also taken part in TV election debates in a bid to win over voters and released their 2024 party manifestos, starting with the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives. It is up to each party when to publish its manifesto, but an analysis by the Institute for Government shows that all Labour and Conservative manifestos since 1997 have been launched between 18 and 29 days before the election.Voter registration is usually open until the 12th working day before polling day, which indicates that it will close towards the end of June.How are general elections called?It is up to the Prime Minister to decide when to hold a national vote, but this power has only been restored in recent years.In 2011, the Fixed Term Parliaments Act effectively put the House of Commons in charge, with general elections held every five years unless a majority of MPs willed it otherwise.For an election to be called early, two thirds of the House had to back the plans. This is how Theresa May’s snap election was triggered in 2017. Alternatively, MPs could spark a ballot by passing a vote of no confidence in the Government.After trying and failing three times to secure the necessary two thirds majority for an early vote in 2019, the Tories opted to circumvent the law with a new purpose-built piece of legislation - the Early Parliamentary General Election Act - which required only a simple majority to pass. This paved the way for Boris Johnson’s snap election in 2019.The Government went on to repeal the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, replacing it with the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act. This new law stripped the Commons of its power to block an early ballot, putting the Prime Minister back in control.Traditionally, the Prime Minister travels to Buckingham Palace to request the dissolution of Parliament, before returning to Downing Street to announce the forthcoming election.How often are elections called? Each Parliament must be dissolved for a general election by the fifth anniversary of the day it first met.This measure was passed under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act by the 2011 coalition government, which set in stone the five-year periods between general elections.Elections may be held earlier – such occurred in 2017 with Theresa May and 2019 by Boris Johnson following a Brexit deadlock – under special circumstances.However, local elections such as the May 2024 by-elections and mayoral elections operate on a different time scale. Who can vote in the general election?The vast majority of UK adults can vote in a general election.In order to vote, you must:be registered to votebe 18 or over on the day of the election (‘polling day’)be a British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizenbe a resident at an address in the UK or Gibraltar, or living abroad and registered as an overseas voter (it is also possible to register if you have no fixed address)not be legally excluded from voting (for example, if you are serving a prison sentence)When should I register to vote?The deadline for registering to vote is usually midnight at the end of the 12th working day before polling day, meaning voter registration is open until June 18 at 11.59pm.When will polling take place?Parliament was dissolved a few days after the election announcement and polling day takes place 25 working days after that.The Civil Service has entered “purdah” – the period between an election being called and polling day which involves strict restrictions on the work of officials to ensure that Whitehall resources are not being used to benefit any party in particular.",When is the general election?

315,"The SNP will face the first national election on July 4 since Nicola Sturgeon stood down as SNP leader in March last year.The Scottish Nationalists won 48 of Scotland’s Westminster seats in the 2019 election but polls suggest they are on course to lose at least half at the general election thanks to a combination of a resurgent Labour Party, the Scottish Government’s unpopularity and a series of scandals, including a long-running police investigation into the party’s finances.John Swinney, who replaced the disastrous Humza Yousaf as SNP leader and First Minister, is expected to steady the ship and paper over some of the party’s yawning divisions in his manifesto, which will be launched at a campaign event in Edinburgh today.However, Mr Swinney was not a success in his first stint as SNP leader – between 2000 and 2004 – when he was ousted after overseeing two poor election results. Although a more seasoned politician now, he lacks the popular appeal of Ms Sturgeon.Many of the policy areas which will be debated in the election, such as education and health, are devolved to the Scottish Government at Holyrood. However, they are still likely to be debated in the general election campaign.Poll tracker: Conservatives falling as general election looms?Follow The Telegraph’s general election live coverageWhen will manifestos be released officially?John Swinney will launch the SNP’s official 2024 manifesto at a campaign event in Edinburgh today.It will be the last of the UK’s seven main political parties to release its blueprint for the nation, with Reform UK having published their document on Monday and Labour and the Conservatives releasing theirs last week.Here is a look at what the SNP could include in its 2024 election manifesto:IndependenceTax and spendingEconomyHealth and social careDefence and foreign affairsBrexitImmigrationEnergyEnvironmentIndependenceDemand negotiations with UK Government for another referendumProposal for party ‘independence’ logo to appear on ballot paperBefore he quit as First Minister, Humza Yousaf pledged that page one, line one of the manifesto will state: “Vote SNP for Scotland to become an independent country.”Following a series of policies being adopted and quickly dropped, the SNP has settled on a plan to demand negotiations with the UK Government for another independence referendum if the party wins a majority of the 57 seats that will be contested in Scotland, following boundary changes.It is highly unlikely that either Rishi Sunak or Sir Keir Starmer would agree to any such demand after the election. However, support for independence is polling much higher than backing for the SNP.The SNP hope the pledge will win back some of the independence supporters who have deserted the party in recent months and motivate them to turn out on election day.The party has even proposed new logos with “SNP independence” or “SNP for independence” to appear on general election ballot papers.Tax and spendingNational Insurance and inheritance tax devolved£12 billion wealth taxIncrease spending on affordable housingCap supermarket pricesReintroduce mortgage interest tax reliefThe SNP has already made Scotland the highest taxed part of the UK thanks to their control of income tax bands and rates. For 2024/25 there are six income tax bands in Scotland compared to three south of the border.Shona Robison, the SNP Finance Secretary, has made clear her opposition to the Chancellor’s decision to cut personal taxes in his Autumn and Spring Budgets, arguing the funding should instead have been spent on public services.To avoid another “damaging decade” of austerity, the SNP will argue for both Labour and the Tories to abandon their fiscal rules and focus on spending.The SNP has previously supported full fiscal autonomy – Scotland having control over all taxation north of the border – as a stepping stone to independence.The manifesto could propose the devolution of taxes such as National Insurance and inheritance tax with a view to hiking rates for wealthier Scots.In addition to scrapping non-dom tax status, the SNP has called for the UK Government to increase capital gains tax, tax share buybacks and increase taxes on those earning more than £100,000.A £12 billion wealth tax has also been proposed by the Nationalists, although there are scant details on how this would be assessed and collected.Ms Robison has also called for a huge increase in capital spending, particularly on affordable housing, arguing this would stimulate economic growth.Among their other spending proposals to help families with the cost of living are reintroducing mortgage interest tax relief, capping supermarket food prices, and copying the £25-per-week Scottish Child Payment for poorer families across the UK.EconomyIndependence would result in better economic performanceHighlight growth rates in other small countries in EuropeThe manifesto will likely point to the economic crisis that occurred during Liz Truss’s short-lived government, and the UK’s sluggish growth rates over recent years.It is expected to argue that Scotland would perform much better after independence, highlighting growth rates in other small countries in Europe.Health and social careCall for £15 billion increase in health spending in EnglandExtra £1.5 billion funding generated through the Barnett formulaAlthough control of the Scottish NHS is devolved to the SNP government, expect the party’s manifesto to call for a massive increase in health spending in England. Ahead of March’s Spring Budget, the Nationalists called for a £15 billion increase.This would generate an extra £1.5 billion funding for the Scottish Government through the Barnett formula, which could be used on Scotland’s struggling NHS.Defence and foreign affairsRemoval of UK’s Trident nuclear deterrent from FaslaneImmediate ceasefire in GazaCreation of separate Palestinian stateThe SNP has long called for the removal of Britain’s Trident nuclear deterrent from its Faslane base on the Clyde. Before the 2019 election, Nicola Sturgeon said it would be a red line for the SNP if it were to back any Labour government.The SNP has generally supported the UK Government’s stance on the Ukraine conflict but has taken a much more pro-Palestine stance over the conflict in Gaza. Mr Yousaf, whose wife is Palestinian, has accused Israel of inflicting a “collective punishment” on the people of Gaza in response to the Hamas terror attack.Expect the manifesto to include demands for an immediate ceasefire and the creation of a separate Palestinian state.BrexitVote SNP to ‘exit Brexit’EU single market benefits from independenceMr Yousaf previously urged Scots to vote SNP to “exit Brexit”, in a rehash of the 2017 and 2019 election campaigns. More than six out of 10 Scots voted Remain in the EU referendum and more recent polling on the issue has suggested this stance has not changed.With neither the Tories or Labour planning to rerun the referendum, expect the SNP manifesto to argue that the only way for Scotland to be part of the EU and to gain the benefits of the single market is to become independent.ImmigrationReturn of free movement from the EUPowers to issue work permits to foreignersIntroduce post-study and family visasMore welcome regime for asylum seekersScotland’s working age population is expected to shrink over the coming decades, creating a demographic timebomb with fewer working people to pay for services for a larger number of elderly pensioners.The SNP favours a much more liberal immigration policy than the UK Government, including the return of free movement from the EU.It also wants Holyrood to have powers to issue work permits to foreigners, based on the distinctive needs of the Scottish economy. New working visas, five-year post-study visas and family visas with much lower barriers than the UK currently uses would be introduced.The SNP has called for a much more welcome regime for asylum seekers and his government has argued that an independent Scotland would allow them to work and claim benefits.EnergyExpansion in onshore and offshore wind turbines£400 annual energy bill discount for householdsScrap electricity and gas standing chargesSocial energy tariff to assist households with disabled peopleThe party has a difficult political tightrope to walk over the future of North Sea oil and gas, which is responsible for around 90,000 highly paid jobs in Scotland.On June 3, during a debate between Scottish party leaders, Mr Swinney refused to say whether the SNP would back new oil and gas exploration there.As part of the SNP’s environmental agenda, it has argued for a presumption against further exploration being allowed. Mr Yousaf attacked the UK Government’s decision last September to give the green light to Rosebank, the UK’s largest untapped field.But the Nationalists are facing a difficult fight to hold their seats in the north east of Scotland, where most of the oil jobs are based.Stephen Flynn, the SNP’s Westminster leader and Aberdeen South MP, is expected to exert pressure on Mr Yousaf to tone down some of the party’s anti-oil rhetoric.The SNP recently opposed Labour’s plan to raise the windfall tax on fossil fuels from 75 per cent of excess profits to 78 per cent, while also extending it to 2029. He said there was  “extreme anger” from people in the north east of Scotland at the proposal.The SNP has repeatedly boasted of Scotland’s wind power potential so expect the manifesto to propose an overhaul in the subsidy regime to achieve a massive expansion in the number of onshore and offshore turbines.The Nationalists have also called on the UK Government to introduce a £400 annual energy bill discount for households and to scrap electricity and gas standing charges.A social energy tariff to assist households with disabled people with their energy bills would also be introduced, under their proposals.EnvironmentTurbocharge investment in green energyCall for UK-wide deposit return scheme to include glassSpeed up the roll-out of heat pumpsMs Sturgeon and Mr Yousaf made the transition to net zero one of the tenets of their tenure as First Minister. The SNP is in coalition at Holyrood with the hard-Left Scottish Greens, who have two ministers in his government.They have introduced legally binding targets for Scotland to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045 – five years earlier than the UK as a whole. However, interim targets were recently scrapped, a move that contributed significantly to the divorce with the Greens.The SNP has taken up Labour’s abandoned plan to spend at least £28 billion a year to “turbocharge investment in green energy”.The Scottish Nationalists opposed Rishi Sunak’s decision to delay the ban on new petrol and diesel from 2030 to 2035.The manifesto could also call for a UK-wide deposit return scheme that includes glass after attempts to introduce one in Scotland only descended into a debacle.It is also expected to include measures to dramatically speed up the roll-out of heat pumps, with auditors warning only 5,000 were installed in 2022, far short of the Scottish Government’s target of 25,000 per year.Can you vote for the SNP in England?The SNP have only ever fielded candidates in Scotland and will not be contesting any seats in England or Wales.Standing candidates outside of Scotland runs counter to the party’s central aim of negotiating another independence referendum.",SNP manifesto 2024: What will party’s election promises be?,9,11

88,"JOHN Swinney has confirmed an SNP victory in the General Election would be taken as a mandate to ask Westminster for a second independence referendum.The First Minister said the Scottish Government’s series of white papers constituted the SNP’s preparations for this outcome.Speaking at the launch of the SNP’s manifesto on the outskirts of Edinburgh, Swinney said he believed his party already had a mandate for independence from the pro-Yes majority delivered by the 2021 Scottish Parliament elections.Humza Yousaf (below), Swinney’s predecessor, had said during his time in office that an SNP victory, defined as winning the majority of Scottish seats, could lead directly to negotiations on Scotland’s exit from the Union.Swinney previously told the BBC the negotiations ""should involve Scotland having a referendum"".But his comments today confirm the request for an independence referendum would be the ""purpose"" of the negotiations.READ MORE: John Swinney rows back on SNP's 'independence negotiations' pledge in BBC interviewSpeaking at the Patina events centre in Edinburgh on Wednesday, Swinney said: “I believe the best way for Scotland to become an independent country, in a way that will address all of the democratic questions, the important questions, is for there to be a referendum.“That’s what I think is the right way to do it so that will be the purpose of the negotiations that I would take forward in the aftermath of the election.”Asked about comments from Dundee-born Hollywood actor Brian Cox (above) who said he feared the SNP were backing off the idea of independence, Swinney said: “A future made in Scotland, I think that’s a pretty clear commitment to independence right on the front cover of our manifesto.READ MORE: SNP launch General Election manifesto with pledge to 'deliver independence'“And then if we open up the manifesto – ‘vote SNP for Scotland to become an independent country’.“I think that that’s quite clear, or I hope it’s clear enough anyway.”On the SNP’s preparations for negotiations with Westminster on asking for indyref2, Swinney added: “As you’ll be familiar with, there’s been good work done within the Scottish Government on a series of documents to prepare the arguments and the mechanisms around independence and that’s exactly what the Scottish Government would take forward in the aftermath of this election to prepare for independence and to ensure that we’re successful in delivering the outcome of this election.”",John Swinney says SNP election victory will see party request indyref2,9,10
33,"Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak should not have their convictions removed for breaking Covid rules, Keir Starmer has said, amid calls from Conservative former cabinet ministers to nullify criminal convictions for Covid rule-breakers.Starmer said they should not have their convictions removed, though ex-ministers have made the case that 28,000 people who were given the convictions should have their slates wiped clean.The Labour leader said it was wrong for that to apply to the then prime minister and chancellor, who were fined amid the Partygate investigation when they attended a birthday gathering for Johnson.Starmer said: “Seriously, they want Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak’s convictions to be removed? Some great amnesty? Come on.“Many, many people paid a very high price in that pandemic. They don’t understand how deep that goes. The now prime minister and his predecessor but one are convicted of breaking the rules that they put in place and if they don’t understand how deep that goes it just reinforces how out of touch they are.”Related: Civil war, what civil war? The so-called Tory moderates never even put up a fight | Rafael BehrRobert Buckland, who was justice secretary during the pandemic, said it was unfair the convictions could bar people from jobs such as teaching, social work or police roles, especially given how young many offenders were.Guardian research last year found there had been more than 28,000 convictions for Covid-related offences, such as attendance at gatherings during lockdowns or arriving at airports without the proper evidence of a coronavirus test. Almost 16,000 of the convictions – or 55% – involved people under 30.Buckland told the Telegraph it was “not proportionate or necessary at a time when we want to encourage and support as many people back to work as possible”, adding: “I would wipe the slate clean.”David Davis, another former cabinet minister, told the newspaper he believed also there should be an amnesty. “Much of the Covid regulation was heavy-handed, unnecessary and penalised people wrongly. For this to turn into a lifetime penalty is a shameful disgrace and we should correct it as soon as possible.”The average fine issued in magistrates courts in 2022 was £6,000, although some people have been fined as much as £10,000.Nearly 125,000 fixed-penalty notices were issued in England and Wales during the pandemic, ranging from £50, such as that received by Johnson for attending a party with 30 people while he was prime minister, to fines of £10,000 given to others for similar offences. Those that were paid went no further.","Johnson and Sunak should retain Covid convictions, says Starmer",9,8
195,"Rishi Sunak has hit back at billionaires Sir Jim Ratcliffe and John Caudwell after the two senior business figures announced they were backing Labour.The Prime Minister said the pair “can probably afford Labour’s tax rises”, unlike the “tens of millions” of people “working really hard” who would be stung by a fresh blow to their finances.Sir Jim, who is the UK’s second-richest man, and Mr Caudwell, a lifelong Tory, both announced this week that they were backing Labour to form the next government.Sir Jim, the co-owner of Manchester United, said voters had “had enough” of Mr Sunak’s policies, while Mr Caudwell, the founder of Phones4U, branded the Prime Minister an “absolute dud”.Asked about the endorsements on Wednesday, the Prime Minister told LBC: “They are two of Britain’s richest men, they can probably afford Labour’s tax rises, but for tens of millions of people who are working really hard, they can’t.”The Tories have put tax attacks front and centre of their campaign, accusing Labour of wanting to hike the burden on families by £2,000.Sir Keir Starmer has dismissed the figure as “garbage” and claimed Mr Sunak had “deliberately” lied to the British public by repeatedly peddling the claim during a TV debate.‘An absolute dud’Mel Stride, the Work and Pensions Secretary, earlier said it was “completely wrong” of Mr Caudwell to have called Mr Sunak an “absolute dud”, pointing to new figures showing inflation falling back to the 2 per cent target for the first time in nearly three years.The billionaires’ support comes after Sir Keir and the Labour Party spent months courting the business world in a bid to win back support from those spooked by the Jeremy Corbyn years.Sir Jim, who is based in Monaco, was a prominent Brexiteer but has criticised the Tories’ handling of the UK’s exit from the EU.Mr Caudwell became a billionaire after founding retailer Phones4U - Maja Smiejkowska/ReutersThe endorsement of Sir Keir marks a change in attitude for the entrepreneur, who has often criticised Labour in the past.He told Bloomberg: “The Conservatives now have had a fairly long stint and they’ve put forward a whole series of prime ministers that haven’t been terribly successful.“Everybody in the UK now, you can see that the mood in the UK is ready for a change, they’ve had enough.“I’ve met Keir Starmer a couple of times, I like Keir. I think he’ll do a very sensible job.”Mr Caudwell, who donated £500,000 to the Conservatives ahead of the 2019 election, said he had been “rather despairing” at the party’s performance for “many years”.“Only five years ago, I donated half a million to the Conservatives to help avert the disaster that would have been Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street,” he said.Tory failuresHe added: “But I’ve been increasingly critical of Tory failures since then, particularly over Rishi’s mismanagement of the economy during Covid, Boris’s lowering of ethical standards – and, of course, associated with the accusation that Tory cronies benefited improperly regarding Covid PPE – and then the Liz Truss debacle.”Mr Caudwell said he had been impressed when he attended the launch of Labour’s manifesto on Thursday last week and praised Sir Keir for transforming the party “beyond belief” since Mr Corbyn’s leadership.However, he criticised Labour’s plan to introduce VAT on private school fees, saying he was “not convinced that this is a positive policy”.","Starmer’s new billionaire backers can afford tax hikes, says Sunak",9,11
207,"Rishi Sunak has said he will not hand back money from the Conservative party’s biggest donor, who said Diane Abbott should be shot, because the businessman is “genuinely contrite”.A caller during an LBC phone-in asked the prime minister about Frank Hester’s remarks about the Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP.The Guardian revealed Hester had said during a meeting in 2019 that Abbott made him want to “hate all black women” and that she “should be shot”. After the report, Abbott made a complaint to the Metropolitan police.Hester, who has given more than £15m to the Tories directly or through his company, is also alleged to have referred to a staff member as the “token Muslim”, imitated people of Chinese descent and remarked that one individual was attractive for a black woman, according to former employees who spoke to the Guardian.Hester apologised for the Abbott comments, which were widely condemned as racist and misogynistic, but did not respond to requests to comment on other claims.On Wednesday, an LBC caller told the prime minister: “Just saying he’s apologised isn’t going to cut it.”Sunak appeared to insinuate that there was an equivalence between Hester and some remarks Abbott has made, as he said Abbott herself had made “some comments in the past that were not appropriate but she apologised for those and was readmitted back into the Labour party”.“Maybe we disagree on this, but I believe if people are genuinely contrite … that should be accepted,” Sunak told the caller.“I do think that in life if you made a mistake and honestly apologised and learned from it, as a society if that is something we can come together on, [that] is important.”The accusations against Hester had piled pressure on Sunak after it was confirmed that the donor had given a further £5m to the Tories through his healthcare tech company, the Phoenix Partnership (TPP). It brings the total donated by Hester to more than £15m in a year.This equates to more than 40% of the total national spending limit for each party in the general election.Sunak is yet to comment on the latest allegations of comments made by Hester about race or religion in the workplace or on work trips.After the Guardian reported details of claims by former employees about his workplace behaviour, Sunak was asked by a reporter while on a campaign visit in Wiltshire earlier this month if Hester should apologise for the latest alleged remarks. He declined to comment.A Conservative spokesperson said Hester had “rightly apologised for comments made in the past”. Hester issued an apology for “rude” remarks about Abbott, denying they were motivated by race or gender, and saying he “abhorred racism”. All of the latest allegations were put to Hester. He did not respond to the claims.After Sunak skipped a key part of the D-day commemorations, the Liberal Democrats urged him to donate money Hester had given them to a veterans’ charity.Ed Davey said Sunak’s snub of a key international D-day event was “a letdown for our whole country”.On a campaign visit to Victoria Park in Newbury, Berkshire, the Lib Dem leader told broadcasters: “I’ve felt pretty cross about this. I’ve talked to veterans and they feel quite angry. So, I think they need to do more.“I think the Conservative party should give £5m of that donation to a veterans’ charity. I think if they did that, then people might be able to draw the line.”",Rishi Sunak says Tories will not give Frank Hester his money back,9,8

160,"Rachel Reeves has clarified Sir Keir Starmer’s definition of “working people” days after the party pledged not to raise taxes on workers if it got into power.The shadow chancellor backed up the promise in the party’s manifesto in a video message where she said she would not put up income tax, National Insurance or VAT.But after Sir Keir appeared to omit pensioners and savers when asked for his definition of “working people”, senior Tories claimed it indicated the party actually intended to raise taxes.Asked what he meant by “working people” in a radio interview on LBC on Tuesday, Sir Keir said: “People who earn their living, rely on our [public] services and don’t really have the ability to write a cheque when they get into trouble” he said.“So the sort of people I’m meeting pretty well every day now. It’s quite a big group because these days there are many people obviously not so well off.”Rachel Reeves told Kay Burley that ‘working people’ didn’t mean people without savings (Sky News)But on Wednesday, Ms Reeves appeared to distance herself from her leader’s definition when asked on both Sky News and BBC Radio 4.Ms Reeves told the Today programme: “Working people are people who get their income from going out to work every day, and also pensioners that have worked all their lives and are now in retirement, drawing down on their pensions.”She added: “Many working people do have savings, but the truth is, during the cost-of-living crisis, loads of working people have had to run down those savings and have very little left, very little to draw upon.”And speaking to Kay Burley, who put Sir Keir’s definition to her several times, Ms Reeves said: “Some people who go out to work haven’t been able to build up savings, many other people who go to work have had to run down their savings.“But there are many people who do have savings and have been able to save up and those are working people as well.”Following Sir Keir’s interview on LBC, Jeremy Hunt told The Telegraph Sir Keir had “let slip Labour’s true plans” to raise taxes across the board.“Under pressure, Starmer has finally made it clear that Labour would raise taxes on millions of hardworking people who they don’t deem to meet their narrow and misguided definition of ‘working’,” he said.On the announcement of a drop in inflation to the target 2 per cent, Ms Reeves also told Sky News she welcomed the news, but added the cost-of-living crisis was not over and that the prices faces by many families were still not falling.Prime minister Rishi Sunak said the inflation fall from 2.3 per cent in April to 2 per cent in May showed the economy had “turned a corner”.",Rachel Reeves and Keir Starmer clash over whether working people have savings after Labour tax pledge,9,9
89,"JOHN Swinney has launched the SNP's General Election manifesto with a pledge to ""deliver independence"" and put ""the interests of the people of Scotland first"".With just a few weeks to go until voters head to the polls, Swinney has laid out his party's priorities in his first manifesto launch since becoming First Minister. You can read the full speech delivered in Edinburgh this morning below.John Swinney's full election manifesto launch speechGood morning – and welcome to the launch of the SNP manifesto for the 2024 Westminster election.This election takes place at a time when people are hurting.The aftermath of Covid has left scars amongst our people.The cost of living crisis has meant people are worried about their future and the wellbeing of their loved ones.We are living in a period of rapid change where new technology, the climate emergency and the implications of an ageing population will all have a profound impact on the way we live our lives in the future.Given this atmosphere of turmoil, more than ever I believe political leaders and political parties need a set of values as a foundation from which to respond to those challenges.I believe people are crying out for principled leadership which is prepared to argue for what it believes in.So today, as I launch the SNP manifesto for the 2024 General Election, let me set out the core values of the Scottish National Party that anchor our proposition to the people of Scotland.We are a moderate left of centre party in the mainstream of Scottish public opinion, firmly rooted in the ideas of inclusion and internationalism.We will always put the interests of people in Scotland first – wherever our people were born; wherever our people come from.And at the very heart of our beliefs is the principle that decisions about Scotland should be made by the people who live in Scotland.Why? For the simple reason that no-one else cares as much about this wonderful country, and no-one else will do a better job of taking care of it, now and in the future, than the people who live here.It is through independence therefore that we believe we can build the fairer country and the more prosperous economy we know is possible.Not independence for its own sake.Independence for the powers to protect our NHS and to help people through tough times.Independence for a stronger economy, and happier, healthier lives.And independence for a better future for Scotland – made in Scotland – for Scotland.It is those values that govern our overall approach and the content of this manifesto.So let me outline the choice the SNP offers to the people of Scotland at this election.First and foremost, we are the only major party arguing for an end to the spending cuts.The arbitrary Tory fiscal rules, adopted by Labour, bake-in more eye-watering cuts.18 billion pounds of cuts.The SNP manifesto argues for new, sensible fiscal rules. Rules that will: end the cuts, reverse the 1.3 billion pounds cut to Scotland’s capital budget, and invest in public services, starting with the Health Service.We will join with progressive politicians south of the border to press for greater funding for the NHS and for the UK government to match the pay deals we have given our health staff in Scotland.That would see an extra £1.6 billion for the NHS in Scotland.And we would introduce a “Keep the NHS in Public Hands Bill” at Westminster.A legal guarantee for a publicly owned, publicly operated health service.The SNP message on the health services is clear, it is simple and it will never change.The NHS is not for sale.Voting SNP is a vote to protect our public services and our precious NHS.Friends,I have made clear the focus of my Government will be to eradicate child poverty.The 2-child benefit cap makes things worse.It is the exact opposite of what the UK government should be doing.Introduced by an uncaring Conservative Government, it is frankly beyond me that the prospective Labour Government plan, to keep this deeply damaging policy.SNP MPs will press for the 2-child benefit cap to be scrapped.Colleagues, the future of the 2 child cap is a simple test.Are you in government to help children out of poverty?Or are you so morally lost, that you push more kids into poverty?Our choice – to abolish the cap – is obvious and it is driven by our values.The same values that drive the SNP on so many issues, not least nuclear weapons.We will demand an end to the obscene waste of billions of pounds on a new generation of weapons of mass destruction.And, while we are talking about waste, SNP MPs will demand that the House of Lords is abolished.Our values, Scotland’s choices.Elected government not ermine clad cronies.Lift the 2-child cap not the cap on bankers’ bonuses.Bairns not bombs.And, investment not cuts.I believe these choices represent the values most of us share.They are Scotland’s values.And a vote for the SNP – a vote for this manifesto – is a vote for those values.Friends, every election is a choice.Over recent years, the outrageous Westminster power grab has been designed to reduce the choices Scotland can make for itself.That must stop.The devolution-busting Internal Market Act must be revoked.Westminster routinely passing laws in devolved areas without the consent of the Scottish Parliament must end.For Scotland’s workers we will support the end of exploitative zero hours contracts, the unacceptable practice of fire and rehire, and we will fight to scrap the so-called Minimum Services Level Act which is an attack on the right to strike.Fighting against Westminster austerity cuts, for our NHS, for better working conditions and against the Westminster power grab.Working whenever we can with others to promote practical, moderate left of centre policies – that is what we are offering the people of Scotland at this election.The SNP will stand up for Scotland at Westminster, and put Scotland’s interests first.But we know the Westminster system is broken – no matter how much we try to mitigate its impact.I think most people in Scotland know that.So our ambition is to transfer power from Westminster and into the hands of the people of Scotland.Taking decisions in Scotland, for Scotland works.Using the limited powers of the Scottish Parliament has had a real impact on people’s lives.The SNP has introduced a more progressive tax system to help fund the NHS and other public services.We’ve delivered the best performing core A and E services in the UK for nearly 10 years.We’re helping with the cost of living through free prescriptions, all day off-peak rail travel and free bus travel for young people.We’ve overseen a massive expansion in renewable energy and are already half way towards net zero.We’ve delivered many more affordable houses, per head of population, than England or Wales.I know, however, that we must constantly strive to strengthen our work in transforming the lives of people of Scotland.Through measures such as the Scottish Child Payment we’re keeping an estimated 100,000 children out of poverty.That is the SNP in government at Holyrood – working day in, day out to earn and re-earn the trust of people in Scotland.We will not always get everything right but we will always put the interests of Scotland first.The UK is going in a different direction – the wrong direction.Far too often the interests of Scotland are ignored altogether.I’ve spoken a lot in this campaign about the A B and C of Westminster imposed austerity cuts, Brexit and the cost of living crisis.Scotland wanted none of that.But they were imposed anyway.So today I want to introduce a D to that list: democracy.With independence, people in Scotland will always get the governments they vote for.That’s how democracy should work: engaging in respectful persuasion, taking account of everyone’s view, working together wherever possible in the national interest,And it is through the power of democracy that we will win our independence.There is no other way.We must never lose faith in the power of the democratic voice of the people of Scotland.In 2021 they voted for a Scottish Parliament with a clear majority for independence and for a referendum.That democratic choice must be respected.At this election we have the opportunity to reinforce the case for Scotland becoming an independent country.It is the substance of the case that will take us there.That starts with the economy.Scotland has resources and talent in abundance.We have extraordinary energy resources.A world-class food and drink sector.An incredible tourism offering.Brilliant universities.Thriving financial services and creative industries.And we are the forefront of the industries of the future such as offshore wind power.Since coming to office the SNP has grown both productivity and the Scottish economy faster per head than the UK.But most economic powers lie with Westminster.And the UK economy is failing far too many people.In an independent Scotland we could be back in the EU – for the first time as an equal member in our own right.We would be part of the huge Single Market, which by population is seven times the size of the UK.We would enjoy once again the benefits of European freedom of movement – vital for so many Scottish businesses.Our young people would have the opportunity again to study and work freely across Europe.And in turn we would welcome our fellow Europeans to Scotland.The SNP has funded one of Europe’s finest programmes dedicated to the creation of high growth businesses.With a potential market of 450 million people in the Single Market, think of the massive opportunity for further growth.Of course, an independent Scotland, like all countries would face challenges.Success would not be guaranteed.That would be determined by our own decisions as a country and the choice we make.But when we look at independent European countries similar to Scotland there are grounds for optimism and hope.Countries like Denmark, Ireland and Sweden are wealthier per head than the UK.They are fairer with lower inequality.They have higher productivity – the key driver of living standards.And they have lower poverty.So with all our resources; all our talent, with everything we have to offer and all our ambition – why not Scotland?In an independent Scotland people would have a constitutional right to access a system of health care free at the point of need.The threat of creeping Westminster privatisation would be over for good.Staffing in our health and care services would not be subject to a hostile Westminster migration policy.And our public services would not be subject to disastrous Westminster austerity policies.So never let anyone tell you that independence is separate from people’s daily concerns.It is fundamental to those concerns.It is about where decisions about Scotland are made.Decisions over our economy.Our health service.Our living standards.So on July the 4th I am asking you to vote SNP.I’m asking you to vote SNP to put the interests of people in Scotland first.I’m asking you to vote SNP for a future made in Scotland - for Scotland.Thank you.",In full: John Swinney's SNP election manifesto launch speech,9,10

But I will continue to stand up to the Labour Welsh Government.”The same field, near Trellech, with only the sign posts remaining. (Image: supplied)Mr Davies highlighted his opposition to the default 20 mile per hour speed limit in residential areas in Wales, which the Conservatives have claimed they would over rule the Senedd to overturn, funding for the NHS and the expansion of the Senedd as areas where he has challenged the Welsh Government.He added: “I will not be silenced. I will continue to stand up for the true interests of Monmouthshire.”Conservative Senedd Member for Monmouth, Peter Fox, said a field near Trellech, where posts have been left in the ground and posters promoting Mr Davies removed, has been used by the party for years.He said: “All of the posters were put up with the landowners’ permission we are always careful to obtain that.“Many of our posters are also asked for by the owners. The one pictured is a site we’ve used for many elections and the posters were erected by our campaign team.“This was the same for a run of five ripped down and removed at Llanlowell near Usk. Those particular ones have been replaced now. There are other examples around the county that already have been vandalised or removed.”READ MORE: Monmouthshire general election 2024 list of candidatesThere is no indication who is responsible for the removal or damage to any signs but a press release issued by Mr Davies warned “this is an illicit offence and classed as criminal damage, which could lead to prosecution”.Illicit means not allowed by law.Mr Fox said he hasn’t as yet reported the removal of the signs to the police.",David Davies' election signs are disappearing from the Monmouthshire countryside,9,6

216,"Rishi Sunak is predicted to become the first sitting prime minister ever to lose their seat at a general election.The Conservatives are also on track to slump to just 53 seats, with around three-quarters of the Cabinet voted out, a major opinion poll for The Telegraph has revealed.The Liberal Democrats are on course to be just behind the Tories on 50 MPs, according to the Savanta and Electoral Calculus polling analysis, leaving them in touching distance of becoming the official opposition.Labour is forecast to have 516 seats and an estimated House of Commons majority of 382 - double that won by Sir Tony Blair in 1997 - as Sir Keir Starmer becomes prime minister.Meanwhile Reform, despite a surge in the polls, is predicted to get zero seats. For Nigel Farage, the recently returned Reform leader, it would mean an eighth defeat as a parliamentary candidate in a row.The SNP, according to the poll, are predicted to slump to just eight MPs, down from 48 in 2019, with Labour once again the dominant party of Scotland as they were under Sir Tony.The polling suggests Tory warnings of a Labour “super-majority” are accurate. It also lays bare the scale of voter disillusionment with the Tories and suggests an uncertain road for the party in the years ahead.Other polling analyses in recent weeks have had the Tories slumping markedly, sometimes below 100 seats. But none have had them performing quite this badly.This is the first poll of its kind to forecast Labour to win more than 500 seats. No other poll has predicted the Tories would win so few seats.The polling from Savanta for The Telegraph consulted around 18,000 people between June 7 and June 18, capturing views throughout the last fortnight of the election campaign.The analysis comes from a method called Multilevel Regression and Post-stratification, or MRP, which allows pollsters to take survey results and predict results in individual seats.In simple terms, it involves talking to many more people than a typical poll - around ten times more - and drilling down into the demographic details of both respondents and constituencies.More than a hundred seats are predicted to be won by such narrow margins that the pollster believes they remain up for grabs.A small improvement in the Tory vote share could have a marked impact on their seat total.But the results, published with just a fortnight left before the general election, make clear that the Tories are facing a defeat of historic proportions from a frustrated electorate.Other MRP polling analyses in recent weeks have had the Tories slumping markedly, sometimes below 100 seats. But none have had them performing quite this badly.The explanation, according to Savanta, comes in the lead that Labour was found to have had over Conservatives, which was 21 percentage points - a little higher than other recent MRP polls.Savanta’s estimated voting intention has Labour on 44 per cent, the Conservatives on 23 per cent, Reform on 13 per cent, the Lib Dems on 12 per cent, the Greens on 4 per cent, the SNP on 3 per cent and Plaid Cymru on 1 per cent.The Tories falling so low in nationwide vote share means that not only are they predicted to lose scores of seats to Labour, but also lose out to the Lib Dems in a host of others.Securing 53 MPs would comfortably be the Conservatives’ worst result in modern history. It would be less than a third of the 165 MPs they got in 1997 when Sir Tony’s New Labour swept to power.It would also amount to a remarkable slump from 2019, when under Boris Johnson the Tories secured 365 MPs. It would mean the Tories keeping just 13 per cent of their 2019 seats.Mr Sunak is predicted to lose his Richmond seat to Labour, though this race is among those which Savanta says is still in the balance given the close margins.If that were to happen, it would be a moment of history. No prime minister has ever lost their seat at a general election, according to the Institute for Government.Arthur Balfour is the only prime minister to have come close to losing their seat. He resigned as prime minister in December 1905 and was officially the opposition leader when he lost his seat in the election at the start of 1906.The predicted result would also have a major impact on who could follow Mr Sunak as Tory leader, given many of those tipped to run next month if there is a defeat are predicted to lose their seats.Penny Mordaunt, the Commons Leader, Grant Shapps, the Defence Secretary, Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, and Robert Jenrick, the former migration minister, all lose their seats on this prediction.So too do Jeremy Hunt, the Chancellor, and James Cleverly, the Home Secretary, meaning that three of the four great offices of state holders would be swept out. The fourth, Lord Cameron, the Foreign Secretary, is not an MP.Reform, according to the Savanta polling analysis, would not win any seats, though given the rapid recent changes in the party’s profile, an extra element of doubt could apply to them.Mr Farage only became Reform leader a few days before this polling began, with an uptick in its vote being seen throughout the last fortnight. His impact on the seat of Clacton, where he is standing, is also hard to predict with nationwide polling.Reform’s polling increase means only recently has Savanta started putting it among the list of political parties offered up front as an option to respondents, rather than only after the select “other”.Plaid Cymru would be on four seats. The Greens would get zero seats. Seat projections are not made for Northern Ireland, given polling challenges because of party differences there.The general election is now just 15 days away.","Sunak to lose seat in Tory wipeout, major poll predicts",9,11
329,"The general election campaign is in full swing with party leaders travelling across the country announcing policies and speaking to voters. Over last month, there has been no shortage of gaffes and blunders, particularly from prime minister Rishi Sunak.From being soaked outside Number 10 as he called the snap election without an umbrella, to being asked if he was captaining a “sinking ship” when he visited Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the PM’s campaign has been far from ideal.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has also had his fair share of blunders. He has been spotted falling off a paddleboard, riding a waterslide in a rubber ring and skidding down a hill on a bike – all as part of his campaign trail.With 15 days until voters head to the polls, party communications teams will be hoping to avoid any more slip ups.The Independent has put together the best gaffes and blunders from the election campaign below.Rishi Sunak and the Conservative Party‘Things can only get wetter’: Sunak drenched as he announces electionThe campaign hadn’t even begun when the prime minister made his first mistake – swapping the £2.6 million Downing Street press briefing room for the Great British Outdoors.Heavy rain poured down on the prime minister, who spoke from a lectern outside No 10 without an umbrella.Labour’s 1997 theme Things Can Only Get Better by D:Ream was blasted from a speaker, drowning out Mr Sunak’s attempts to boast of his inflation achievements.Mr Sunak, wearing a suit with a light blue tie, became increasingly soaked during the speech.A few days later, the PM admitted he “was a bit wet” during the announcement.Own goal at Welsh brewery over national team’s Euros absenceOne day into the election trail, Mr Sunak asked staff at a brewery in Barry, South Wales,  if they were looking forward to this summer’s football, despite the national team not qualifiying for the Euros.But one of the pub workers was quick to correct him on his mishap, following Wales’s play-off final defeat to Poland in March.He interjected and said “Only if you support England!”, to which Mr Sunak awkwardly replied the hospitality industry was one the Conservatives supported.Captain of a “sinking ship” at the Titanic QuarterRishi Sunak wears a life jacket during his visit to the Titanic Quarter (Stefan Rousseau/PA Wire)The prime minister faced another blunder when asked by a reporter whether he was captaining a ""sinking ship"" during a visit to Northern Ireland's Titanic Quarter.The unfortunate question was asked when Mr Sunak visited Artemis Technologies, a local company which manufactures zero-emissions maritime technology with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Chris Heaton-Harris.“Are you captaining a sinking ship going into this election?” the reporter asked.To which an irked Sunak replied: “If you look at what’s happened over the past few weeks, you can see our plan is working.”Mr Heaton-Harris, who was standing right next to the PM, could be seen struggling to contain his grin.Questioned by a Tory councillor(Stefan Rousseau/PA Wire)In one of the first Q&A events at a distribution centre in Derbyshire, the PM took questions from supposedly random workers.Speaking to around 50 people, he was asked about his flagship plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda.He was told that the “biggest issue is going to be immigration over this election campaign” before he was asked whether “your Rwanda plan is going to see results and stop the small boats coming?”Broadcasters showed Prime Minister thanking the man for his “important question.”It later emerged the question had come from Conservative Leicestershire County councillor Ross Hills.Sunak stands below an exit sign(via REUTERS)On a

backfiresThe Labour Party turned an attempt by Mr Sunak to mock them into a viral post that looks like he is endorsing them. The Tories’ latest post on TikTok shows the prime minister explaining “Labour’s policy for our country’s future” on a flipchart.The short video sees him turn over the cover to show a blank page, before capping a pen in his hand, placing it down and walking off-camera.But Labour’s social media team were quick to hit back at the video with an edited version that showed Sir Keir Starmer’s “first steps for change” on the flipchart.The Labour Party post has now received over 2.4 million views on X and a further 308,000 on TikTok.Union Jack flag flying upside downIn the Conservative Party’s first election broadcast, the Union Jack depicted flying upside down.The prime minister’s video pointed to uncertain times fuelled by “pandemic, war in Europe and the Middle East, a reckless dictator in Russia… China”.“We face unprecedented challenges here at home because of global insecurity, but by sticking with the plan Rishi Sunak is steadying the ship and making progress,” a deep-voiced narrator says over footage of the PM working.But, just minutes after the video was released, it was pointed out that perhaps the most striking part of the video is a shot of the UK’s flag upside down.Sunak photobombed by Lib Dems boatThe prime minister was photobombed by Liberal Democrats campaigners on a boat as he spoke to rowers in Oxfordshire on Monday.The prime minister was visiting a riverside rowing club as Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper and a group of activists rode past on the water holding orange diamond-shaped voting placards. Campaigners could be seen waving at the PM.Of the stunt, a Lib Dem source told media: “This is just another small boat Rishi Sunak can’t deal with.”Flock of sheep flee as Rishi Sunak and David Cameron try to feed themA flock of sheep fled as Rishi Sunak and David Cameron tried to feed them during a campaign visit to Devon on 18 June.The prime minister and Lord Cameron entered the sheep’s pen with buckets full of food for the animals.“Come on,” Mr Sunak said as the flock ran to the other side of the pen.“They don’t want to play ball,” a farmer accompanying Mr Sunak said.Grant Shapps hangs up phone live on TV when asked about losing his seatDefence secretary Grant Shapps hung up the phone during a live interview when he was asked about losing his seat in the upcoming general election.A YouGov survey suggested the defence secretary could be voted out of parliament along with many of his Conservative colleagues.While presenting the polls’ results on Sky News on Monday deputy political editor Sam Coates spotted Shapps was calling him.The camera kept rolling as Coates answered and said: “Hello Grant Shapps, you’re live on Sky News.“I’m in the studio with Sophy Ridge. Have you seen you’re about to lose your seat, according to the Sky News-YouGov projection?”There was a moment’s silence before the phone emitted a few beeps, meaning Shapps was no longer there.Suella Braverman’s ‘cringey’ TikTok videoThe former home secretary was filmed doing a swaggering dance to the soundtrack of Fedde Le Grand and Ida Corr’s 2006 hit ‘Let Me Think About It’.She launched the new account on the social media platform last week with a handful of videos as part of her general election campaign, and it has already received tens of thousands of views.Keir Starmer and the Labour PartyStarmer draws laughter after mentioning toolmaking father...

We directly and legally and safely resettled 25,000 people from Syria and from refugee camps on Syria’s borders into the UK. That was the largest legal resettlement scheme in relation to Syria.”He added: “I’ve mentioned Ukraine already, 200,000 Ukrainians have been welcomed here to the UK, a similar number of people from Hong Kong fleeing oppression by the communist regime, and Afghanistan.”Challenged on those from Afghanistan waiting to be granted asylum to Britain, Mr Philp said: “The Home Office is working to bring those people safely into the United Kingdom and that work is happening as we speak.“So where there is a real need, then this country rightly welcomes people, but it does have to be done in a safe and legal way.

The first of those is peace and the second is prosperity. “He added: “People can become more prosperous by building businesses, and by exporting and importing. Now, the UK has recently jumped up the export league table. We’re now, I think, fourth in the world for exports.“But I’d like to see us using our free trade freedoms we now have to trade more with other countries, particularly in the developing world.”07:41 PM BSTLabour sets out how it intends to tackle the small boats crisisNick Thomas-Symonds has called the Rwanda scheme “completely unworkable” as he set out Labour’s plans for a Border Security Command to tackle small boat crossings.He told the Channel 4 debate: “We would scrap the Rwanda scheme, which is completely unworkable. They poured hundreds of millions of pounds down the drain to essentially send two volunteers, and a couple of Tory home secretaries, there so far.”He added: “There’s a small boat operations plan that’s part of Border Force. What our Border Security Command will do is bring together the Border Force, it will bring together immigration enforcement, it will bring together the Crown Prosecution Service international and, crucially, our security services.”Asked whether Labour would process the 40,000 asylum seekers who had come to the UK since 2023 and were “stuck in limbo”, Mr Thomas-Symonds said: “Well, that’s exactly what is going to have to happen.And what will happen then is those who are found to have no right to be here, we will get a proper enforcement and returns agreement in the Home Office, if we are privileged enough to govern, that will actually then deport people who are not entitled to be here.“That’s the flights that will be taking off on the Labour government, not wasting money on Rwanda.”07:24 PM BSTPictured: Voters wait for Nigel Farage ahead of Clacton Q&A eventVoters wait for Reform Party Leader Nigel Farage at the Princes Theatre in Clacton on Sea in Essex - Peter Macdiarmid/London News Pictures Ltd07:19 PM BSTGreens: Politicians ‘like to scapegoat migrants for problems with underfunding in public services’The co-leader of the Green Party has said that a number of politicians “like to scapegoat migrants for the problems with underfunding in public services”.Carla Denyer told the Channel 4 debate: “If you meet a migrant in the NHS, they’re more likely to be treating you than to be ahead of you in the queue.“Now some politicians, and unfortunately, the list of which politicians that is is getting longer, like to scapegoat migrants for the problems with underfunding in public services.“When in reality, the cause of that is decades of decisions to underfund those public services by political parties.”She added: “They could choose to make bold decisions about how you pay for public services and how you raise those funds, and the Green Party is the only party in England being honest about that.”07:11 PM BSTWatch: Richard Tice challenges Labour on net migrationRichard Tice, chairman of Reform UK, has challenged Labour on whether it had a target level of net migration.He asked Nick Thomas-Symonds on the Channel 4 debate: “What’s the number of net migration that you think is right for this country?“The Labour frontbencher responded: “Richard, a number is not a plan.”Mr Tice said: “The truth is that the Conservative Party have allowed mass immigration in the last two years deliberately, in complete contrast to what they promised election after election.”He added: “One person is arriving legally every minute. That means we need to build a new home just for those arriving every two minutes.”07:06 PM BSTPhilp: ‘No question’ the British public want lower net migrationThere is “no question” that the British public want lower net migration, Chris Philp has said.The Policing Minister was asked to respond to a Channel 4 poll that found that fewer people trusted the Conservatives on their pledge to cut net migration than Labour.Mr Philp told the Channel 4 debate: “Well, there’s no question that the British public want net migration to be lower. They’re right. We agree. It does need to be lower.He added: “There were about 200,000 or more from Ukraine and a similar number from Hong Kong.

We need those 20,000 additional places.“What we will do is change the planning rules. We will declare this of national importance”Chris Philp, the policing minister, told the Channel 4 debate: “Let me be clear that no one who is a threat to the public is ever going to get released early.“Last year, we had 35,000 more successful criminal justice outcomes than we had the previous year.

He needs to just do what he’s doing which is continue to show energy and enthusiasm and commitment and do the best he can.“One thing I would not do is take the advice of various people in the Tory Party, terrible advice they are giving him, which is to switch and become the lead negative campaigner for the Conservatives against Keir Starmer.“That would be a disaster for the party but also a disaster for him.”""That would be a disaster for the party but also for him"".

381,"With the general election edging ever closer, chancellor Jeremy Hunt is facing a “knife edge” battle to hold onto his seat.The Tories are still some way behind Labour in the polls, with some pollsters indicating that Reform UK – headed by Nigel Farage – are equal to or ahead of prime minister Rishi Sunak’s party. Hunt could be among the Conservative casualties on the night of the 4 July poll, despite his newly-created seat in Godalming and Ash currently holding a Conservative majority of more than 10,000.Hunt is facing a battle to win the seat in Surrey, with the Liberal Democrats keen on taking a high-profile scalp. The Conservatives are predicted to win 34% – with the Lib Dems just one percentage point behind. Hunt said the newly-created seat was “very marginal”, and told broadcasters he is “fighting for every vote”.The Ipsos poll is suggesting a large Labour majority in the general election. (Ipsos)Jeremy Hunt: My constituency is on a knife edgeHe added: “I think that I can win the seat. But I don’t take anything for granted.“It is on a knife edge. And that’s what I’m knocking on doors for, six hours every day, meeting lots of people, making the arguments.”Were Hunt to lose, he would potentially be the highest-profile Tory to be rejected by voters. However, several other Tory ‘big beasts’ also face a tight vote to hold onto their seat, according to a major poll by Ipsos.Grant ShappsDefence secretary Grant Shapps may lose his seat in the election. (Getty)Defence secretary Grant Shapps, who had been touted as a potential leader of the Conservatives after the election, is at risk of losing his Welwyn Hatfield seat, according to Ipsos. Their polling suggests a likely Labour victory, with Sir Keir Starmer’s party currently on 48%, compared to 28% for the Conservatives.Shapps won the seat in the 2019 election with a vote share of 52.6%, increasing his majority from the previous election.Penny MordauntPenny Mordaunt’s seat is at risk from Labour. (PA)Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons, is another Tory MP whose name has been mentioned in a future leadership contest – in the event of the Tories losing the election. However, she may not even be an MP after 4 July as her Portsmouth North seat is at risk.Seen as “leaning Labour”, polling suggests Labour are on 42%, compared to the Tories on 34%. She won 61.4% of the vote in the 2019 election.Liz TrussFormer prime minister Liz Truss may not be an MP after the election. (PA)Former prime minister Liz Truss is at risk in her South West Norfolk seat. The seat is seen as a “toss up”, with Truss currently in the lead at 31%. Labour are a sitting at 27% but Reform UK are polling 30%.Allowing for margins of error and another two weeks of campaigning, the seat will be hotly contested between all three parties on 4 July.Jacob Rees-MoggJacob Rees-Mogg is on track to lose his seat at the general election. (PA)While no longer a government minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg losing his North East Somerset and Hanham seat would perhaps be one of the night’s bigger surprises. Rees-Mogg has been an outspoken critic of some of Sunak’s policies and is a regular presenter on GB News.However, the Ipsos poll has the seat, which has been newly-created for the 2024 election, is currently showing a “likely Labour” win, with the party on 47%, compared to 30% for the Conservatives.Johnny MercerPolling suggests Johnny Mercer will lose his seat to Labour at the election. (PA)Veterans’ affairs secretary Johnny Mercer is standing for the Plymouth Moor View seat, having last won the seat in 2019 with an increased vote share of 60.7%. However, a “likely” Labour win is expected, with a projected vote share of 49% on 4 July. The Tories are currently polling at 30% – half of what they won in 2019.Victoria PrentisAttorney general Victoria Prentis is currently facing being replaced by Labour in the election. (PA)A “likely” Labour victory is predicted for Banbury, a seat currently held by attorney general Victoria Prentis. The Tories are polling at 30% in the constituency, compared to 40% for Labour. Prentis is notable for being the first British MP to take a Ukrainian refugee in her house following Russia’s invasion.Alex ChalkThe Libreal Democrats are projected to take over justice secretary Alex Chalk’s seat. (Alamy)Justice secretary Alex Chalk won 48% of the vote in the Cheltenham constituency in the 2019 election. However, the seat is now leaning to being “strong Liberal Democrat”, with Sir Ed Davey’s party polling 60% of the vote. Chalk and the Conservatives are projected to win 26% of the vote, according to Ipsos.David TC DaviesDavid TC Davies is projected to lose his seat in the general election. (PA)Welsh secretary David TC Davies is facing a “likely” Labour victory on 4 July, with the party projected to win 45% of the vote, compared to 30% for the Tories.

310,"The Labour leader has made 'no tax rises for working people' a key commitment in the party's manifesto - Stefan Rousseau/PASir Keir Starmer has fuelled fears that Labour could be planning a tax raid on savings and pensions.The Labour leader has made “no tax rises for working people” a key commitment in the party’s manifesto.But in a radio interview yesterday, Sir Keir appeared to define “working people” as those with insubstantial savings.“People who earn their living rely on our [public] services and don’t really have the ability to write a cheque when they get into trouble,” he told LBC.“So the sort of people I’m meeting pretty well every day now. It’s quite a big group because these days there are many people obviously not so well off.”ADVERTISEMENTSenior Tories have leapt upon the remarks, with Jeremy Hunt saying Labour had “let slip [its] true plans to raise taxes across the board”.Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves seemed to distance herself from Sir Keir’s comments when asked about them on Wednesday.She told the Today programme: “Working people are people who get their income from going out to work every day, and also pensioners that have worked all their lives and are now in retirement, drawing down on their pensions.”Here, Telegraph Money outlines some of the ways Labour could increase the tax take from savers and pensioners if it gets into power.Scrap or slash the £20,000 Isa allowanceSavers can currently stash £20,000 a year into Individual Savings Accounts and pay no tax on the returns.Isas are expected to save people a total of £6.7bn in 2023-24. This is up from £4.9bn in 2022-23, as higher interest rates have made the tax relief more expensive.The growing cost of Isas could make them an obvious target for Ms Reeves if Labour gets into power.The Resolution Foundation has previously said that Isas are costly for the Government and “overwhelmingly benefit the better off”. It has therefore called for a lifetime cap on the amount that can be saved into an Isa, at £100,000.But a new government could also decide to lower or scrap the annual allowance entirely. The £20,000 exemption is more than half the annual salary of an average worker (earning £35,000) and, in 2020-21, only 7pc of Isa holders maxed out their annual allowance.Story continuesSo it is possible Labour could decide to replace the system with something else. The Resolution Foundation said expanding auto-enrolment could boost low levels of household saving.The think tank’s chief executive Torsten Bell took leave from his role earlier this month to run for Labour MP in Swansea West in Wales.Cut the personal savings allowanceLabour could raid people’s savings by cutting or reducing the personal savings allowance.A growing number of people have been forced to pay tax on their savings for the first time because of frozen thresholds.Basic rate taxpayers must pay tax once they earn more than £1,000 in savings income, dropping to £500 for higher-rate taxpayers.Neither of these bands have changed since the allowance was introduced in 2016 – despite savings rates having soared over the last few years.Sarah Coles, of stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “It’s worth bearing in mind that for those with substantial savings, both Labour and the Conservatives have a tax sting in the works.“Once you earn interest beyond the allowance outside an Isa, you will pay income tax. Both parties have refused to address frozen income tax thresholds, which means more people risk moving into a higher tax bracket, where they lose at least some of their allowance, and pay tax on their savings at a higher rate too.”Cut tax relief for pensionersSavers get tax relief on their pension contributions at their marginal rate of tax (20pc, 40pc or 45pc).Helen Morrissey, of investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, said tinkering with pension tax relief is one option Labour could consider.“Previous comments from Rachel Reeves have been unearthed where she backed a flat rate of around 33pc of tax relief - this would be a boost to the pensions of basic rate taxpayers but a cut for those on higher and additional rates.“These comments date back several years and Labour has said it is not current policy but it could prove a tempting option to opt for a flat rate that could be pegged at around 33pc, or possibly even lower.”Labour could also slash the annual allowance – the amount someone can save into their pension each year before having to pay tax. This stands at £60,000.Reduce the tax-free lump sumOne way for Labour to raise further tax on pensions would be to reduce the amount people can withdraw from their pots tax-free.Once you reach the age of 55, you can take 25pc of the amount as a tax-free lump sum. The maximum amount is £268,275.Simon Allister, of LGT Wealth Management, said: “It must be said that pensions are, at present, very tax efficient indeed for wealthy individuals. There is a conversation to be had about how sustainable that is.“We have many clients who were net beneficiaries of the abolition of the lifetime allowance. There was always a question mark as to whether Labour would reintroduce the previous legislation. This ‘will they, won’t they?’ was a big point of curiosity for our clients. Our general view was that the Lifetime Allowance ‘ship had likely sailed’, however, we do predict that pensions are an area they will look to tighten.”Remove inheritance tax allowance on pensionsPension pots are not currently included in the value of an estate for inheritance tax purposes.This has led to more and more people loading up their pensions with the aim of bequeathing these to their children and grandchildren.The Institute for Fiscal Studies, a think tank, has said this is an “eccentric” part of the tax system that needs to be addressed. It has urged the Government to scrap the tax break, estimating this would raise £1.9bn a year in revenue.Labour has said that it has no plans to remove inheritance tax relief for pensions. But it may feel tempted to follow the recommendations of the IFS as it looks to raise revenue.Nicholas Nesbitt, of tax advisory firm Forvis Mazars, said: “Perhaps the most anomalous area of pension taxation is the treatment of pension funds on death – they can broadly pass on free of tax.“It seems entirely possible that a future government would look to tax pension assets on death.”Equalise capital gains and income taxThere has been plenty of debate around Labour’s plans for capital gains tax, which was conspicuously absent from the party’s manifesto.Capital gains tax is due on profits worth over £3,000 when people sell investments or second homes.The rates are charged at 10pc to 28pc. Some have argued this creates a disparity where workers’ salaries are taxed more heavily than “unearned income”.Ms Reeves voiced her support for raising capital gains tax rates in a 2018 pamphlet called The Everyday Economy. However, she published this six years ago, before becoming Shadow Chancellor.Bringing the rates in line with income tax would see investors paying higher charges when selling investments or second homes.Williams Steven, of advice firm Killik & Co, said: “Now is as important as ever to make sure you are utilising any tax allowances you have available – particularly, saving into Isas and pensions – to ensure you are not subject to unnecessary capital gains tax.”Labour was contacted for comment.",All the ways Keir Starmer could hammer ‘non-working’ people,9,11
303,"The European Commission has issued a reprimand to France for breaking EU fiscal rules before an election where the frontrunners are making lavish spending promises.The EU executive’s decision to launch the “excessive deficit procedure” against France is a blow to Emmanuel Macron – with a deficit well above the EU threshold – and also sets up a collision course with a post-election government potentially dominated by the far-right or the left coalition.Both groups have made large spending pledges ahead of legislative elections on 30 June and 7 July and, according to polls, are leaving Macron’s Renaissance party trailing in third place.The far-right National Rally has pledged to repeal Macron’s hard-fought pension reform and reduce the retirement age for those who began work in their teens. Marine Le Pen’s party also wants to reduce VAT on food and fuel, and in the 2022 presidential campaign promised to exempt workers under 30 from income tax.The New Popular Front, which unites the left, wants to reduce the retirement age to 60, raise the minimum wage and freeze the prices of food, energy and fuel.The current finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, warned that “a Liz Truss scenario was possible”, if National Rally implemented its economic programme, referring to how the short-lived British prime minister spooked financial markets with plans for big unfunded tax cuts. He has made similar warnings about the spending plans of the left.France’s deficit – the difference between government spending and revenues – was 5.5% of economic output in 2023 and is forecast to remain at 5% in 2025, well above the EU threshold of 3%. Government debt was 110.6% of gross domestic product in 2023 and is forecast to increase to 113.8% by 2025, compared with the EU limit of 60% of GDP. “The debt sustainability analysis indicates high risk over the medium term,” the commission said.Six other member states in breach of EU deficit rules were put into the same procedure on Wednesday: Belgium, Italy, Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovakia.Under new rules agreed last year, rule-breaking countries must reduce “excessive” deficits by 0.5% a year. But in an attempt to avoid hurting economic growth, the rules allow more flexibility for spending on defence, green and digital policies.In theory, repeat rule breakers could be fined, but no country has ever faced this sanction, amid fears it could worsen the economic situation and fuel political tensions.EU officials will not set out explicit recommendations to rule-breaking countries on how to reduce the deficit until after a new commission takes office on 1 November. These deficit-reduction plans would also have to be endorsed by EU finance ministers.The EU economy commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, declined to comment on the French parties’ spending plans, merely saying that he was confident that discussions with a future French government would be “useful and with a good conclusion”.Gentiloni, a former Italian prime minister, rejected suggestions that the obligation to reduce deficits signalled a return to austerity: “Our economic and fiscal policies are now entering a new cycle. This does not mean back to normal, because we are not living in normal times; and definitely not back to austerity, because this would be a terrible mistake.”",European Commission warns France over fiscal rules as election looms,9,8
193,"Rishi Sunak has endured a brutal hour-long radio phone in which he was accused of “lying through his teeth” and dubbed a “pound-shop Nigel Farage” over his record on LGBT rights.The prime minister faced a grilling from callers furious at the Conservatives’ 14-year record on the state of the NHS and housing - as well as the party’s decision to accept millions from controversial donor Frank Hester.In a sign of the electoral challenge facing Mr Sunak, he was given a markedly frostier reception than Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who faced LBC listeners 24 hours earlier.Rishi Sunak was accused of ‘lying through his teeth’ in the phone-in (LBC)In one of the most brutal moments of the show, a gay man accused Mr Sunak of being “obsessed with divisive culture wars” and called him a “pound-shop Nigel Farage”.The man, who has lived with HIV for more than 16 years, said the PM has “behaved disgracefully” toward the trans community and during the visit of murdered teenager Brianna Ghey’s mother to parliament.Click here for our live coverage of the general election campaign.“So is it fair to say that you are anti-LGBT rights… and that you are obsessed with divisive culture wars?” Mr Sunak was asked.In what became a common refrain for the prime minister, he told the caller he was “sorry to hear that you feel that way” adding: “I care very much about making sure that people, whatever their backgrounds, are respected and treated with compassion and sensitivity.”He was then confronted by a caller named Ellen, who said that “as a young person in this country, everything about my future feels more uncertain”.Ellen said housing is unaffordable, tuition fees have soared and public services including the NHS are crumbling.Mr Sunak failed to address the points directly, but said if re-elected he would make it easier for young people to buy their own homes.He also said the Conservatives have improved the quality of rental accommodation and put new safeguards in place for renters.In another cutting moment for Mr Sunak, Ellen said: “Frankly, I think you’re lying through your teeth. You have had a decade and a half to improve housing, rental conditions and any of the issues I talked about and young people just don’t believe your promises anymore.”Mr Sunak again told the caller he was “sorry you feel like that”.In the Labour leader’s LBC phone-in, he was challenged by callers over Labour’s plans to introduce VAT on private school fees, his past support for Jeremy Corbyn and potential tax hikes under a Labour government.But he faced a notably less hostile audience, while Mr Sunak struggled for respite.The brightest spot of the PM’s interview was when he was asked about inflation returning to the Bank of England’s 2 per cent target, a rare boost for the PM during the general election.Mr Sunak acknowledged it has been a tough few years, but said the easing of price increases would be “very good news” for households. “But the headaches kept piling up for Mr Sunak, who was confronted by Figen Murray, the mother of Manchester Arena bombing victim Martyn Hett, over why he has not passed a law in her son’s honour yet.Figen Murray, mother of Manchester Arena bombing victim Martyn Hett, arriving in Downing Street (Stefan Rousseau/PA) (PA Wire)The prime minister was asked why it is referred to as a “priority” in the Conservative Party manifesto despite him promising Ms Murray 18 months ago that he would pass it.She said: “You have put in your manifesto that Martyn’s law is a priority. I don’t know what you mean by that because you promised me 18 months ago, in a phone call on what would have been Martyn’s 35th birthday, that you’re going to really hurry up with Martyn’s law and you’re very committed to it. And there has been nothing since then.”The PM said he is still planning to pass the law before summer recess if he is re-elected, despite only having a week of time scheduled between the reopening of parliament after the election and MPs going on their holidays.He was also attacked by a caller over the party’s decision to keep millions of pounds donated by Frank Hester, who said Labour veteran Diane Abbott “makes you want to hate all black women” and “should be shot”.He has given £15m to the Conservatives, and Mr Sunak said the businessman has apologised and should be allowed to move on from the comments he made in 2019.Mr Sunak even compared Mr Hester to Ms Abbott, who was suspended from the Labour Party last April for a letter the MP wrote suggesting Jewish people are not subjected to the same racism as some other minorities.The PM told LBC: “Diane Abbott has been readmitted into the Labour Party, and she herself had made some comments in the past that weren’t appropriate, but she apologised for those and was readmitted back into the Labour Party after having the whip withdrawn.”The interview ended on a positive, if embarrassing, note for the prime minister when he was asked to wish his predecessor Boris Johnson a happy birthday.Mr Johnson has so far not returned from his summer holidays to hit the campaign trail for the Conservatives, and is not expected to do more than sign off on some letters and record videos backing Tory candidates.But Mr Sunak said: ““I hope he is having a good day”.“It’s been great having him supporting the Conservative Party, he has been endorsing lots of candidates with videos and letters and that is really great and makes a big difference,” Mr Sunak added.",Rishi Sunak dubbed ‘pound shop Farage’ during hour-long LBC mauling,9,9
316,"The SNP will have a mandate for another independence referendum even if it suffers an election wipeout, John Swinney has insisted as he unveiled his party’s manifesto.The prospectus said Mr Swinney would have the democratic right to open “immediate negotiations” with the UK Government for another referendum if the party wins a majority of Scotland’s 57 seats.Speaking at the launch event in Edinburgh, the First Minister said the SNP achieving this benchmark of 29 seats would “intensify the pressure to secure Scottish independence.”But he repeatedly refused to accept that Scots would have voted to remain in the UK if his party failed to achieve its target, and a majority of seats was won by the Unionist parties.Mr Swinney insisted that the SNP would still retain a separate mandate for independence from the 2021 Holyrood election, despite it falling short of gaining a majority in that contest.He also said there would be no guarantee that an independent Scotland would succeed.‘Success would not be guaranteed’“Of course, an independent Scotland, like all countries, would face challenges. Success would not be guaranteed,” he said.“That would be determined by our own decisions as a country and the choices we make. But when we look at independent European countries similar to Scotland there are grounds for optimism and hope.”Mr Swinney’s refusal to accept that Scots would have voted to remain in the UK if his party failed to achieve its target followed a series of polls showing the SNP is on course to lose well over half of the 48 seats it won in the 2019 general election, with Labour again having the largest number of Scottish MPs.Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, accused the SNP of focusing on “constitutional wrangling” rather than “what people care about day to day”. Both he and Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, have rejected authorising a second independence referendum.The SNP manifesto launch was a much smaller event than in previous elections, with the party struggling to raise funds while it is under the shadow of a police investigation into its finances.Peter Murrell, the party’s former chief executive and Nicola Sturgeon’s husband, has been charged with embezzlement. The manifesto itself was also much shorter at only 28 pages, about 20 fewer than in 2019.The first page contained the words in block capitals: “Vote SNP for Scotland to become an independent country.” It later claimed that leaving the UK was necessary to address the cost of living crisis and reduce poverty.The document argued Scots should vote SNP as “it is more important than ever for the mandate won in 2021 to be respected. At this election, we are asking you to vote for an independent Scotland.“If the SNP wins a majority of Scottish seats, the Scottish Government will be empowered to begin immediate negotiations with the UK Government to give democratic effect to Scotland becoming an independent country.”Mr Swinney clarified that his preferred way of doing this was a rerun of the 2014 referendum, with Westminster handing Holyrood the powers to stage another vote.The manifesto argued that the powers should be permanently transferred, allowing the SNP to stage repeated referendums until it won one, a scenario previously described by Unionists as a “neverendum”.Unveiling the manifesto in Edinburgh with a speech that mentioned independence 14 times, the First Minister said: “We must never lose faith in the power of the democratic voice of the people of Scotland.“In 2021 they voted for a Scottish Parliament with a clear majority for independence and for a referendum. That democratic choice must be respected. At this election we have the opportunity to reinforce the case for Scotland becoming an independent country.”However, he was challenged four times whether he would accept that independence had been rejected by the electorate if the SNP fails to win a majority of seats.‘Manifesto can be summed up in one word’The First Minister argued that him answering the question would be akin to “predicting the outcome of the election” and repeatedly referred to the 2021 result, in which the SNP won 40.3 per cent of the regional vote share.Craig Hoy, the Scottish Tory chairman, said: “The SNP’s entire manifesto can be summed up in one word – independence. The first page is dedicated solely to splitting up Scotland from the rest of the United Kingdom.“None of Scotland’s urgent priorities will get any focus from the SNP. For John Swinney, independence comes before the economy, the NHS and everything else.”The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the manifesto called for UK-wide spending to be “topped up”, with the cost met by tax rises, more borrowing and higher economic growth from the UK rejoining the EU.David Phillips, the economic think tank’s associate director, said: “However, in its call for Scottish independence, the SNP ignores the potential hit to economic growth from leaving the UK, and the big fiscal challenges an independent Scotland would immediately have to confront.”NHSThe SNP has demanded that the UK Government pumps an extra £10 billion annually into the NHS. It claims this would “address rampant inflationary pressures and improve performance”.In addition, it wants the UK Government to match the more generous pay deals the devolved government has agreed with NHS workers to prevent strikes, but is now causing it financial difficulties.This would cost a further £6 billion across the UK, which would result in a total boost to the Scottish Government’s budget of £1.6 billion.The party is also saying it would introduce a “Keep the NHS in Public Hands” Bill, which it says would protect the health service.EUThe SNP wants to “reverse the damage of Brexit and re-enter the single market restoring free movement for EU citizens.”However, it appears to concede that the UK will not be rejoining the EU, instead emphasising a “vision for an independent Scotland in the EU”.The manifesto states that Brexit has been a disaster for Scotland and wiped billions from the Scottish economy.However, there is no detail about how, even if Scotland was to achieve independence, it would meet membership requirements.DefenceThe SNP’s flagship defence policy is to scrap the Trident nuclear deterrent.It says the money saved from retiring Britain’s nuclear submarines could instead be spent on “conventional defence and public services”.","SNP would have mandate for independence even after an election wipeout, says Swinney",9,11
183,"Rishi Sunak during a visit to Sizewell in Suffolk earlier today. James Manning - PA Images via Getty ImagesThe Tories are heading for their worst election result in more than 100 years, according to a major new poll.In a further shattering blow for Rishi Sunak, the More In Common survey of more than 10,000 voters shows the party is on course to be left with just 155 MPs after July 4.Labour, meanwhile, are set to gain more than 200 seats to leave them with 406 and a majority of 162.More in Common also say there are 96 marginal seats where the Conservatives are currently within five points of victory.That means they could potentially end up with as many as 203 MPs - or as few as 107 - depending on how they perform on election day.The so-called MRP poll - which surveys more people than normal and gives a seat-by-seat prediction to try to come up with a more accurate forecast - puts the Lib Dems on 49 seats, the SNP on 18, Plaid Cymru on 2 and the Greens on 1.One small glimmer of hope for the Tories is that the poll is not as negative for them as last night’s Ipsos UK one, which forecast a 256-seat Labour majority.Luke Tryl, executive director of More in Common UK, said: “The fact that this projection showing the Conservatives barely holding 150 seats is one of the most favourable to the Conservatives shows how deep a hole the party finds itself in - with barely two weeks to go for them to change the dial.“Far from the narrowing in the polls many expected to see by now, the Conservatives’ position instead appears to be getting worse and only a small move away from them could see them reduced to 107 seats.“Labour on the other hand looks set to inherit a historic majority while remaining largely undefined in the eyes of the electorate.“While creating such a broad electoral coalition, that will span from Blue Wall Worthing to Blyth in the Red Wall, is a good problem to have in the short term, it points to potential difficulties in creating a governing agenda that unites such disparate tribes - especially when electoral cynicism is so high.”Related...A Tory Cabinet Minister Has Admitted Labour Are Heading For 'A Large Majority'Billionaire Tory Donor Backs Labour In Latest Blow For Rishi SunakLabour On Course For 256-Seat Majority As Tory Nightmare Comes True","Tories Set For Worst Election Result In More Than 100 Years, New Poll Reveals",9,3
134,"Nearly 3 million people have applied to register to vote since the general election was called on 22 May — down by a quarter from the same period before the 2019 general election.In 2019, the general election was called on 29 October and the deadline to register was 26 November. In that period 3.85m people applied to register in this period cmpared to 2.90m this time.Over 630,000 people applied to register to vote yesterday alone (18 June), as the deadline approached at midnight. This is the second-highest number on record, broken only on the 26 November 2019, when 660,000 people registered in one day.The latest figure of people on the parliamentary electoral register in the UK is 46,652,520, but it has not been updated since December 2023.Gen-Z not showing up?There has been much discussion over young voters not being democratically involved — with an exclusive Independent poll showing that a third of young people do not plan to vote.In fact, registration application among the youngest group of voters (18-25) is at just half of the 2019 equivalent period; with just 746,000 Gen-Z voters registering to vote since the election was called this year, compared to 1.4 million in the lead-up to the 2019 general election.It is also worth noting that a large chunk of the current under-25s group were not of voting age at the last general election. Therefore, a substantial portion of Gen-Z voters will not be registered to vote in this election, compared to other age groups.Nonetheless, people aged 35 and under were flocking to register to vote at the final hour, more than any other age group. Over half (55 per cent) of all registrations yesterday were in the 18-34 age group, and 164,000 of these were people aged 25 and under.People aged 25-34 have been the most keen to register overall, with 896,825 registrations since 22 May alone.Though the registration deadline has passed, applications for postal vote are still open until today (19 June) at 5pm.Voters in the July 4 general election will also need a valid form of photo ID, including a passport, driving licence, or blue badge.",Voter registrations leading up to election were down by 25% compared to 2019 poll,9,9

Email amy-clare.martin@independent.co.ukThe actress told The Independent: “I’m alarmed by the lack of attention given to the rising tide of knife crime during this election campaign. Since my brother Ben’s tragic murder in 2008, over 1,000 teenagers have lost their lives, and the numbers keep climbing – an 81 per cent increase in knife crime in the last decade.“All evidence suggests this will worsen. Our trust’s recent survey revealed a worrying trend: one in four young people believe carrying a knife offers protection.“Loopholes in legislation and lax online age verification make it shockingly easy to acquire dangerous knives. Unsanctioned violent content on social media further exposes young minds to knife crime. The age of knife carriers is dropping too.“With a heavy heart, I fear more families will suffer our loss unless this issue is tackled urgently. Knife crime is a silent epidemic, and it’s time for political leaders to break the silence during this campaign.”Her intervention comes after a string of horrifying recent attacks, including the killing of 14-year-old schoolboy Daniel Anjorin in a sword rampage in April as he walked to school in Hainault, east London, and the stabbing of schoolgirl Elianne Andam, 15, at a bus stop in Croydon last year.James Bascoe-Smith was left with life-changing brain injuries after he miraculously survived an unprovoked knife attack in Brixton (PA)Patrick Green, CEO of the charity Ms Kinsella co-founded in her brother’s name, the Ben Kinsella Trust, said the shocking case this week of two 12-year-olds becoming Britain’s youngest killers since the murder of James Bulger highlights the urgent crisis.One of the knife-obsessed pair, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had posed on social media with a 17-inch long machete hours before they used it to murder 19-year-old Shawn Seesahai in a Wolverhampton Park.“This case really highlights everything that’s wrong – two 12-year-olds with a machete,” he added. “How does that happen? Surely that says an awful lot about where we are.“There’s a litany of failures in relation to knife crime and it’s frustrating for me that it’s not part of the debate and the focus is not on the safety of children.“Knife crime hasn’t been dominant in terms of the election debate so far.

With crime it is almost as if we have become immune to it and we have run out of ideas.”He said the recent case involving two 12-year-old killers “beggars belief”.Figures show offences involving a knife or sharp instrument increased by seven per cent last year – with 49,489 recorded by police between January and December 2023.This was up from 46,153 in 2022, but three per cent lower than pre-Covid pandemic levels.Rishi Sunak has promised to recruit 8,000 extra police officers.In Labour’s manifesto, published on Thursday, Sir Keir Starmer vowed to halve knife crime in a decade.

70,"I have a strange confession to make. I can’t stop dreaming about Keir Starmer. Over the past few months, and particularly since next month’s general election was called, the Labour leader has appeared in my nocturnal imaginings on a semi-regular basis – as much as any real person I know. He stalks my psyche like Freddy Krueger, if Krueger was less interested in slicing up teens and more concerned with winning the approval of “Stevenage Woman”. It turns out I’m not the only one – after I mentioned this phenomenon at work, a colleague confessed to having Starmer dreams as well. You too may have spent the last few weeks dreaming of Starmer, or Ed Davey, or even Nigel Farage. Whatever the case, this is a safe and judgement-free space.My Starmer dreams aren’t violent. And no, before you ask, they’re not raunchy either. In fact, as dreams go, they’re pretty banal. In them, Starmer doesn’t really do anything of note, doesn’t utter so much as a “my father was a toolmaker”. The dreams take the form of some prosaic scenario – I’ll be at a house party with friends, for instance – and then he will simply be there, and I will spend the duration of the dream yelling at him, berating him, working myself into a veritable imaginative lather. (It may be worth pointing out here that I am actually not Starmer’s biggest fan.) They say you should never go to bed angry. But what if you keep waking up furious?It could be worse, of course: better to be dream-stalked by the visage of Starmer than, say, Adolf Hitler, or Genghis Khan. If nothing else, there’s also a sort of distinctly British modesty to it, as if my dreams were being organised by some cloutless, third-rate talent booker. (“Count Dracula is a no… would you take John Prescott?”)But what exactly is causing this personal Nightmare on Downing Street? I suspect it is a matter of political impotence. Maybe I’m subconsciously channelling my frustration around how voiceless I – and many others who are pro-immigration, pro-LGBT+ rights and anti-privatisation – currently feel when it comes to the Labour Party. If I can’t yell at the real Keir Starmer, this mental facsimile will have to do. Perhaps it’s something more abstract: Sigmund Freud might have suggested that this imaginary Starmer-shaped punching bag is in fact a stand-in for my father, or my mother, or has something to do with penises. But Freud, as we all know, was coked out of his gourd and it’s probably best to ignore him. (Besides, my dad would never be caught dead in the Arsenal home crowd.)Ultimately, the hows and whys don’t matter so much. The crux of the issue is I want these dreams to stop. I need Starmer cut from the cast of my nighttime fantasies, written out abruptly like David Caruso in the second season of NYPD Blue. So I asked chartered psychologist Dr Mark Rackley to shed some light on my dreams, in the hope that I could, in the words of Labour’s manifesto, “change”.“Dreams remain one of the great mysteries within psychological science,” he tells me. “And there is no common consensus as to why we dream or what purpose they serve.” As everyone likely knows first hand already, dreams, he says, can be “illogical”, have a “first-person perspective” and can “contain elements of waking life”. So far, so clear. But where does Starmer enter into this?“In the run-up to the general election, this can create anticipatory anxiety around what will happen and provoke strong negative emotional responses such as anger, fear, frustration and hopelessness,” Dr Rackley continues. “We can fear that the election will bring negative change to our lives and that we are powerless to stop this change from happening. This actual reality can then get played out in the dreams that we have and can produce some strange experiences in our dreams.”The man in my dreams: Keir Starmer, pictured in corporeal form on 5 June 2024 (Getty Images)Politicians like Starmer and Rishi Sunak are, he continues, “characters in our life”, even if we do not know them personally. “As dreams are involuntary experiences that are created by our unconscious mind, we can have dreams about politicians, talking to them and arguing with them and this can feel real, as when we dream, the feelings that are produced stay with us,” he adds. “This type of dream relates to our reality and is triggered by events that are familiar to us.”With all that said, is there any chance of stopping the dream? Of ridding my mind of Starmer via some kind of oneiric deep clean? It turns out it’s not that easy. “As dreams are involuntary experiences, we cannot predict or control them,” says Dr Rackley. “You cannot force the brain to produce or stop a dream; that is out of everyone’s control. The best we can do is seek to understand the process and not let the dream wreck our head too much!”It may not be what I wanted to hear, but hey – perhaps it’s not the end of the world. If I were plagued by dreams of Sunak, I’m not sure I’d ever sleep again.",I can’t stop dreaming about Keir Starmer – help!,9,9

353,"Three polls released in the space of an hour have indicated that Rishi Sunak is on course for a crushing defeat in the upcoming general election - with one report suggesting he could become the first sitting prime minister to lose his seat.The polls published on Wednesday evening were commissioned by the Telegraph, Sky and the News Agents podcast. All the polls use the multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP) technique, which enables projections to be made at constituency level.And while all three polls indicate Sunak faces an uphill battle to avoid a major defeat, there is a significant disparity from all three as to how far ahead Keir Starmer actually is.Yahoo summaries the key points of the three pollsTories to slump to lowest number of seats since party's formationYouGov's polling for Sky News projects Labour is on course to achieve a 200-seat majority. Labour is predicted to secure 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.This projection would show the Tories plummeting from the 365 won by Boris Johnson in the 2019 election and give the party their lowest ever number of MPs. It would also give Starmer more seats than the 418 won by Tony Blair in 1997. Read a full report of this poll from Sky NewsThe YouGov poll for Sky News.Conservatives on course for worst defeat in over a centuryAccording to polling by More In Common UK for the News Agents podcast, Labour is projected to finish on 406 seats, a majority of 162.

This polling puts Labour on a massive 516 seats, with the Tories on only 53 - just in front of the Lib Dems on 50 - a forecast that would be remarkable were it to be reflected on polling night.

Given the nature of these seat totals, it is natural to be slightly sceptical.""It adds: ""Not every MRP is the same. The statistical 'building blocks' used to model voter behaviour will vary from pollster to pollster, which will in turn lead to different vote shares and seat totals. All different pollsters will get different national vote share.""The MRP methodology, as described by YouGov, ""uses data at the constituency level to predict the outcomes of seats based on the concentration of various different types of voters who live there"".Stuart Wilks-Heeg, writing in The Conversation earlier this month, points out some of the other limitations of MRP polling: ""There are ... factors MRPs cannot take into account. Some constituency results will be influenced by locally specific issues that statistical models can’t capture. For example, adjustments cannot be made for who the candidates are in each constituency and whether any have a profile that could enhance, or detract from, their party’s chance of winning. Think Nigel Farage standing for Reform UK in Clacton.""And competing MRPs produce contrasting outcomes because each model uses specific assumptions and data. Different inputs produce different outputs. This election has seen more MRPs produced than ever before, and from various organisations. In the early hours of July 5, we’ll know which one came closest to getting the result correct.""What are the latest odds?As of 19 June, Oddschecker – a website which compares odds across different bookmakers – had Labour at 1/41 to win the most seats.

(YouGov)So, why have the polls changed so dramatically? It's worth looking back on an extremely eventful four-and-a-half years in UK politics.According to YouGov's voting intention tracker (see chart, above), Tory support peaked at 53%, with Labour on 32%, in April 2020, months after the party's stunning success in the 2019 general election and Boris Johnson's pledge to “get Brexit done”. That month also saw Starmer take over as Labour leader from Jeremy Corbyn.This was also amid a spirit of national unity following the onset of the COVID pandemic which nearly killed Johnson himself. The then-PM had been released from hospital five days before this particular survey was taken.Boris Johnson delivers his final speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street in September 2022. (AFP via Getty Images)Over the rest of the year, there was a downturn in support amid chaos over COVID rules, with the Tories falling as low as 35% in November 2020, compared to Labour on 40%.However, the UK’s successful COVID vaccination programme provided a pathway out of lockdown and with it, improved poll ratings. Tory support peaked at 41% in June 2021, with Labour at 30%.In October that year, there was a sense Johnson was untouchable. At the Tory party conference, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg remarked how the PM was ""in total command of his party, and politically dominant in the country"".But this fell apart quickly with the Partygate scandal, which emerged in November that year. Time and again, reports emerged of government and Tory staff – including Johnson – having taken part in lockdown-era social gatherings when their own COVID rules had prohibited them.By January 2022, Tory support had plummeted to 28%, with Labour on 38%. Johnson struggled on, but never recovered and a wave of ministerial resignations forced him to resign in July that year.The UK had three separate prime ministers – Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak – between 6 September and 24 October, 2022. (Getty Images)His successor, Liz Truss, then embarked on arguably the most disastrous prime ministerial reign in history, characterised by the catastrophic ""mini-budget"", containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, which prompted an economic crisis. Like Johnson, she lost the confidence of Tory MPs – and voters – and had to resign.Her 49-day spell as PM was the shortest in history, with Tory support plummeting to 19% (with Labour on 56%) the day after she announced her resignation in October 2022.Rishi Sunak, who had lost to Truss in the previous month's Tory leadership election, took over. However, as the above YouGov chart indicates, he has failed to cut through with voters. Tory support was at 23% two days after he assumed office, with the most recent survey, carried out on Thursday, showing support is now lower than under Truss at 18%.In short, the polls and odds, not to mention other factors such as notable by-election victories for Starmer's Labour, are pointing to a Labour government next month.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

The successful candidate’s most urgent job has a more familiar ring, however: to address the capital’s accelerating demographic crisis.The contest between incumbent Yuriko Koike and Renho Murata – who is commonly known by her given name – is being seen as a proxy war between the governing Liberal Democratic party [LDP], which is backing Koike, and the main opposition Constitutional Democratic party [CDP], which is supporting Renho.Related: ‘I decided I could do better than them’: the women taking on Japan’s male-dominated politicsKoike, a conservative who guided the city through the Covid-19 pandemic and the summer Olympics in 2021, is seeking a third term with promises to focus on family-friendly measures. The former defence and environment minister became Tokyo’s first female governor in 2016.Her main challenger is the centre-left Renho, a 56-year-old former swimsuit model who became the first female leader of Japan’s largest opposition party in 2016. She left the CDP to run as an independent, but has the support of her former party and, controversially, the Japanese Communist party [JCP].Koike, 71, was a TV news anchor before she entered politics, winning a seat in the lower house of parliament for the first time in 1993. Renho, too, was a familiar face on TV news programmes before she entered politics as a member of the upper house in 2004.Japan’s low birthrate has quickly emerged as the key issue in the 7 July vote, which will see almost 50 candidates from across the political spectrum competing to lead a megalopolis of 14.1 million people and a GDP that rivals that of the Netherlands.Nationwide, the fertility rate – or the average number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime – stands at 1.2, well below the 2.07 needed to keep the population stable. The situation in Tokyo is even more urgent: at 0.99, its birthrate is the lowest among Japan’s 47 prefectures.“Candidates must offer a blueprint for managing the unprecedented demographic challenges of an ageing and shrinking population in this megacity,” the Asahi Shimbun said in an editorial.The frontrunners have clashed over their plans to lift the birthrate, with Koike promising lower rents for families and free daycare for married couples’ first children.Renho said she would pressure companies to improve their employees’ work-life balance. “I want to make Tokyo a city where young people, regardless of their circumstances, can study, work, get married and have children, and have all these life choices” she said during a recent campaign speech, according to the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper.Both candidates have battled minor scandals. Koike has again been forced to deny allegations, first levelled at her four years ago, that she falsely claimed she had graduated from Cairo University in 1976 with a degree in sociology. The popularity of her backers, the LDP, has also been badly damaged by a funding scandal.Renho – who was born to a Japanese mother and Taiwanese father – sparked a minor controversy when she became opposition leader in 2016 by revealing she still held dual Japanese and Taiwanese nationality, despite insisting earlier that she had become a naturalised Japanese citizen in her teens.Japanese law requires people with dual nationality to choose one or the other before they turn 22. Renho later renounced her Taiwanese citizenship.",Tokyo election: demographic crisis the top issue as two women vie for job of governor,10,8
133,"NHS funding pledged by leading political parties “falls well short” of what is needed to make improvements in the service, a leading think tank has said.The Health Foundation called on politicians to be honest with the public about the scale of the crisis facing the NHS, and the amount of money needed to address issues.It said that an incoming government will face “difficult choices” – to increase taxes to provide more funding, reduce spending in other departments and services, or see the NHS “do less”.New analysis from the think tank concludes there is a potential £38 billion per year shortfall in the funding needed to improve the NHS by the end of the next parliament.Work by the Health Foundation’s REAL Centre suggests that funding in England will need to rise by an average of 3.8% per year in real terms over the next 10 years to meet rising demand and to deliver improvements across the service.This includes a higher level of growth of 4.5% per year in the first five years.Researchers projected what would happen if the health budget grows in line with the assumed growth in public spending factored into the Office for Budget Responsibility’s economic forecasts for the next parliament – real-terms funding increases of 0.8% per year.This level of growth would see the total Department of Health and Social Care budget increase to £197 billion in 2029/30 – leaving the healthcare system in England around £38 billion a year short of what is needed to drive improvements, experts said.A new Health Foundation report says the money is needed to bring “significant changes” to NHS services, and prioritises spending on GP care, mental health and community services.The analysis includes a 10-year timescale to tackle the backlog of routine hospital appointment – which is slower than Labour and the Conservatives have pledged.Anita Charlesworth, director of the Health Foundation’s REAL Centre, said: “The health service is in crisis and all the main political parties have said they want to fix it – yet the funding they have so far promised falls well short of the level needed to make improvements.“Politicians need to be honest with the public about the scale of the challenge the NHS faces and the reality that an NHS fit for the future needs long-term sustainable investment.In a #GeneralElection we often hear promises to employ more nurses.Jim Buchan explains that ‘more’ nurses at a national level also needs to translate into the ‘right’ number of nurses locally to provide safe care and increase productivity.Read more 👇https://t.co/KK2OJnj8xT pic.twitter.com/tdlwHvIilL— The Health Foundation (@HealthFdn) June 19, 2024“Honesty about this has so far been conspicuously lacking from the General Election debate, with both the main parties unwilling to spell out the difficult choices on public spending and taxation that will confront the next government.“The scenario we have set out is not overly ambitious – it is broadly in line with the pledges set out by the main political parties and public expectations, and assumes the NHS can deliver challenging improvements in productivity.”A Conservative Party spokesman said: “Thanks to our clear plan and bold action, we have virtually eliminated the longest NHS waits and overall waiting lists are falling at the fastest rate in over a decade outside the pandemic.“But there is more to do which is why our £3.4 billion Productivity Plan will transform the NHS with new technology and unlock £35 billion of cumulative savings by the end of the decade.“We will continue to increase NHS funding above inflation across the next Parliament to train and recruit 92,000 more nurses and 28,000 doctors through our Long Term Workforce Plan. We will deliver millions more scans, tests and checks as we cut waiting lists and deliver better care for patients.“Only Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives will take the bold action, backed by a clear plan, to build a brighter and healthier future.“Labour would take the country back to square one with at least £2,094 in higher council tax and other tax rises for every working family.”","NHS funding pledged by parties ‘well short’ of what is needed, says think tank",10,4

13,"A Tory candidate being investigated over an alleged bet on the date of the general election is married to the party’s director of campaigning.Laura Saunders, who is standing in Bristol North West, is the subject of an inquiry by the Gambling Commission, according to the BBC.It has now emerged she is married to Tony Lee, the Conservative Party’s Director of Campaigning.Ms Saunders, the second prospective parliamentary candidate being looked into by the gambling regulator, previously worked at Conservative Party headquarters in central London.Ms Saunders is the subject of an inquiry by the Gambling Commission, according to the BBCThe revelation follows the news that a police officer working in Rishi Sunak’s close protection team has been arrested as part of an investigation into bets placed on the date of the general election.The Metropolitan Police was contacted by the Gambling Commission last Friday and informed that the agency was looking into the activities of a member of Scotland Yard’s Royalty and Specialist Protection command.The police constable, who has not been named, was immediately removed from operational duties.Craig Williams, a senior aide to the Prime Minister, also reportedly bet £100 on the date of the election just before it was called.Mr Williams, who is standing for re-election as MP in Montgomeryshire, bet on the election being held in July three days before the announcement was made, according to The Guardian.The claim has not been disputed by Mr Williams, who admitted he had a “flutter” on the election a few weeks ago. He has since apologised for a “huge error of judgment”.Craig Williams, a senior aide to the Prime Minister, also reportedly bet £100 on the date of the election just before it was called - Matthew Horwood/Getty Images EuropeWith regards to Ms Saunders’ case, a Conservative Party spokesman said last night: “We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals.“As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn’t be proper to comment further, until any process is concluded.”Since the BBC reported on Thursday morning that Ms Saunders is married to Mr Lee, the latter’s LinkedIn page appears to have been taken down. A summary on Google shows he was listed as the party’s Director of Campaigning.The Tories’ Director of Campaigning is separate to their campaigns director, a post held by Isaac Levido, who is responsible for running the general election campaign.Mr Lee is understood to have a more minor role running local campaigns.Asked for comment, a Tory spokesman repeated their statement from Wednesday night.",Tory candidate who allegedly bet on election date ‘married to Conservative Director of Campaigns’,10,11

They faced 90 minutes of questioning from Julie Etchingham, the ITV newsreader who oversaw the first debate on June 4, and a live studio audience in Salford, Manchester.Both ITV and the BBC have hosted debates in an array of formats, giving candidates the opportunity to make a lasting impact on the latest opinion polls.When is the next general election TV debate? The BBC will return to host a Question Time special tonight, with leading members of the UK’s four largest parties: the Conservatives, Labour Party, SNP and Liberal Democrats.Fiona Bruce will lead the broadcast from 8pm to 10pm in York.

246,"Since May 2023, voters across the UK have been asked to show a form of photographic ID at their local ballot box.The requirement draws on the recommendations of a 2016 report by Lord Pickles, the former communities secretary, which warned there was a risk of “significant abuse” in the electoral system if people could vote under false pretences with little risk of detection.As Labour continues to hold a lead of around 20 percentage points in the latest election opinion polls, The Telegraph sets out everything you need to know about voting rules ahead of the general election on July 4.Here are the acceptable forms of identification you can bring to vote for an election candidate. Follow The Telegraph’s general election live coverageWhat are the voter ID requirements?Everyone wanting to vote in the UK must produce photo ID to take part in certain elections.For voters in England, Scotland and Wales, this includes UK parliamentary elections, by-elections and recall petitions. Those in England also need their ID for local elections.The requirement does not apply to Holyrood, Senedd or council elections in Scotland and Wales. People in Northern Ireland already needed photo ID to vote, so the rule change does not affect them.Voters in both England and Wales also need ID for police and crime commissioner elections.The rule has been applied in stages, beginning with the local elections in England on May 4, 2023. This year’s general election will be the first time ID is required for a national poll.The change marks a significant departure from the previous system in most of the UK, where voters only had to verbally confirm their name and address.What types of ID are accepted?Voters are required to show one form of photo ID at the polls, and it does not need to be in date so long as it is recognisable as the person at the ballot box.However, it must be the original version – not a photocopy – and the name on the ID should be the same as it appears on the electoral register.Acceptable forms of voter ID include:Passport issued by the UK, any of the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, a British Overseas Territory, an EEA state or a Commonwealth country (including an Irish Passport Card)Full or provisional driving licence issued by the UK, any of the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, or an EEA stateA Blue BadgeAny identity card bearing the Pass (Proof of Age Standards Scheme) hologramAny of the following travel passes:Older person’s bus pass funded by the GovernmentDisabled person’s bus pass funded by the GovernmentOyster 60+ card funded by the GovernmentFreedom passScottish national entitlement card issued for the purpose of concessionary travel (including a 60+, disabled or under 22s bus pass)60 and over Welsh concessionary travel cardDisabled person’s Welsh concessionary travel cardSenior SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandRegistered blind SmartPass or blind person’s SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandWar disablement SmartPass issued in Northern Ireland60+ SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandHalf fare SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandAny of these government-issued documents:Biometric immigration documentMinistry of Defence Form 90 (Defence Identity Card)National identity card issued by an EEA stateElectoral identity card issued in Northern IrelandVoter authority certificateAnonymous elector’s documentDo the rules apply to postal votes?No. You do not need to have any form of photo ID to vote by post.However, you will be asked to provide your National Insurance (NI) number when you apply to verify your identity. If you are not able to do this, you will need to explain why.The deadline to apply for a postal vote was 5pm on Wednesday June 19 in England, Scotland and Wales, with Saturday June 15 the limit in Northern Ireland. You must also already have registered to vote.How can I get a voter ID card?You can apply for a free voter authority certificate (VAC) either online or by post. To complete an online application, you will need a recent, digital photo of yourself and your NI number.You can still apply if you don’t have an NI number but you will need to provide alternative documents as proof of identity, such as your birth certificate, a bank statement or utility bill.To apply by post, you will need to fill out and send a form to your local electoral registration office.You will need the address of where you are registered to vote, a recent photo of yourself and your NI number.Again, other supporting documents are accepted but using these may prolong the application process.The electoral registration office must receive your form by 5pm, six working days before the election you wish to vote in.There is a different form to complete if you want to apply by post and you are living abroad, a member of the Armed Forces, a civil servant or a British Council employee.What if I do not have a valid ID?Anyone without a form of ID that fits the requirements can apply for a VAC.This is not a substitute to registering for vote, which must be done in advance of any application.Why was voter ID introduced?The aim was to stamp out voter fraud by forcing people to prove their identity at the polls.In his Government-commissioned report, Lord Pickles warned that the authorities were in a “state of denial” and “turning a blind eye” to the problem of electoral fraud.Why is voter ID so controversial?The Government has said the change is necessary to curb the “inexcusable potential” for “stealing someone’s vote” by simply quoting their name and address at the ballot box.However, critics say actual claims of electoral fraud are very rare in the UK.In 2019, the last general election year, there were only 33 allegations of impersonation at the polling station out of more than 58 million votes cast, according to the Electoral Reform Society.Opponents of the rule have also warned it will make it more difficult for certain people to vote, including the disabled, transgender and non-binary people, and black and ethnic minority groups.",The photo ID you need to vote in UK elections,10,11
150,"On display inside Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg’s untidy office are three large portraits: Sir Winston Churchill, Boris Johnson and himself.They hang from cream-coloured wallpaper behind a cluttered wooden desk at the centre of the HQ for Sir Jacob’s uphill campaign to win the North East Somerset and Hanham constituency – his fifth straight term in the area.“Boris went up when he became leader... we always had the leader up,” says Sir Jacob, looking up at the pictures. “Then Covid came and we’ve hardly used the office since.”No Liz Truss, then. But what about Rishi Sunak, will he get his place next to Churchill?‘Um... well, we will eventually,” Sir Jacob says, with a wry smile. “We’ll see how much we need it after the election, when he’s returned comfortably as PM. Yes, absolutely.”It’s 17 days to polling day on 4 July and I’m in Keynsham, on the edge of Bristol, following Sir Jacob’s general election campaign.The HQ for Sir Jacob’s campaign is a hive of activity ahead of morning canvassing (The Independent)Hidden down an alleyway between Bargain Booze and a local solicitor’s firm, it’s a struggle at first to find the office (I initially mistake it for the former Keynsham and District Conservative Club, where early-morning drinkers are sipping their first pint) but I get there eventually.Boxes of delivery leaflets cover most of the carpeted floor while the chairs and the steep stairwell are filled with around eight friendly members sipping coffee and chatting before the day’s canvassing.“The national polls... you know, we don’t read those,” says Margaret Brewer, Sir Jacob’s upbeat agent, with the latest poll from Ipsos projecting the worst post-war result for the Tory party.Suddenly, Sir Jacob appears at the doorway wearing a dark grey double-breasted suit with a large blue rosette.We shake hands before he picks an issue up with his agent. The local BBC channel is planning an election debate, and he’s concerned the Green Party candidate has not been invited.A map showing the redrawn constituency is displayed in Jacob Rees-Mogg’s office (The Independent)“It doesn’t seem fair,” he says, showing genuine concern, before heading outside to discuss the plan for the day in private.Sir Jacob was elected MP for North East Somerset 14 years ago. It’s a constituency he’s comically described as circling the city of Bath – where Lib Dem Wera Hobhouse was previously MP – like dough around the jam in a doughnut.But his political rite of passage came in 1997 when he was parachuted into a virtually unwinnable seat for the Tory party in Central Fife. A quick search online reveals pictures of the smartly dressed 27-year-old knocking on working-class doors.“There was no Bentley, sadly,” Sir Jacob laughs, correcting subsequent media coverage as he fondly recalls the campaign. “I’d knock on people’s doors and say, ‘I’m Jacob Rees-Mogg, I’m the Conservative candidate, can I count on you for your support?’“More often than not, people would laugh ... they did think it was very funny that a Tory was asking for their vote.”Fast forward 27 years, and electoral campaigning for Sir Jacob remains “very similar” – although in Longwell Green, where we are heading for canvassing today, the reception is likely to be different.The pretty urban suburb on the edge of east Bristol has a strong Conservative following – five out of the six local councillors are Tories – which Sir Jacob wants to cement ahead of the general election.‘More often than not, people would laugh,’ says Sir Jacob, thinking back to his first election campaign in Central Fife (Getty/Colin McPherson)And unlike on the Central Fife campaign, there’s no family nanny, Veronica Crook, in tow while knocking on doors – although his mother, Lady Gillian Rees-Mogg, does show up in the afternoon to help in the office.It takes eight minutes to drive from Keynsham to Longwell Green, where it doesn’t take long to spot the lanky figure of Sir Jacob talking to a woman in a cul-de-sac, or his smart Jaguar XJL parked nearby.This is a leafy area with a modern housing estate of large semi-detached homes, many with pristine front gardens. With the sun out, many residents are busy mowing lawns and cutting hedges.The area, like the neighbouring wards of Bitton and Hanham, will join the old North Somerset constituency as part of boundary changes at the election.But polling isn’t looking good for Sir Jacob.Labour’s Dan Norris, mayor of the West of England and former MP for the seat, is projected to win comfortably, with 42 per cent of the vote according to Survation’s MRP, followed by Sir Jacob on 27 per cent, Lib Dems on 14 per cent and Reform UK with 12 per cent.Mr Norris’s election leaflet features a “Stop Rees-Mogg” stamp. “Absolutely delighted that he’s advertising me,” says Sir Jacob.Sir Jacob accepts the national polls are “not encouraging reading for the Conservatives”, but he urges caution at “an extrapolation of a national poll into a constituency poll” for the local projections.Voter Geoff Meek shakes Sir Jacob’s hand during canvassing in Longwell Green (The Independent)And on the doorstep in Longwell Green, the early signs are promising.After finishing talking to the woman on her front lawn, Sir Jacob goes to two addresses where people tell the former business secretary he has their vote. At the second address, a resident who is taking a break from fixing his dishwasher shares his main issues: “Immigration and the taxes if Labour get in.”But around the corner, problems arise for Sir Jacob and his team.First, a mother holding her three-month-old baby abruptly says she won’t be voting for Sir Jacob, then, at the next door, a man says he’s considering voting for Reform UK.The theme continues at the next semi-detached home where a family are working on an extension outside.“We have always voted Tory but we’re feeling really disappointed,” says one of them. “People feel they [the Conservative Party] haven’t delivered on the things they promised to do. We are losing our culture because of mass migration.”Sir Jacob accepts their frustration. “We made a mistake,” he says, pointing to an expanded migrant labour force after the Covid pandemic. Legal migration is coming back under control, he says.But it doesn’t end there.One of the family draws parallels between Sir Jacob, Nigel Farage and Reform UK. “Why not be Reform?” he asks.“The party is bigger than the leader – the membership of the party has the view I have,” replies Sir Jacob, who goes on to openly question the quality of candidates standing for Reform.“A vote for them is a vote for Lib Dems or Labour,” he adds.But then he finds more support.Self-employed builder Geoff Meek, 58, stops work on a semi-detached property to shake Sir Jacob’s hand. “Things are going well for us,” he says, pointing to a rise in the national insurance threshold.Couple David and Ann Hockney also warmly welcome Sir Jacob at the doorstep of their home, although Ms Hockney, 71, admits she’s toying with voting for Reform UK. “Immigration,” she says, when I ask why.Down one cul-de-sac, at a large detached home, a woman who shakes Sir Jacob’s hand jokes she won’t wash her hands again.A retired man, Mike Morrison, standing outside his garage also gives the incumbent his backing.The 87-year-old, who has lived in the area for 43 years, tells Sir Jacob the former Tory MP Chris Skidmore, who resigned from his Kingswood seat over Mr Sunak’s oil and gas licence plan in January, used to live around the corner.Mark Bray tells Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg he’s undecided on who to vote for. Asked what the big issues are locally, he points toward a 5G mast near his home (The Independent)“The rotter,” quips Mr Morrison.That’s the next stop; Mr Skidmore’s old address, a detached home with a large driveway. Owner Martyn Chugg says he’ll be voting for Sir Jacob, adding that Reform UK’s manifesto is in “cuckoo land”.The 70-year-old says affordable housing is a big issue of the election, with his son in his thirties still living at the family home.As I watch the canvassers begin to wrap up the morning’s proceedings, plumber Anthony Murphy, 44, tells Sir Jacob he’ll be voting Reform. “Nigel is the only one who talks sense,” he tells me.I ask Sir Jacob how it’s gone.“It seems pretty encouraging,” he says, “but you’ve got to be careful. People are nice and good-mannered, and if someone’s polite to you it doesn’t necessarily mean they will be voting Conservative for you.“It’s very easy to assume a friendly comment, even a selfie, means they are a supporter, but it’s not always true.”Back in the office for lunch, where Sir Jacob has a Greggs ham and cheese sandwich and a box of eclairs, I put to him the possibility of losing his seat.“If you throw your hat in the ring, you must expect that sometimes people will throw the hat back at you,” he says.I then ask if he’s worried it could provide a “Portillo” moment – when former Tory leader contender Michael Portillo was defeated in 1997 – on election night.“If you look at the opinion polls, there can be about 100 Portillo moments,” Sir Jacob adds, with a laugh. “Portillo will have bred and taken over the world if it’s going quite the way the opinion polls indicate, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens.”The interview ends, and I realise I’ve been sipping Sir Jacob’s black coffee.“Oh, don’t worry,” he says, with a smile, as I leave him to finish lunch with his agent and mother ahead of a busy afternoon of canvassing in the battle for his political career.","Boris, a Jaguar XJL and a Greggs: on the campaign trail with Jacob Rees-Mogg",9,9
2,"A Conservative candidate is being investigated by the Gambling Commission over a bet relating to the timing of the snap election announcement.Laura Saunders, who is the candidate for Bristol North West, is the second Tory member to face gambling allegations after Craig Williams apologised over betting on the date of the general election.It comes as a police officer in Rishi Sunak’s close protection team was arrested and suspended over alleged bets about the timing of the general election.The prime minister is facing another blow after a mega-poll predicted the Tories are set to suffer the party’s worst loss in more than a century with senior Cabinet ministers losing their seats.With just two weeks to go before the general election, the Blue Wall could be shaking as safe seats like Jeremy Hunt’s constituency in South West Surrey is set to fall, the survey predicts.But Michael Gove is convinced the party can still “defy the polls” and turn the result around and has vowed the Tories will fight as “we’re not in ‘Fergie time’ yet”.Key PointsSecond Tory candidate facing questions over election date gamblingProbed Tory facing betting allegations married to party campaign directorGove: Tories betting on election date ‘deeply disturbing’Labour: ‘Tory betting allegations show pattern of cronyism'Labour chair forced to resign for backing Jeremy CorbynTories set for worst election result since First World WarConservatives slam Labour over home taxes09:00 , Salma OuaguiraWe're making it easier for you to buy a home.Labour want to hike up tax on your home.That's the choice in this election. pic.twitter.com/PGvs7qdKnX— Conservatives (@Conservatives) June 20, 2024Gove: Labour to install ‘yes men and women' in public bodies08:56 , Salma OuaguiraLabour could install “yes men and women” in public bodies if it wins a large majority at the election, Michael Gove has said.Arguing Labour would use a large majority to “rig the system” and ensure it remained in power, the cabinet minister told the BBC: “My concern is that Labour would use whatever tools they have, if they have that sort of level of unchecked power in the Commons, to entrench it.“I think there are a number of other things that they would seek to do as well, for example make sure that many of the public bodies that we all rely on to help to run our lives, instead of having a balance of people from across the political spectrum with real skills that will help, I think there may be a tendency for them to put people who will be yes men and women in.“That is certainly a concern that I’ve heard from voters in some of the conversations that I’ve had and I do think that it is a factor.”Labour chair forced to resign for backing Jeremy Corbyn08:48 , Salma OuaguiraThe Labour chair of Islington North has been forced to resign after she was spotted campaigning for Jeremy Corbyn, the Jewish News reports.Alison McGarry reportedly asked locals in her constituency to support the former Labour leader who is standing as an independent candidate.After facing a potential expulsion from the party, Ms McGarry eventually decided to resign instead.Labour: ‘Tory betting allegations damaging to politics'08:43 , Salma OuaguiraShadow housing minister Matt Pennycook has condemned Laura Saunders, who is married to the Tory campaign director, after it emerged she is being investigated for alegedly betting about the general election date.Mr Pennycook says: “I think it does seriously chip away at trust and confidence, in the government and in politics more widely.“And we’ve had too much of that over the last 14 years.“I sort of hesitate slightly, but this appears with each one of these new allegations to be looking like a pattern of cronyism, if you like, with people benefiting directly, potentially, from information that may have been passed on.”Shadow housing minister Matt Pennycook speaking on Sky News (Sky News)Tory candidate being probed over election betting married to party campaign director08:33 , Salma OuaguiraLaura Saudners, who is the party candidate in Bristol North West, is married to the director of campaigns of the Conservative party Tony Lee, the BBC reports.The Tory candidate is currently being looked into by the Gambling Commission over an alleged bet about the date of the general election.A Conservative Party spokesman told the BBC: “We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals.

He says: “There are opinion polls, as I’ve acknowledged and as we both know, that are not great, but it’s not the 90th minute, we’re not in ‘Fergie time’ yet.“There is still an opportunity for us to make these arguments and as we make these arguments my experience – and I know it’s just me and a range of seats, not every seat in the country – my experience is that when you do talk to voters, outline some of the tax dangers, outline some of Labour’s plans for the future, then people do think twice and people do recognise that by voting Conservatives you are both ensuring that there is a strong Conservative voice in Parliament, but also you are doing everything you can to prevent a series of tax increases that won’t just hit pensioners and first-time buyers, but also will hit the economy in the guts.”He added: “I’m a Scotland fan, so you wait until the final whistle.“Sometimes it looks as though the odds are against you, but you keep on fighting.” (Sky News)Michael Gove: Tories betting on election date ‘deeply disturbing’07:34 , Salma OuaguiraThe housing secretary is speaking to Sky News as part of the morning media round.

188,"Rishi Sunak has announced a general election for July 4, as the country prepares for its first national vote since 2019.Here, The Telegraph examines the processes involved, including how votes are called and who can take part.When is the general election?Why is there an election now?Why was the general election not on the same day as the local elections?What happens next?How are general elections called?How often are elections called?Who can vote in the general election?When should I register to vote?When will polling take place?When is the general election?The general election will take place on July 4 as the country heads to the polls between 7am and 10pm to have their say on the next prime minister. It had looked likely that Rishi Sunak would wait until the autumn to call the next election, but the Prime Minister announced in a rain-sodden speech outside of Downing Street on May 22 that July 4 was the chosen date.Follow The Telegraph’s live general election coverageMany assumed Mr Sunak would want more time for the new Rwanda deterrent and recent tax cuts to take effect, having described a ballot in the second half of the year as his “working assumption”.But speculation reached fever pitch in Westminster when the Conservatives refused to rule out an election being called that day. That afternoon, an umbrella-less Mr Sunak announced his snap election decision and set in motion the vote to happen six weeks later on July 4.The choice means that Mr Sunak will have been in No 10 for 618 days by the polling date and has been called a “mistake” by figures like Prof Sir John Curtice, the polling expert.Why is there an election now?Tory figures close to general election planning had also been working under the assumption there was not going to be a summer ballot, but that all changed on May 22.Lord Cameron cut a trip to Albania short in order to return to a Cabinet meeting and Grant Shapps delayed a flight to a Nato meeting two hours to be there.On the day of the announcement, news came that the rate of inflation had fallen even further than expected, which Mr Sunak hailed as a sign that “everything is heading in the right direction”.With the Government’s record perhaps at its strongest on the economy, the Prime Minister was keen to use the news as a launchpad for triggering the election – but what else played into his decision?Key factors for the Prime Minister would have included whether economic statistics was continuing to improve, and whether polling and focus group research suggested that voters were feeling the positive effects of the National Insurance cuts, crediting the Tories for the boost.Getting Rwanda deportation flights off the ground also strengthened the case for going to the polls in the summer, along with a steady decline in the NHS elective waiting list.It had been rumoured that figures in Downing Street were mulling over whether it would be in the Tories’ interests to trigger a ballot sooner rather than later, despite being way behind Labour in the polls.Why was the general election not on the same day as the local elections?The general election could have been called on May 2 - the same day as the locals - but Rishi Sunak made the decision to avoid a spring poll.The Institute for Government pointed out that a spring election would avoid the risk that “a heavy defeat in the local elections could increase pressure on the Prime Minister – including from within his party – and make it difficult to regain momentum ahead of an election that would by then be less than a year away”.However, that opportunity passed. On March 14, the Prime Minister ruled out a national ballot on May 2, confirming there “won’t be a general election on that day”.It was thought that heavy losses at the locals could tempt restless Tory MPs to mount a challenge against their leader.However, despite a dire set of results for the Conservatives, resulting in hundreds of council seats lost, the rebels appear to have backed off for now.What happens next? Following Mr Sunak’s announcement on May 22, Parliament was prorogued and dissolved eight days later on May 30 after the Prime Minister was granted permission by the King Charles.Prorogation happened on May 24, in line with the 2022 Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act that sets out polling day to take place 25 working days following the dissolution on May 30, landing the general election on July 4.Election candidates have begun to use the six-week lead up to ballot day to campaign for their parties, including both Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer who have undertaken appearances up and down the country.Both leaders, and many other political figures, have also taken part in TV election debates in a bid to win over voters and released their 2024 party manifestos, starting with the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives. It is up to each party when to publish its manifesto, but an analysis by the Institute for Government shows that all Labour and Conservative manifestos since 1997 have been launched between 18 and 29 days before the election.How are general elections called?It is up to the Prime Minister to decide when to hold a national vote, but this power has only been restored in recent years.In 2011, the Fixed Term Parliaments Act effectively put the House of Commons in charge, with general elections held every five years unless a majority of MPs willed it otherwise.For an election to be called early, two thirds of the House had to back the plans. This is how Theresa May’s snap election was triggered in 2017. Alternatively, MPs could spark a ballot by passing a vote of no confidence in the Government.After trying and failing three times to secure the necessary two thirds majority for an early vote in 2019, the Tories opted to circumvent the law with a new purpose-built piece of legislation - the Early Parliamentary General Election Act - which required only a simple majority to pass. This paved the way for Boris Johnson’s snap election in 2019.The Government went on to repeal the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, replacing it with the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act. This new law stripped the Commons of its power to block an early ballot, putting the Prime Minister back in control.Traditionally, the Prime Minister travels to Buckingham Palace to request the dissolution of Parliament, before returning to Downing Street to announce the forthcoming election.How often are elections called? Each Parliament must be dissolved for a general election by the fifth anniversary of the day it first met.This measure was passed under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act by the 2011 coalition government, which set in stone the five-year periods between general elections.Elections may be held earlier – such occurred in 2017 with Theresa May and 2019 by Boris Johnson following a Brexit deadlock – under special circumstances.However, local elections such as the May 2024 by-elections and mayoral elections operate on a different time scale. Who can vote in the general election?The vast majority of UK adults can vote in a general election.In order to vote, you must:be registered to votebe 18 or over on the day of the election (‘polling day’)be a British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizenbe a resident at an address in the UK or Gibraltar, or living abroad and registered as an overseas voter (it is also possible to register if you have no fixed address)not be legally excluded from voting (for example, if you are serving a prison sentence)When should I register to vote?The deadline for registering to vote has now passed. Registration usually stays open until midnight at the end of the 12th working day before polling day, meaning the window closed on June 18 at 11.59pm. The deadline to vote by post passed the following day at 5pm.For those who are registered, it is still possible to apply for a proxy vote until 5pm on June 26.When will polling take place?Parliament was dissolved a few days after the election announcement and polling day takes place 25 working days after that.The Civil Service has entered “purdah” – the period between an election being called and polling day which involves strict restrictions on the work of officials to ensure that Whitehall resources are not being used to benefit any party in particular.",When is the general election?

358,"UK voters will head to the polls to elect the next prime minister in two weeks' time on 4 July.Political parties have been busy campaigning following the snap election announcement by Rishi Sunak, who revealed the vote would be held on Thursday 4 July.The Conservatives are currently trailing Labour by a significant margin in the polls, with the latest polling figures showing Labour projected to potentially secure a record number of MPs and the Sunak himself in danger of losing his seat, which would make him the first sitting prime minister to do so.Other high-profile Tory MPs - including Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Liz Truss - are also facing the prospect of being ousted by voters.Some tactical voting campaigners are eager to make this a reality - with the Conservatives (as the sitting party in government) the most likely to be on the sharp end of such initiatives.Indeed, the Best for Britain campaign group says it wants to inflict the “heaviest possible election defeat” on the Conservatives. It believes that its GetVoting.org initiative could help oust several prominent Tories, including Sunak and Hunt.What is tactical voting?Tactical voting is when someone chooses to vote for a candidate who would not be their first choice, or perhaps a candidate they would not even have considered voting for previously.The idea is that by voting for that candidate, you are doing your bit to stop another candidate winning.It tends to apply in constituencies where two candidates are close in numbers, and significantly out in front of their opponents.Some voters employ tactical voting as a strategy to counter the UK's 'First Past The Post' (FPTP) voting system, where a candidate with the most votes wins.This can result in an MP being elected even though the majority of voters supported candidates from a different political spectrum.For example, a Conservative candidate may win in their local constituency if the vote is divided between left-wing candidates from the Labour and Green Party.Voters will head to the [polls on 4 July. (Getty)How does tactical voting work?A scenario where tactical voting could come into play is when a voter’s preferred candidate is likely to come third with no realistic chance of winning.In this case, the voter could vote tactically by choosing to vote for one of the two candidates who will win the seat.John Boken, a 43-year-old secondary school teacher from Oswestry, is one of millions of registered voters who is preparing to cast his vote for a party that is not his top preference.Despite his inclination towards Labour, Boken feels he has to support the Liberal Democrats to prevent the Conservative candidate from securing the seat in his constituency.An example of tactical voting in action would be a traditional Labour voter who voted for Brexit in 2016 opting to vote for the Conservative candidate in their constituency in the hope of getting a Tory majority and avoiding a hung parliament which they may fear would lead to a second EU referendum.On the other hand, a traditional Tory voter who wants the UK to remain in the EU could lend their vote to the Labour or Lib Dem candidates in a bid to avoid a Conservative majority government.Meanwhile, back in 1997, tactical voting group Get Rid of Them (Grot) targeted 90 seats across the country where tactical voting could secure the defeat of the Tory candidate.And in 2017, the then Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron called on traditional Tory and Labour supporters to vote tactically to bring Conservative numbers down.The argument against tactical votingOne problem with this approach, some argue, is that you end up with a situation where a voter is choosing a candidate who's policies they may disagree with.The Electoral Reform Society, a campaign group opposed to the first-past-the-post system, says switching to some form of proportional representation (PR) would remove the need for tactical voting.Such a system would see, for example, a party that receives one-third of the vote expecting to gain one-third of the seats in parliament.They say this would remove much of the impetus for voters to try and hack their way around the current system.In a blog post on the group's website in 2022, Willie Sullivan wrote: ""No voter should have to vote tactically. But tactical voting is an inevitable symptom of our failing first-past-the-post system used for Westminster elections.""As voters are given just one preference and only one candidate can become the MP in each constituency, votes for all the other candidates go to waste. This all-or-nothing system means that voters have to choose between voting with their hearts or working around the system to get the best outcome in their area.""This kind of voter behaviour is ... sadly a symptom of our electoral system anytime votes head to the polls. The 2019 general election was the most recent example of a ‘hold your nose’ election – where millions of voters were forced to vote for the ‘least worst option.""Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

392,"“Middle Britons” with no political affiliation are likely to decide the outcome of the election by swinging the result in marginal constituencies, research suggests.According to analysis by the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen), middle Britons will be the most important of six political “tribes” on July 4 because they dominate two-thirds of the marginal seats being fought over by the Conservatives and Labour.Earlier this year, Prof Sir John Curtice and Lovisa Moller, NatCen’s director of analysis, led a team to categorise the British electorate into six groups based on the British social attitudes survey.Middle Britons describes a group of people mostly sitting in the middle ground when it comes to their views across a range of issues.Left-wing narrativesAccording to NatCen, people with a middle-Briton opinion profile express mild agreement with Left-wing narratives, are divided in their attitudes towards tax-and-spend policies, largely neutral on equal opportunities and agree on the need to be tough on crime.Critically, people in the group do not see themselves as a supporter of any particular party.NatCen’s research shows that this opinion profile dominates marginal seats contested between the Conservatives and Labour in 2019, and also represents an important segment of support for Reform UK, the Scottish National Party and the Liberal Democrats.In the 90 English and Welsh seats where Labour would have been the runner-up to the Tories in 2019, with a gap of less than 20 per cent of the votes, about two-thirds have middle Britons as the dominant voter segment.This includes “red wall” seats such as Ashfield, Bishop Auckland and Bolsover, as well new seats created by boundary changes for the 2024 election that would have been won with a narrow margin in 2019, including Birmingham Northfield, Leeds South West and Morley, and North Norfolk.Key voters for most partiesMiddle Britons are also the second-most important voter segment for most parties.Interviews by NatCen before the election campaign began found that the Tories, Labour, Reform, the SNP and the Lib Dems all had middle Britons as their second-most important supporter base, making up between 22 per cent and 28 per cent of each party’s estimated support at the time.NatCen published the briefing to coincide with a new data release which will allow people to look up the demographic profile of each constituency in England and Wales, including which of the six voter types most dominate in that seat.As well as middle Britons, the other groups are: well-off traditionalists, apolitical centrists, left-behind patriots, urban progressives and soft-Left liberals.The Tories derive the biggest source of their support from well-off traditionalists, who make up 38 per cent of their supporter base.For Labour, the Green Party and the SNP, urban progressives are the biggest segment among their voters, making up 28 per cent, 37 per cent and 35 per cent of their respective support bases.‘Left-behind patriots’Soft-Left liberals are the number one segment for the Lib Dems (32 per cent) and left-behind patriots are the lead group for Reform (33 per cent).Ms Moller said: “We hope these tools will enable political commentators and others to assess the voter coalitions that parties are seeking to appeal to, and how this might shape their campaigning.“It will also, post election, give us a sense of how people voted, and insight into the range of opinion profiles that any winning party or parties will need to take into account once in power.”",Middle Britons – the political tribe who will decide the election,10,11
305,"The Gambling Commission is investigating a second Tory candidate for taking a bet on the date of the election who may have had inside knowledge ahead of Rishi Sunak’s surprise announcement, the BBC has reported.The candidate understood to be under investigation is Laura Saunders, who is runnig for the Tories in Bristol North West and has worked for the party since 2015. It was also revealed that she is married to Tony Lee, the Conservative Party’s director of campaigns.Two candidates linked to the prime minister’s inner circle are being investigated over betting on the election date (James Manning/PA Wire)This follows an admission by one of the prime minister’s closest aides Crag Williams that he “took a flutter” on the election date just days before it was announced.It has led to concerns of corruption in Mr Sunak’s inner circle using inside knowledge to profit from betting.Craig Williams served as the Prime Minister’s parliamentary private secretary and is under investigation over an alleged bet (UK Parliament/PA) (PA Media)Asked about reports the Gambling Commission was investigating a second Conservative candidate for placing a bet on the date of the election, Mr Gove told the BBC: “If people have used inside information to place bets, that is deeply wrong.“What I can’t do is sort of get too much into the detail of the case while an investigation is going on.“But I can talk about the broad principle and you’re absolutely right, it’s reprehensible.”Michael Gove has said it would be “reprehensible” for someone to use inside information to bet on the date of the General Election.Mr Williams, who was Mr Sunak’s parliamentary private secretary, has since returned the money and apologised but is also under investigation from the Gambling Commisson.But pressure is mounting for the Tories to take tougher action after it was reported a close protection officer for the prime minister was suspended by the Metropolitan Police and being investigated.Ms Saunders has not commented on the allegation.However, a Conservative Party spokesman told the BBC: “We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals. As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn’t be proper to comment further, until any process is concluded.”Following the revelations about the police officer, the Lib Dems said there needed to be a wider inquiry into what had happened.Liberal Democrats deputy leader Daisy Cooper, responding to news of the police officer’s arrest, said: “Rishi Sunak must call a Cabinet Office inquiry into what is shaping up to be yet another scandal at the heart of Government.“This stinks of yet more sleaze and answers are needed. An inquiry is needed to understand who knew what and when.”It is understood that the Met was contacted by the Gambling Commision on 14 June to be told that it was investigating alleged bets made by a police constable from the Met’s Royalty and Specialist Protection Command.The Met told the BBC: “The matter was immediately referred to officers in the Met’s Directorate of Professional Standards, who opened an investigation, and the officer was also removed from operational duties.”",Tory scandal grows as second candidate linked to Sunak’s inner circle faces questions over election date gambling,10,9
93,"Jeremy Corbyn is within touching distance of pulling off a shock win in Islington North, according to a new poll.The MRP survey by YouGov has Labour beating its former leader, who is standing as an independent.But the race in this north London constituency is so tight that YouGov describes it as a “toss up”.The pollster classified this seat as such as this contest could be settled by fewer than five points.It put Labour on 41 per cent, with Mr Corbyn on 36 per cent.As the general election hots up, The Evening Standard has drawn up an interactive map of all the key battlegrounds in London on July 4.The YouGov poll also showed the political establishment facing a second potential blow, with Reform UK leader Nigel Farage set to win in Clacton, which would make him an MP at the eighth time of trying.Reform UK is also in line for second place finishes in eight London seats, taking around 27 per cent of the vote in Dagenham and Rainham, according to the survey.Mr Farage’s party is set to win around a fifth of the vote in five seats (including two that are tight Labour/Tory races) which are Bexleyheath and Crayford, Hornchurch and Upminster, Romford and Old Bexley and Sidcup, as well as Dagenham and Rainham.Ahead of the election, Labour chiefs refused to allow Mr Corbyn to stand as their candidate in the seat he has represented since 1983, after the anti-semitism storm during his leadership.Local Labour councillor Praful Nargund is instead the party’s candidate.But Leftwinger Mr Corbyn has a strong local following and this race appears to still be open as to who will win.If the former leader did pull off a surprise win it would be a blow to Sir Keir Starmer.Some Labour party members in Islington North have accused the leadership of acting undemocratically in blocking them from selected Mr Corbyn as their candidate, a claim rejected by Sir Keir.The Tories are set to lose a string of seats across London on July 4, according to the poll.They would be left with just six constituencies: Bromley and Biggin Hill, Finchley and Golders Green, Hornchurch and Upminster, Orpington, Romford, and Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner.The Conservatives would be wiped out in Inner London, losing Cities of London and Westminster, Chelsea and Fulham, and the new constituency of Kensington and Bayswater.The Liberal Democrats would also gain three seats from the Tories; Wimbledon, Sutton and Cheam, as well as Carshalton and Wallington.The Conservatives are on course to finish second in 32 constituencies in London, though three of them are “toss ups” – Croydon South, Harrow East, and Old Bexley and Sidcup, where Labour is narrowly ahead in all three.How London’s political map will look on July 5, according to new YouGov poll (YouGov)YouGov said its latest study projects Labour is on course to achieve a 200-seat majority nationwide.Labour is predicted to secure 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.YouGov used a technique known as MRP (multi-level regression and post-stratification) to model the outcome of the election in every constituency across Britain.It said the estimated seat projections were based on modelled responses from 36,161 adults in England and Wales, and 3,818 in Scotland.","Jeremy Corbyn close to shock Islington North win in London at General Election, new poll",10,0

that Labour would use whatever tools they have, if they have that sort of level of unchecked power in the Commons, to entrench it.“I think there are a number of other things that they would seek to do as well, for example make sure that many of the public bodies that we all rely on to help to run our lives, instead of having a balance of people from across the political spectrum with real skills that will help, I think there may be a tendency for them to put people who will be yes men and women in.“That is certainly a concern that I’ve heard from voters in some of the conversations that I’ve

150,"On display inside Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg’s untidy office are three large portraits: Sir Winston Churchill, Boris Johnson and himself.They hang from cream-coloured wallpaper behind a cluttered wooden desk at the centre of the HQ for Sir Jacob’s uphill campaign to win the North East Somerset and Hanham constituency – his fifth straight term in the area.“Boris went up when he became leader... we always had the leader up,” says Sir Jacob, looking up at the pictures. “Then Covid came and we’ve hardly used the office since.”No Liz Truss, then. But what about Rishi Sunak, will he get his place next to Churchill?‘Um... well, we will eventually,” Sir Jacob says, with a wry smile. “We’ll see how much we need it after the election, when he’s returned comfortably as PM. Yes, absolutely.”It’s 17 days to polling day on 4 July and I’m in Keynsham, on the edge of Bristol, following Sir Jacob’s general election campaign.The HQ for Sir Jacob’s campaign is a hive of activity ahead of morning canvassing (The Independent)Hidden down an alleyway between Bargain Booze and a local solicitor’s firm, it’s a struggle at first to find the office (I initially mistake it for the former Keynsham and District Conservative Club, where early-morning drinkers are sipping their first pint) but I get there eventually.Boxes of delivery leaflets cover most of the carpeted floor while the chairs and the steep stairwell are filled with around eight friendly members sipping coffee and chatting before the day’s canvassing.“The national polls... you know, we don’t read those,” says Margaret Brewer, Sir Jacob’s upbeat agent, with the latest poll from Ipsos projecting the worst post-war result for the Tory party.Suddenly, Sir Jacob appears at the doorway wearing a dark grey double-breasted suit with a large blue rosette.We shake hands before he picks an issue up with his agent. The local BBC channel is planning an election debate, and he’s concerned the Green Party candidate has not been invited.A map showing the redrawn constituency is displayed in Jacob Rees-Mogg’s office (The Independent)“It doesn’t seem fair,” he says, showing genuine concern, before heading outside to discuss the plan for the day in private.Sir Jacob was elected MP for North East Somerset 14 years ago. It’s a constituency he’s comically described as circling the city of Bath – where Lib Dem Wera Hobhouse was previously MP – like dough around the jam in a doughnut.But his political rite of passage came in 1997 when he was parachuted into a virtually unwinnable seat for the Tory party in Central Fife. A quick search online reveals pictures of the smartly dressed 27-year-old knocking on working-class doors.“There was no Bentley, sadly,” Sir Jacob laughs, correcting subsequent media coverage as he fondly recalls the campaign. “I’d knock on people’s doors and say, ‘I’m Jacob Rees-Mogg, I’m the Conservative candidate, can I count on you for your support?’“More often than not, people would laugh ... they did think it was very funny that a Tory was asking for their vote.”Fast forward 27 years, and electoral campaigning for Sir Jacob remains “very similar” – although in Longwell Green, where we are heading for canvassing today, the reception is likely to be different.The pretty urban suburb on the edge of east Bristol has a strong Conservative following – five out of the six local councillors are Tories – which Sir Jacob wants to cement ahead of the general election.‘More often than not, people would laugh,’ says Sir Jacob, thinking back to his first election campaign in Central Fife (Getty/Colin McPherson)And unlike on the Central Fife campaign, there’s no family nanny, Veronica Crook, in tow while knocking on doors – although his mother, Lady Gillian Rees-Mogg, does show up in the afternoon to help in the office.It takes eight minutes to drive from Keynsham to Longwell Green, where it doesn’t take long to spot the lanky figure of Sir Jacob talking to a woman in a cul-de-sac, or his smart Jaguar XJL parked nearby.This is a leafy area with a modern housing estate of large semi-detached homes, many with pristine front gardens. With the sun out, many residents are busy mowing lawns and cutting hedges.The area, like the neighbouring wards of Bitton and Hanham, will join the old North Somerset constituency as part of boundary changes at the election.But polling isn’t looking good for Sir Jacob.Labour’s Dan Norris, mayor of the West of England and former MP for the seat, is projected to win comfortably, with 42 per cent of the vote according to Survation’s MRP, followed by Sir Jacob on 27 per cent, Lib Dems on 14 per cent and Reform UK with 12 per cent.Mr Norris’s election leaflet features a “Stop Rees-Mogg” stamp. “Absolutely delighted that he’s advertising me,” says Sir Jacob.Sir Jacob accepts the national polls are “not encouraging reading for the Conservatives”, but he urges caution at “an extrapolation of a national poll into a constituency poll” for the local projections.Voter Geoff Meek shakes Sir Jacob’s hand during canvassing in Longwell Green (The Independent)And on the doorstep in Longwell Green, the early signs are promising.After finishing talking to the woman on her front lawn, Sir Jacob goes to two addresses where people tell the former business secretary he has their vote. At the second address, a resident who is taking a break from fixing his dishwasher shares his main issues: “Immigration and the taxes if Labour get in.”But around the corner, problems arise for Sir Jacob and his team.First, a mother holding her three-month-old baby abruptly says she won’t be voting for Sir Jacob, then, at the next door, a man says he’s considering voting for Reform UK.The theme continues at the next semi-detached home where a family are working on an extension outside.“We have always voted Tory but we’re feeling really disappointed,” says one of them. “People feel they [the Conservative Party] haven’t delivered on the things they promised to do. We are losing our culture because of mass migration.”Sir Jacob accepts their frustration. “We made a mistake,” he says, pointing to an expanded migrant labour force after the Covid pandemic. Legal migration is coming back under control, he says.But it doesn’t end there.One of the family draws parallels between Sir Jacob, Nigel Farage and Reform UK. “Why not be Reform?” he asks.“The party is bigger than the leader – the membership of the party has the view I have,” replies Sir Jacob, who goes on to openly question the quality of candidates standing for Reform.“A vote for them is a vote for Lib Dems or Labour,” he adds.But then he finds more support.Self-employed builder Geoff Meek, 58, stops work on a semi-detached property to shake Sir Jacob’s hand. “Things are going well for us,” he says, pointing to a rise in the national insurance threshold.Couple David and Ann Hockney also warmly welcome Sir Jacob at the doorstep of their home, although Ms Hockney, 71, admits she’s toying with voting for Reform UK. “Immigration,” she says, when I ask why.Down one cul-de-sac, at a large detached home, a woman who shakes Sir Jacob’s hand jokes she won’t wash her hands again.A retired man, Mike Morrison, standing outside his garage also gives the incumbent his backing.The 87-year-old, who has lived in the area for 43 years, tells Sir Jacob the former Tory MP Chris Skidmore, who resigned from his Kingswood seat over Mr Sunak’s oil and gas licence plan in January, used to live around the corner.Mark Bray tells Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg he’s undecided on who to vote for. Asked what the big issues are locally, he points toward a 5G mast near his home (The Independent)“The rotter,” quips Mr Morrison.That’s the next stop; Mr Skidmore’s old address, a detached home with a large driveway. Owner Martyn Chugg says he’ll be voting for Sir Jacob, adding that Reform UK’s manifesto is in “cuckoo land”.The 70-year-old says affordable housing is a big issue of the election, with his son in his thirties still living at the family home.As I watch the canvassers begin to wrap up the morning’s proceedings, plumber Anthony Murphy, 44, tells Sir Jacob he’ll be voting Reform. “Nigel is the only one who talks sense,” he tells me.I ask Sir Jacob how it’s gone.“It seems pretty encouraging,” he says, “but you’ve got to be careful. People are nice and good-mannered, and if someone’s polite to you it doesn’t necessarily mean they will be voting Conservative for you.“It’s very easy to assume a friendly comment, even a selfie, means they are a supporter, but it’s not always true.”Back in the office for lunch, where Sir Jacob has a Greggs ham and cheese sandwich and a box of eclairs, I put to him the possibility of losing his seat.“If you throw your hat in the ring, you must expect that sometimes people will throw the hat back at you,” he says.I then ask if he’s worried it could provide a “Portillo” moment – when former Tory leader contender Michael Portillo was defeated in 1997 – on election night.“If you look at the opinion polls, there can be about 100 Portillo moments,” Sir Jacob adds, with a laugh. “Portillo will have bred and taken over the world if it’s going quite the way the opinion polls indicate, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens.”The interview ends, and I realise I’ve been sipping Sir Jacob’s black coffee.“Oh, don’t worry,” he says, with a smile, as I leave him to finish lunch with his agent and mother ahead of a busy afternoon of canvassing in the battle for his political career.","Boris, a Jaguar XJL and a Greggs: on the campaign trail with Jacob Rees-Mogg",10,9
370,"While the British election process plays out, Russia continues its cruel and vicious aggression against the Ukrainian people with new war crime allegations continually emerging. A furious Putin threatens to supply Britain’s enemies with missiles that can strike the UK itself, in revenge for Britain supplying Ukraine with long-range storm shadow weapons.Iran carried out a massive bombardment of Israel which only avoided mass civilian casualties due to the defensive capabilities of Israel’s Western allies. Iran’s proxies, Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis continue to destabilise the Middle East with the latter attacking British-linked shipping and Royal Naval vessels.All the while, China flexes its muscles in the South China Sea and continues its cyber attacks against Western democratic states. Yet the lack of focus on Britain’s national security in this dangerous world and the obsession in most of the media with polls and personalities risks turning this into a cartoon election in a hardback world.The first duty of any British government is to keep the British people safe and this solemn responsibility has weighed heavily on the conscience of every prime minister.Boris Johnson, as prime minister, gave important international leadership on Ukraine, continued under Rishi Sunak, including at the much underreported G7 summit last week. As one American colleague on Capitol Hill put it to me, “if Britain hadn’t given the leadership it did to the West, the response to Ukraine in the US Congress would have been much more muted”. The consequences would have been profound indeed.Across the world an axis of authoritarian states is causing more instability, more rapidly, in more places and, along with its proxies, is attempting to reshape the world order against the fundamental values our country represents and that our troops have fought and died for – values of democracy, freedom and the rule of law. The ideological imperative is clear, and for the Conservatives it always has been – whether faced with the fascist regimes of the 1940s, the anti-nuclear movement of the 70s and 80s or the anti-Nato rhetoric of the Corbyn years.Which brings us to the current leader of the Labour Party and the man who would be prime minister in charge of our national security. This is the man who urged the nation to give Jeremy Corbyn the keys to No 10.When Keir Starmer said, “I do think Jeremy Corbyn would make a great prime minister”, did he mean the Jeremy Corbyn, who said, “I am against the replacement of Trident and the nuclear missile system that goes with it”?Did he mean the Jeremy Corbyn who said, “Wouldn’t it be wonderful if every politician around the world, instead of taking pride in the size of their armed forces, did what the people of Costa Rica have done and abolished their army.”Did he mean the Jeremy Corbyn who said, “Why don’t we turn it around and close down Nato” and “I’d rather we weren’t in it”?Maybe he meant the Jeremy Corbyn who said, “It will be my pleasure and my honour to host an event in Parliament where our friends from Hezbollah will be speaking… I’ve also invited friends from Hamas”?Having found it acceptable to urge the British people to make Jeremy Corbyn prime minister, how can anyone have confidence in Starmer’s judgement on our national security.Do we want an individual as prime minister who sat pliantly in shadow cabinet meetings, nodding his head to a man who entertained leaving Nato, scrapping the army, or sending chemical weapons back to Russia for analysis after the dreadful Salisbury attack?Can we risk the most powerful person in the country being someone who sat shoulder to shoulder with Diane Abbott, who once signed a parliamentary motion calling for the “abolition of conspiratorial groups like MI5”? Do we want individuals around the Cabinet table so strategically naive that they voted to scrap our nuclear deterrent?Remember that both Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader and David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, voted against the renewal of Trident in parliament.When disgruntled Tory voters say they want change they need to understand just how dangerous this “change” could be for Britain with a left-dominated Labour government.The Prime Minister has rightly committed to raising defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP, leading the European Nato nations. Threats will not abate in the coming years, security is not a certainty.Our adversaries are becoming stronger and more ambitious in their designs. In this complex strategic environment, do we really trust one of Jeremy Corbyn’s former lieutenants with British national security? The answer is emphatically and unequivocally not.","Keir Starmer, Corbyn’s old ally, is a threat to national security",10,11

We’ve got plenty of non-green belt areas that we can build on.Battle of the hard hats: Mr Gove said Labour would be 'unaccountable' - Leon Neal/Getty“But there are some bits of the green belt, disused car parks… We will take the tough decisions but of course we’re going to protect the green belt, as you’d expect.”Labour has promised to build 1.5 million homes over the course of the next Parliament if it forms the next government, and has said it will focus on what Sir Keir has called the “ugly, disused, grey” parts of green belt land.The party hopes to tap into widespread frustration over house prices and supply to overcome opposition from nature and community groups that want to protect open spaces.But the plans have already alarmed some campaigners, including the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), which has said it could lead to more speculative development.A spokesman for the CPRE said: “Keir Starmer is right that there are plenty of non-green belt areas crying out for houses to be built on them: there are enough shovel-ready brownfield sites for 1.2 million new homes in England alone.“If we didn’t already have the green belt we’d want to invent it. Green Belt land is the countryside next door for 30 million people in the UK and we welcome Labour’s manifesto commitment to protect it.”Michael Gove, the Levelling Up Secretary, said the comments in Politico suggest that “if Labour win an unaccountable majority, this shows they think they can do whatever they want”.He added that the Conservatives would achieve their pledge of building 1.6 million homes by abolishing stamp duty for the majority of first-time buyers and improving the Help to Buy scheme.",Starmer forced to deny he will ‘flatten the green belt’ for housing,10,11
200,"Rishi Sunak has not been seen today as he prepares for a Question Time debate tonight. LEON NEAL via Getty ImagesRishi Sunak is coming under mounting pressure to act over the betting scandal which has engulfed the Tories’ election campaign.The prime minister has been urged to suspend two Conservative candidates accused of laying wagers on the date of the election shortly before it was announced last month.One of them, Craig Williams, was Sunak’s parliamentary aide before parliament was dissolved.He has admitted having a “flutter”, prompting a Gambling Commission investigation.The other candidate is Laura Saunders, a member of Tory HQ staff whose husband, Tony Lee, is the party’s director of campaigns.Both of them are also being investigated, and Lee has taken a “leave of absence” from his post.In another extraordinary development in the controversy, one of the PM’s close protection officers has been suspended amid allegations that he also put a bet on a July poll.Pat McFadden, Labour’s national campaign co-ordinator has written to Sunak demanding he take action.He said: “Can I ask you very simply why you think that a serving police officer should be suspended from his role because of allegations that he made a bet based on inside information, while the two colleagues of yours who so far stand accused of the same offence ... are still being allowed to stand as Tory candidates in the election.“Surely you can understand that – yet again – this looks as though there is one rule for members of the Tory party, and another rule for everyone else, specifically on this occasion a serving police officer. If you can see how wrong that is, will you now at the very least remove your support for Mr Williams and Ms Saunders as Conservative election candidates?”The Conservatives have said they have been contacted by the Gambling Commission “about a small number of individuals”.But in his letter to Sunak, McFadden demanded to know “how wide this scandal goes”.He said: “If some of your most senior colleagues felt they had carte blanche to misuse the inside information they had on the election in order to make a profit, we must ask how many others had advance access to the same information, and placed bets either by themselves, or through their friends and family?“If you take the correct action now concerning Mr Williams and Ms Saunders – to ensure consistency with the treatment of your close protection officer – will you guarantee that anyone else who it emerges placed bets on the timing of the general election, whether in their own name or through a third party, will also be suspended?”Under the 2005 Gambling Act, the misuse of inside information when betting can lead to a prison sentence of up to two years.“No one is above the law and it is essential that the taint of corruption now surrounding the behaviour of some who may have known about the election date is properly investigated and punished,” McFadden said.Related...'Are The Tories Corrupt?'

234,"Rishi Sunak’s election campaign was dealt another blow on Thursday after it emerged that a second Conservative Party candidate was being investigated over a bet on the date of the general election.Laura Saunders, the Tory candidate for Bristol North West, is understood to be under investigation by the Gambling Commission (GC) over claims she may have had inside knowledge about the prime minister’s decision to call a snap poll for 4 July.Ms Saunders has worked for the party since 2015 and is married to Tony Lee, who works as the Conservative Party’s director of campaigns. Mr Lee has since taken a leave of absence after it came to light he was also being probed by the GC.According to the BBC, which first named Ms Saunders as the candidate under investigation, she worked most recently at the party’s international division at Conservative Campaign Headquarters, which works with other centre-right parties around the world.What are the rules for MPs and others on betting with inside knowledge?Using confidential information to gain an unfair advantage when betting may constitute a criminal offence.Gamblers are not allowed to use inside information to place a bet or to instruct someone else to do so on their behalf.They are also not allowed to pass inside information on to someone else which they use for betting.Laura Saunders (Laura Saunders)Additionally, the MPs’ code of conduct bars members from “causing significant damage to the reputation and integrity of the house”.An MP placing a bet with inside knowledge is likely to cross this threshold.Who else is being investigated?Ms Saunders became the second Tory candidate to be investigated by the Gambling Commission over claims of having insider knowledge about the 4 July poll.Craig Williams, the PM’s parliamentary private secretary, admitted placing a bet on the election prior to Mr Sunak’s announcement after he was approached by a journalist.The 39-year-old Tory candidate for Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr placed a £100 bet with 5-1 odds at Ladbrokes, meaning he would have won £500, but his name was raised as potentially a “politically exposed person”, so the wager was not registered.The bookmaker is believed to be particularly cautious over “novelty” betting markets such as the general election.According to The Guardian, which first reported the story, the bet was placed via an online account that would have required Mr Williams to provide personal details, including his date of birth and debit card. The bookmaker also knows the location of the bet.Ladbrokes declined to comment on the incident but the Gambling Commission issued a statement confirming that it was investigating.Mr Williams apologised after admiting that he had placed a wager on the bet, but refused to comment further while the GC carried out its probe.“I clearly made a huge error of judgment, that’s for sure, and I apologise,” he told. “I will not be expanding on my statement because it’s an independent process.”Close protection officer arrestedA police officer in Mr Sunak’s close protection team was arrested and suspended over alleged bets about the timing of the general election.The police constable from the Met’s Royalty and Specialist Protection Command was arrested on 17 June on suspicion of misconduct in public office after the betting watchdog contacted the force last Friday.The officer was taken into custody and bailed pending further enquiries, with the case being referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, according to the Met.What have senior Tories said about the scandal?Mr Sunak said it was “very disappointing” news that Mr Williams was being investigated by the GC.“Well, it’s very disappointing news and you would have seen Craig Williams say that it was a huge error of judgement,” he told broadcasters at the G7 summit earlier in June.Michael Gove, the outgoing cabinet minister, said it would be “reprehensible” to use inside information to bet on the general election date.“If people have used inside information to place bets, that is deeply wrong,” he told the BBC on Thursday morning after Ms Saunders’s case came to light.“What I can’t do is sort of get too much into the detail of the case while an investigation is going on.“But I can talk about the broad principle and you’re absolutely right, it’s reprehensible.”",Everything we know about Tory election betting scandal,10,9

He had a majority of 12,000 before the boundary change.In the wake of the revelation the Guardian also revealed that the Gambling Commission asked bookmakers to trawl through all substantial bets placed on a July election.The watchdog wrote to all licensed bookmakers requesting information on anyone who stood to gain more than £199 by betting on a July election in the UK.A Conservative party spokesperson told the BBC: “We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals. As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn’t be proper to comment further, until any process is concluded.”Keir Starmer called for the Conservatives to suspend Saunders. “This candidate should be suspended and it’s very telling that Rishi Sunak has not already done that. “If it was one of my candidates, they’d be gone and their feet would not have touched the floor.”Separately, one of Rishi Sunak’s close protection officers has been arrested over alleged bets about the timing of the election.The officer was arrested on Monday on suspicion of misconduct in public office, the Metropolitan police said.The Metropolitan police said they were contacted last Friday by the Gambling Commission, which informed the force that it was looking into alleged bets related to the timing of an election by a constable from the Met’s royalty and specialist protection command.“The matter was immediately referred to officers in the Met’s directorate of professional standards, who opened an investigation, and the officer was also removed from operational duties,” the force said.The matter has also been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), the watchdog responsible for overseeing the system for handling complaints made against police forces in England and Wales.The Met added: “The Gambling Commission continues to lead the investigation into the alleged betting offences, and our investigation is running in parallel to that.”Labour’s campaign chief, Pat McFadden, has written to Sunak urging the Conservatives to withdraw support from Saunders and Williams while they are being looked into.In a letter to the prime minister, McFadden said: “Can I ask you very simply why you think that a serving police officer should be suspended from his role, because of allegations that he made a bet based on inside information, while the two colleagues of yours who so far stand accused of the same offence – Craig Williams, your PPS, and Laura Saunders, a member of your CCHQ staff and partner of your campaigns director – are still being allowed to stand as Tory candidates in the election on 4 July?.”He added: “This looks as though there is one rule for members of the Tory party, and another rule for everyone else, specifically on this occasion a serving police officer.”McFadden said if it emerged that Williams, Saunders and any other candidate had placed bets on the timing of the election they should be suspended.",Gambling watchdog looks into second Tory candidate over alleged election bet,10,8

There’ll be an opportunity after the election, whatever the result, for us to assess where support may have waned, where it held, and where it might have improved.”Speaking at The Times CEO Summit, Jeremy Hunt, the Chancellor, said a Conservative win at the general election was not “the most likely outcome”.Asked whether he could win in his constituency, Mr Hunt said his seat was “too close to call” and that he was still meeting “a lot of people who say they haven’t yet made up their mind”.Earlier, Mr Gove warned that Labour could use a large majority to “rig the system” and create a “forever government”.He told Sky News: “I hope we are getting our message across on tax and one of the things is that if people do reflect on the polls, and of course some may, they will ask themselves this question: If Labour do have that really big majority, what is to stop them rigging the system?“What is to stop them giving votes to EU citizens, 16-year-olds, prisoners, and making sure that they could be a forever government?”He also urged colleagues not to turn further to the Right, saying the Tories had to espouse social justice.“Whatever happens – whether we win the election, which I hope we will, or we lose – the Conservative party is at its best when it embraces the spirit that we had in 2010 and 2019 of recognising that you need to be a party that appeals to every part of the country, in background and in geography,” he said.“We can’t be a party of just property owners – we need to be a party of renters and those who aspire to own property.“We can’t just be a party that safeguards those who have done well because of hard work, we’ve got to be a party on the side of those who aspire to both do better economically and contribute to society. In broad terms, the Conservative Party succeeds when it believes in hard work and enterprise, and social justice.”Mr Gove said he would not get into the issue of partygate and whether that was having any impact on the election.","Truss to blame if Tories lose election, suggests Gove",10,11
68,"Had this been a presidential election, Rishi Sunak would have come away from the Question Time debate feeling he had a good chance of winning.Where the audience made it clear to Sir Keir Starmer that they did not trust him, with Mr Sunak it was his party and his predecessors that they disliked, rather than him.Unfortunately for the Prime Minister, Britain does not have a directly elected leader, meaning the problems that have stacked up over the past 14 years, rather than the past 18 months under his premiership, will be what loses him the election, if the polls are right.Mr Sunak seemed more positive than of late, he spent less time apologising, he smiled and he seemed to connect with the audience better than Sir Keir had done.He also showed a welcome flash of steel when he was asked about the gambling allegations overshadowing the Tory campaign, telling the audience: “If anyone is found to have broken the rules I will make sure that they are booted out of the Conservative Party.”For a change, he looked like the man who was running the country, rather than a luckless challenger.There was, however, a wobble, and it came when he was pressed on the issue of compulsory national service, one of the Conservatives’ most eye-catching policies.How, Fiona Bruce asked, would he force young people to national service?“Sorry?” he spluttered, as if it was the first time he had been asked to consider it.There are a range of things other countries do to enforce national service, he said: driving licences, access to finance…Was he suggesting that anyone who did not do national service would be banned from driving? Or have their bank accounts closed? It certainly sounded like it.No no, he insisted - a Royal Commission would look at all of the alternatives and report back.He recovered from that and told the audience member who asked about trusting him to do better: “My grandparents came to this country with very little and I’m standing here as Prime Minister. I owe an enormous debt of gratitude to this country and I’m in this because of what this country has done for my family.”On the issue of whether Britain should leave the European Convention on Human Rights if it stood in the way of the Rwanda scheme, he said he would put the security of the country first and “I make no apology for that”.Several people in the audience shouted “shame!” but those back at Tory HQ are unlikely to have cared about that.They already know that committed Labour supporters don’t like the Rwanda scheme, and they will also know that for those concerned about immigration, seeing Mr Sunak standing up to them might just have won him back a few more votes from people flirting with Reform UK.",Sunak looked like a man who was running the country - until he wobbled,11,11
94,"Jeremy Corbyn would have made a better prime minister than Boris Johnson had he been elected in 2019, Sir Keir Starmer said.Sir Keir dodged a series of questions during a BBC Question Time debate on Thursday night over whether he truly believed his predecessor would have made a “great” prime minister, as he said five years ago.Host Fiona Bruce repeatedly challenged him over his one-time statement, with Sir Keir insisting: “It wasn’t a question that really arose because I didn’t think we were going to win the election.”Follow live updates hereBut when Bruce asked for a “yes” or “no” answer to whether he meant it, Sir Keir insisted that Mr Corbyn would have made a better prime minister than Mr Johnson.Sir Keir Starmer said he believed Jeremy Corbyn would have made a better PM than Boris Johnson (Stefan Rousseau/PA) (PA Wire)The Labour leader has in recent weeks sought to distance himself from Mr Corbyn, while his party is forecast by opinion polls to sweep to victory in the election.He criticised the Conservatives’ election offer as a “Jeremy Corbyn-style manifesto” that would “load everything into the wheelbarrow” without explaining how to pay for it.An audience member asked the Labour leader about his remarks. “You criticised the Tory manifesto as Jeremy Corbyn-like,” they said, adding: “Anything you want can go in it, nothing is costed. Why did you back his original manifesto in 2019?”Sir Keir replied: “In 2019 I campaigned for the Labour Party as I’ve always campaigned for the Labour Party.”He said that afterwards it became clear the electorate “thought it was too much and they wanted to see something which was fully costed and fully funded”.Jeremy Corbyn, who is standing as an independent in Islington North, has accused Sir Keir of ‘double standards’ over his comments (PA Wire)Mr Corbyn has accused his successor of attempting to rewrite history with his recent comments about the 2019 Labour manifesto.The now independent candidate for Islington North said Sir Keir had displayed “double standards” in expressing this opinion now, but not while serving in Mr Corbyn’s shadow cabinet.The BBC Question Time special also featured Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey and Scotland’s first minister John Swinney for the SNP, with prime minister Rishi Sunak up last.Sir Ed, who was first in the line-up, faced difficult questions about his record in the coalition years and as minister in the Horizon scandal.Mr Sunak also faced tough questions and at one point was met with boos and cries of “shame” when he claimed he would take the UK out of the European Court of Human Rights.","Jeremy Corbyn would have been better PM than Boris Johnson, says Keir Starmer",11,9
238,"SIR – I’m confused by those former Conservative voters swarming to Reform UK. In doing so they will only hand Labour an even larger majority (“Tory wipeout”, report, June 20), which will not be good for either the next parliament or our democracy.As a Labour supporter I’m strangely hoping that the shy Tory vote will appear at the last minute, as it has done before, and allow the party to provide some sort of opposition.Christian FroggattReigate, SurreySIR – The mandate for Boris Johnson in 2019 should have resulted in Tory government for many years – yet through arrogance, incompetence and lying, the party has achieved the most spectacular reversal. Absolutely criminal, in anyone’s book.Graham NicholsonRowlands Castle, HampshireSIR – Given the devastating predictions of your survey, it is obvious that Labour is heading for a landslide. The Tory mantra of “Vote Reform, get Labour” therefore has no traction.Conflicted voters are now free to back Reform with a clear conscience.George KellyBuckinghamSIR – A Labour landslide would be preferable to narrow win, as it would allow Sir Keir Starmer to keep his far-Left in check. In the meantime, Thatcherite Conservatives can vote Reform in order to send the Tories a badly needed message.Tony MarshallRudgwick, West SussexSIR – A Labour landslide with no opposition would be a disaster. After all, “power corrupts, while absolute power corrupts absolutely”. We may end up looking back on the past 14 years as the good old days.David CoverdaleLeeds, West YorkshireSIR – Now where did I put that “Don’t blame me – I voted Conservative” car sticker?Sue McNaughtonEastergate, West SussexSIR – Throughout my adult life I have held views that would be considered moderately Right-of-centre. I have always voted Tory, believing in compassionate conservatism. However, at this election there is no party representing my feelings, or those of millions of other people who would class themselves as “soft Right”.Labour is now reminiscent of Tony Blair’s party, but it is still Left-wing. The Liberal Democrats have become a centre-Left party. The Conservatives, through the efforts of people like Suella Braverman, and because of the threat from Reform, have lurched to the Right. This means that a whole swathe of voters like me have effectively been disenfranchised.Michael ThomasUffington, OxfordshireJust Stop Oil vandalsSIR – Having no conscience, Just Stop Oil protesters attacked Stonehenge (report, June 20). A line was crossed when Magna Carta was vandalised earlier this year. The courts must protect our heritage by making the punishment fit the crime.This is not protest. It’s cultural vandalism – and it won’t stop unless we act firmly.Dr Gerald Edwards GlasgowSIR – Cornflour – the substance thrown by Just Stop Oil protesters over Stonehenge – is probably one of the least damaging things for granite.Turning Stonehenge orange scores high on impact and low on damage. Isn’t that what we want from activists?David BurtonDorking, SurreySIR – I assume the Just Stop Oil protesters walked to Stonehenge and used no fossil-fuel-powered transport. Iain MaitlandSherborne, DorsetParking privilegesSIR – Recently I parked in a disabled bay, as my husband has a Blue Badge. On our return, I was informed by an operative that I was parked illegally, and should pay using the RingGo app (Letters, June 20). As I thought that a Blue Badge allowed me to park in a disabled bay or even on double-yellow lines, I questioned this, and was told that no allowances were made by that company for Blue Badge holders. If a Blue Badge allegedly gives us easier access for appointments and so on, then I am at a loss as to the legality of RingGo’s policies.Ann RunacresUllenhall, WarwickshireScotland’s prideSIR – As an Englishman, I am happy to record that Scottish football support has no equal (Sport, June 20). When the fans paraded through Cologne, led by 20 or so pipers, it was an exhilarating sight. We should all wish them well.Herbert ChappellWoking, SurreySIR – I have no interest in football, but am surrounded by it. It never ceases, with the European Championship all summer and the English season from August to June the following year.   At school in the 1950s, I was forced to play football, and spent afternoons shivering as a goalkeeper. My best chum was Oliver Reed, the late actor, and like me he often prayed for rain and match abandonment. If this happened, we would take ourselves off to the cinema in Epsom, where in later life he appeared on screen.Charles JamesBognor Regis, West SussexTaste in booksSIR – In 1976 I caused great hilarity at my town library by returning a book chewed by my spaniel (Letters, June 20). The book was Gundogs: Training and Field Trials by Peter Moxon.The librarian allowed me to keep the book, having paid the 80-pence fine. I have it to this day.Christopher AllenSwettenham, CheshireSIR – I was a librarian for 37 years. One day a reader came with a bag full of paper and card strips that had once been a book. He said he’d put it on a conveyor at the local bakery as the lunch break was ending. The conveyor was turned on, and the book went through the bread slicer set on thick. Richard WallerWigan, LancashireEducation prioritiesSIR – There have been many letters objecting to Labour’s plan to charge VAT on private school fees.I have no objection to parents paying for private education, and realise that, for some of them, an increase in costs will necessitate hard decisions. Overall, however, this issue will affect a small proportion of pupils. Meanwhile, the Government has failed to improve the standard of education for the 93 per cent of pupils in the state system. There is a shortage of teachers, staff are leaving because of dismal working conditions, buildings are in poor repair and promised new schools have not materialised. Surely these problems are of greater concern.Alan LloydLiverpoolSIR – Michael Deacon’s article (Features, June 20) reminded me of Anthony Crosland, the privately educated Labour education secretary from 1965 to 1967, who said: “If it’s the last thing I do, I’m going to destroy every last f------ grammar school.” He almost succeeded, and since then Oxford, Cambridge and other Russell Group universities have had to tweak their admissions criteria to promote “diversity and inclusion”. Labour’s measures levelled down opportunities for the children of relatively less well-off parents. Half a century later, they may have the same effect again.Philip CorpSalisbury, WiltshireSIR – As a young journalist in Edinburgh, my father was reporting on the run-up to the election of 1964.On passing a fruit machine in the Edinburgh Press Club, he lent a few coins to the soon-to-be prime minister Harold Wilson (Letters, June 20), then watched scornfully as Wilson pocketed his paltry winnings without repaying the initial stake. The Labour Party hasn’t changed much since.Christine KennedyGreenock, RenfrewshireFixing the fridgeSIR – I have a better remedy for Celia Walden’s broken fridge drawer (Features, June 18). These are made from brittle plastic that splits easily; superglue offers only a temporary fix. Instead, take some staples, a small kitchen blowtorch and a pair of pliers. Grasp the staple with the pliers and heat it until it glows red, then press it flat over the split and push into the plastic, making a line of staples along the length of the split. The result may not be invisible, but it is effective.Kate BoydellUgborough, DevonA French cinema classic that never gets oldAnouk Aimee and Pierre Barouh on the set of the 1966 film Un homme et une femme - Giancarlo BOTTISIR – I was saddened to read Anouk Aimée’s obituary (June 19). The film Un homme et une femme made a great impact on me in the 1960s.It had a magnificent musical score by Francis Lai, which I still play at home.

Her subsequent NHS referral to an orthopaedic surgeon took more than a year. He referred her to the pain clinic, which took another six months. In February, she was put on the waiting list for an X-ray-guided injection. No date has been given. The NHS website says there is a 44-week waiting list. A phone call to the clinic is answered by a recorded message saying that the east and west divisions are being amalgamated to streamline the service. Our GP wrote but received no reply.My wife’s mobility has deteriorated so far that she is now in a wheelchair and needs mobility aids. We’ve had to put in a shower conversion and a stair climber, and get extra carers – the cost of which must far exceed that of an injection.We’ve now resorted to a private appointment next month. David LeechBalcombe, West SussexSIR – My 95-year-old mother-in-law was referred to the day unit at a major hospital in Wales. After preliminary tests she was required to stay overnight for observation. The wait for a bed on a hard plastic chair in reception lasted some 14 hours, until, at 2am, a trolley was found and put in an emergency ward. A bed was never allocated, and other patients also waiting for beds were still in reception at 7am. When challenged about the availability of a bed, a member of the medical staff said that “this was the current state of the health service in Wales”.My message to those living in England is: be careful what you wish for when voting Labour.Trevor GallCarmarthenLetters to the EditorWe accept letters by email and post.

358,"UK voters will head to the polls to elect the next prime minister in two weeks' time on 4 July.Political parties have been busy campaigning following the snap election announcement by Rishi Sunak, who revealed the vote would be held on Thursday 4 July.The Conservatives are currently trailing Labour by a significant margin in the polls, with the latest polling figures showing Labour projected to potentially secure a record number of MPs and the Sunak himself in danger of losing his seat, which would make him the first sitting prime minister to do so.Other high-profile Tory MPs - including Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Liz Truss - are also facing the prospect of being ousted by voters.Some tactical voting campaigners are eager to make this a reality - with the Conservatives (as the sitting party in government) the most likely to be on the sharp end of such initiatives.Indeed, the Best for Britain campaign group says it wants to inflict the “heaviest possible election defeat” on the Conservatives. It believes that its GetVoting.org initiative could help oust several prominent Tories, including Sunak and Hunt.What is tactical voting?Tactical voting is when someone chooses to vote for a candidate who would not be their first choice, or perhaps a candidate they would not even have considered voting for previously.The idea is that by voting for that candidate, you are doing your bit to stop another candidate winning.It tends to apply in constituencies where two candidates are close in numbers, and significantly out in front of their opponents.Some voters employ tactical voting as a strategy to counter the UK's 'First Past The Post' (FPTP) voting system, where a candidate with the most votes wins.This can result in an MP being elected even though the majority of voters supported candidates from a different political spectrum.For example, a Conservative candidate may win in their local constituency if the vote is divided between left-wing candidates from the Labour and Green Party.Voters will head to the [polls on 4 July. (Getty)How does tactical voting work?A scenario where tactical voting could come into play is when a voter’s preferred candidate is likely to come third with no realistic chance of winning.In this case, the voter could vote tactically by choosing to vote for one of the two candidates who will win the seat.John Boken, a 43-year-old secondary school teacher from Oswestry, is one of millions of registered voters who is preparing to cast his vote for a party that is not his top preference.Despite his inclination towards Labour, Boken feels he has to support the Liberal Democrats to prevent the Conservative candidate from securing the seat in his constituency.An example of tactical voting in action would be a traditional Labour voter who voted for Brexit in 2016 opting to vote for the Conservative candidate in their constituency in the hope of getting a Tory majority and avoiding a hung parliament which they may fear would lead to a second EU referendum.On the other hand, a traditional Tory voter who wants the UK to remain in the EU could lend their vote to the Labour or Lib Dem candidates in a bid to avoid a Conservative majority government.Meanwhile, back in 1997, tactical voting group Get Rid of Them (Grot) targeted 90 seats across the country where tactical voting could secure the defeat of the Tory candidate.And in 2017, the then Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron called on traditional Tory and Labour supporters to vote tactically to bring Conservative numbers down.The argument against tactical votingOne problem with this approach, some argue, is that you end up with a situation where a voter is choosing a candidate who's policies they may disagree with.The Electoral Reform Society, a campaign group opposed to the first-past-the-post system, says switching to some form of proportional representation (PR) would remove the need for tactical voting.Such a system would see, for example, a party that receives one-third of the vote expecting to gain one-third of the seats in parliament.They say this would remove much of the impetus for voters to try and hack their way around the current system.In a blog post on the group's website in 2022, Willie Sullivan wrote: ""No voter should have to vote tactically. But tactical voting is an inevitable symptom of our failing first-past-the-post system used for Westminster elections.""As voters are given just one preference and only one candidate can become the MP in each constituency, votes for all the other candidates go to waste. This all-or-nothing system means that voters have to choose between voting with their hearts or working around the system to get the best outcome in their area.""This kind of voter behaviour is ... sadly a symptom of our electoral system anytime votes head to the polls. The 2019 general election was the most recent example of a ‘hold your nose’ election – where millions of voters were forced to vote for the ‘least worst option.""Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

367,"When Rishi Sunak, Britain’s Conservative prime minister, called a snap election in the pouring rain last month, he would have hoped his party would have closed at least some of the 20-point deficit in the opinion polls.Instead, it seems the only members of his party who have profited since are some of his Downing street aides – in a political betting scandal that has swiftly reinforced prevailing anti-Conservative stereotypes in the British public’s imagination.A week ago, the Guardian revealed that Craig Williams, Rishi Sunak’s parliamentary private secretary, an otherwise obscure politician with an intimate knowledge of Downing Street, had placed a £100 bet on his boss calling an early general election in July.The odds were 5-1, hardly enough to be worth risking a reputation over. But even though Williams stood to gain only £500, he thought it worth placing a bet on Sunday 19 May with a rural Welsh bookmaker.Three days later, a rain-soaked Sunak made his surprise announcement, asking the British public on 22 May: “Who do you trust?” Before that Wednesday morning, few had expected an election to be called before the summer.Williams’ bet raised the question of whether word of the prime minister’s plan had spread and he was relying on inside information, and the industry’s regulator, the Gambling Commission, began an inquiry. Betting on an event of which you already know the outcome is illegal in English and Welsh law.However, it was a question the gilet-wearing Williams studiously avoided when the BBC caught up with him on the street the day after. “I’m not expanding, because it is an independent process,” Williams said as the television cameras followed him, although he was willing to admit the bet was “a huge error of judgment”.Political scandals in Britain do not have to involve large sums of money, but they linger in the public imagination if they feel politicians have been acting with impunity. Fifteen years ago, dozens of MPs were forced out after an expenses scandal. One Conservative quit after asking taxpayers to pay £1,645 for an ornamental duck house.More pertinently, Sunak’s predecessor as prime minister but one, Boris Johnson, was forced out of office two years ago over another scandal: the “Partygate” affair.Johnson, aides and advisers, it emerged, had held a string of parties and drinks events in Downing Street during the coronavirus crisis, at times when the British public were forced to remain at home, unable even to visit sick or dying relatives.The Gambling Commission has widened its investigation, looking at last-minute bets on a July election where anybody stood to gain more than the relatively modest sum of £199. Other data already suggested that several gamblers were making last-minute online bets on a surprise July election.A Guardian analysis shows that a sudden flood of bets on a July election was placed on Tuesday 21 May on the Betfair Exchange, before Sunak had even told his own cabinet of senior politicians that the early election was going ahead.Between January and May, an average of £27 a day was gambled on Sunak calling a general election in July, and most people bet just a few pounds on what was seen as an unlikely outcome.Then, the day before Sunak’s announcement, a total £3,285 was gambled on Betfair in dozens of bets. Some punters stuck on hundreds of pounds, suggesting serious confidence and driving the odds down.Although the data came from only one specialist online bookmaker, it immediately suggested the scale of bets across the whole industry may have been more substantial – as the Gambling Commission’s own inquiries appear to be bearing out.On Monday, a police bodyguard, whose job it was to protect Sunak from terror attacks and other physical threats, was arrested after allegedly placing a bet on the timing of the election. Then on Thursday, it emerged that two more Conservatives might be involved.Laura Saunders, the party’s candidate in Bristol North West, was under scrutiny over an election day bet, the BBC revealed. Her husband, Tony Lee, the party’s director of campaigns, was immediately placed on leave of absence, and the Conservatives were forced to admit that “a small number of individuals” were being investigated.Britain’s opposition Labour party, already firm favourites for a landslide victory, barely had to say anything, although one party spokesperson leaned into the idea that the affair reflected a Conservative sense of entitlement.Pat McFadden, the party’s national campaign coordinator, said he did not understand why it was only the police officer that had been suspended: “This looks as if there is one rule for members of the Tory [Conservative] party, and another rule for everybody else.”","Whatever the sums involved, the election betting scandal will linger in public’s minds",11,8
196,"Rishi Sunak has indicated that young people might face restrictions on access to finance or driving licences if they refuse to do national service, as he faced a TV quizzing from voters.Asked during a BBC Question Time special what sanctions people could face for declining to take part in the Conservative policy of compulsory national service for all 18-year-olds, the prime minister pointed to “driving licences, or the access to finance, all sorts of other things”.Questioned on whether this could mean denying young people bank cards, he replied: “There’s lot of different models around Europe.”In his half-hour slot on the show, following Keir Starmer, Ed Davey and John Swinney, the Labour, Liberal Democrat and Scottish National party leaders, Sunak was also repeatedly challenged on why the public should trust the Tories after 14 sometimes chaotic years in office.He received shouts of “shame” after refusing to say he would keep Britain in the European convention on human rights.He was also challenged on revelations about alleged betting on the general election date, saying he was “incredibly angry” about the issue. .The prime minister was asked why Brexit was “absent” from the current Conservative manifesto, a question which prompted applause from the audience in York.Pressed on NHS waiting lists, he conceded that the government “haven’t made as much progress as I would like” but insisted things were improving. Asked if this had convinced him, the questioner replied: “No.” Another audience member, a doctor, then attacked Sunak over his NHS plans, saying: “People are suffering.”The sceptical tone was set by the first question to Sunak, which noted the quick succession of five Tory prime ministers, including Liz Truss’s six weeks in office: “I am asking if you would confess to us tonight even just a small amount of embarrassment to be leading the Conservative party?”Sunak insisted people should judge him on his own record, but was then asked why young people should trust him given the “shenanigans with the Tory party”. Fiona Bruce, hosting the show, said: “There’s a bit of a theme emerging.”In his half-hour slot before Sunak’s, Starmer was also asked a series of tricky questions, with one audience member calling out “all of the backtracking on policies from Labour”.Starmer gave a bullish response, saying tough decisions were needed, characterising one as being between reducing NHS waiting lists and removing student tuition fees.“They are political choices,” he said, calling himself “a commonsense politician” and adding: “I’m telling you what they are before the election, so people can make their mind up.”The Labour leader faced a grilling over whether he was being sincere when he praised Jeremy Corbyn during the 2019 election as someone who would make a “great” prime minister.After deflecting the question by saying he did not expect Labour to win in 2019, as he has done before, Starmer said: “I was campaigning for the Labour party, I was a Labour politician.”Pressed by Bruce for a yes or no answer about whether he meant it, Starmer indicated he believed Corbyn would have been better than his Conservative opponent, saying: “Look what we got – Boris Johnson.”Asked about transgender rights and differences within the Labour party over the issue, Starmer stressed that he wanted to bring the public together on divisive issues. He contrasted this with Sunak’s decision to make a “trans joke” in parliament, winning applause.Davey, the first leader to be grilled, faced audience opprobrium over his party’s role in the 2010-15 coalition government, with one audience member winning applause by accusing the Lib Dem leader of having “enabled Cameron’s and Osborne’s austerity”.Another questioner prompted applause by asking how young people could trust the Lib Dems when they had broken a pledge over introducing tuition fees.Davey conceded that he was “not proud” of some of the policies enacted, saying that one lesson he had learned from the coalition period was that in 2010 his party “promised what we couldn’t deliver”.Similarly, Swinney was asked about the succession of recent scandals for his party, with one questioner saying it had “destroyed itself from the top down”. The SNP leader said he realised his party had to “rebuild the trust of people in Scotland”.He was also pressed on whether the SNP would continue to push for independence if it did not achieve a majority of Scottish Westminster seats, a question he somewhat dodged.",Rishi Sunak floats sanctions on young people for refusing national service,11,8
269,"Sir Keir Starmer has said that Jeremy Corbyn would have made a better prime minister than Boris Johnson.The Labour leader made the comment in a special BBC Question Time programme in which he was pinned down over his past support for Mr Corbyn.Sir Keir first refused five times to stand by his comment made in the run up to the 2019 election that Mr Corbyn, his predecessor as Labour leader, would have made a “great prime minister”.But he eventually said: “He would be a better prime minister… look what we got, Boris Johnson, a man who made massive promises, didn’t keep them, and then had to leave parliament in disgrace.”The comment is eye-catching since Sir Keir has in recent years repeatedly distanced himself from Mr Corbyn, a Left-winger who has since been forced out of the Labour Party. Mr Corbyn is standing as an independent candidate at this election.During the BBC programme, the Labour leader, who was booed as he entered the studio, claimed that too many homeowners were ‘ripping off’ their tenants. and he said they would be banned by law from accepting the highest offer of rent from potential tenants after “bidding wars”.Sir Keir said that landlords would not be allowed to go back and forth between potential tenants getting final offers, driving up the rent.He said that legislation would be tabled to bring about the change if Labour wins office, meaning that the new rules would be legally enforceable.However, repeatedly pressed by Fiona Bruce, the BBC presenter, about how exactly the plan would work he gave few other details.Sir Keir said: “We have to stop the landlords ripping off tenants who are doing this bidding war: who’ll pay more until people are paying through the roof. We have to end that.“We can pass legislation to say you can’t do it because it’s driving rents through the roof and it’s not fair. It’s taking advantage.”On Thursday night, four political leaders were each grilled for 30 minutes on the BBC programme: Sir Keir, Rishi Sunak, Sir Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, and John Swinney, the SNP leader.The Labour leader was also pinned down on the change in his position on trans issues, and faced criticism over his plans to apply VAT on private school fees.Describing his desire to bring in a law on how landlords can act in the rental market, Sir Keir said: “We can’t have this bidding war like this. We have to have a scheme in place to stop them driving rents up and up. Lots of renters are paying huge deposits and we have to stop that as well.”The Labour leader said that a landlord would not be able to get a final offer on rent from one possible tenant, then go to a second and ask them to bid something higher, and so on.The aim is to stop landlords from bounding tenants off each other in a way that artificially raises rents. But the full details of how the policy would work remains unclear.Sir Keir was challenged on his past support for Mr Corbyn, the Left-wing Labour leader for the 2017 and 2019 election who has been forced out of the party.At one point Bruce asked Sir Keir to answer “yes or no” whether he was telling the truth when saying in the past that in 2019 Mr Corbyn would make a “great prime minister”.Sir Keir did not give a yes-no answer and the audience laughed. He defended his past position by saying: “In 2019 I campaigned for the Labour Party as I’ve always campaigned for the Labour Party. I wanted good colleagues returned to parliament.”Sir Keir also, after repeated pressing, admitted that NHS waiting lists may not return to normal years until five years into a Labour government.The Labour leader at first declined to answer when asked at what time the public could know they would get an NHS appointment in under a month.Sir Keir said “we will start the work on waiting lists on day one in government”, and later “we will get those operations going as quickly as we can with staff”.Asked again for specifics, Sir Keir said the NHS backlogs would be brought down “over the course of the parliament”. A parliament lasts five years, which would mean 2029.The Labour leader was pressed on his about-turns in policy. Sir Keir has been criticised for ditching many of the 10 pledges that he named in the 2020 Labour leadership contest.Sir Keir insisted he was a “commonsense politician”, arguing he had abandoned his plans to nationalise energy firms after concluding it would be too costly and not bring bills down.No figure on migrationOn immigration, a policy area that the Tories have criticised Labour on for not being tough enough, Sir Keir said he wanted net migration to fall but refused to put a figure on it.Sir Keir said: “Migration is at record levels under this Government. They’ve completely lost control. We need to get that number down. We need to get it significantly down“I’m not going to put an arbitrary figure on it because every single politician who as put a number on it has never met that number“We need to get it down.. We want to get it down significantly – it needs to be balanced migration. The problem is we haven’t got the skills in this country.”The Labour leader was also challenged on his past comments about trans issues. Sir Keir once said that 99.9 per cent of women “haven’t got a penis”.But Sir Keir outlined a more absolute stance on the BBC, saying: “On the biology, I agree with what Tony Blair said in relation to men having penises and women having vaginas.“That doesn’t help on the gender. There are some people who don’t identify with the gender that they are born into and they go through a lot of anxiety and distress.“My view in life is to respect and give dignity to everyone.I was worried by the way in which the debate was being conducted: it got very toxic… and we lost sight of people in that.”",Starmer: Corbyn would have made better prime minister than Johnson,11,11
64,"From Rishi Sunak, we saw the good, the bad and the ugly during the latest TV election showdown with other party leaders - and a tough and unforgiving audience.The good came when he broke his silence on the Tory betting scandal early on in his half-hour session of questions, declaring he was ""incredibly angry"" and vowing that any law breakers would be ""booted out"" of his party.The bad followed when he struggled to defend his own policy on national service for 18-year-olds and was tetchy with an audience member who asked about Brexit.And the ugly came at the end when the audience angrily shouted ""shame!"" when he launched into Reform UK-style rhetoric about the European Convention on Human Rights and attacked what he called a ""foreign court"".That sort of talk may play well with right-wing MPs and activists, but it bombed here and will have alienated those voters thinking of switching to Labour or the Liberal Democrats.So Mr Sunak started well, got bogged down in detail in the middle and then ended badly, though he eventually did manage to land some blows on Labour on tax - as he has continued to do so throughout the election campaign.The two takeaways from the PM's part of this election programme will be his threat to expel betting wrongdoers and his misjudging the audience on the ECHR.But not surprisingly, that wasn't good enough for opposition MPs.Immediately after the programme, Labour's Jonathan Ashworth told Sky News Mr Sunak still has not taken any action against Tory candidates Craig Williams and Laura Saunders, who are being investigated by the Gambling Commission.He should have suspended them immediately, as Sir Keir Starmer has demanded, Mr Ashworth said.But despite the shouts of ""shame!"" from the audience on the ECHR near the end, Mr Sunak will feel that with the Tories losing votes to Nigel Farage he had to throw the Tory right and would-be Reform UK voters some red meat.Those Tory MPs who love to hate the ECHR will no doubt have approved of Mr Sunak's attack as far as it went - and no doubt accuse the BBC of selecting a ""lefty"" audience.Before Mr Sunak, Sir Keir stumbled once again, as he did in his interview with Beth Rigby in last week's Sky News Battle for No 10 programme in Grimsby, when asked about his support for Jeremy Corbyn.Host Fiona Bruce repeatedly challenged Sir Keir on why he said Mr Corbyn would make a great prime minister in 2019, but the Labour leader kept dodging the question and looked shifty.Eventually, Sir Keir said, rather lamely, that Mr Corbyn would have made a better prime minister than Boris Johnson.Tories will no doubt taunt him on that claim for the rest of the campaign.Sir Keir's other tricky moments came when he was quizzed about his dispute with Labour MP Rosie Duffield on trans issues.""I agree with Tony Blair,"" he said. But he shunned the Canterbury MP and couldn't bring himself to mention her name.That was disrespectful. The Labour leader seems to have a problem with Ms Duffield. It makes him sound intolerant, which his critics would say is fair criticism.The surprise here was a solid performance from the SNP leader John Swinney. He is less confrontational than the party's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn.He has a funereal style of delivery that has previously seen him compared to an undertaker.He could also be compared to a Church of Scotland priest reading from the prayer book, to be fair.But he's an old pro and a details man, as he demonstrated when answering tricky questions about the SNP performance on the NHS in Scotland and was courteous with members of the audience, even when the questions were tough.It all began with Sir Ed Davey, who was immediately greeted with the question: ""Aren't you going to bankrupt the country?""""No,"" he replied.Well, it would have been a shock if he'd said yes.Read more:Labour vows to end rental 'bidding wars'Green co-leader rejects Liz Truss comparisonFormer Tory minister says he'll vote LabourThe second questioner was applauded after he accused Sir Ed of breaking promises in coalition government, citing the Lib Dems' U-turn on tuition fees.He was also ridiculed by a member of the audience over his ""horseplay"" in the campaign, the stunts such as splashing around on Lake Windemere and riding on a rollercoaster at Thorpe Park in Surrey.And inevitably, he was asked if he was proud of his record as Post Office minister during the Horizon scandal.The questions were tough, but he dealt with them calmly. His style was that of a fireside chat.With four party leaders competing this was a game of four quarters.And this tough and unforgiving audience gave the leaders no quarter.","It was the good, the bad and the ugly for Rishi Sunak during the latest TV election showdown",11,5
181,"Rishi Sunak confessed to being “incredibly angry” over members of his inner circle being caught up in a gambling scandal over bets on the date of the election.But, as the prime minister faced a BBC Question Time audience with just two weeks of the election to go, he refused to suspend two candidates currently being investigated by the Gambling Commission.With polls still pointing to a massive Labour majority and a Tory wipeout with many voters defecting to Reform, Mr Sunak needed his half-hour slot in the debate to be a platform to turn things around in the closing stages of the election campaign.Instead he was confronted by the betting scandal which saw his director of campaigning Tony Lee “take a leave of absence”. Meanwhile, Mr Lee’s wife Laura Saunders, a candidate in Bristol who has worked for the party since 2015, and Craig Williams, his parliamentary private secretary, are all being investigated for placing bets just before Mr Sunak called his surprise snap election.Keir Starmer was asked about his previous comments on Jeremy Corbyn (PA)A tired and tense looking Mr Sunak looked exasperated as he was confronted with hostile questions on his own performance during the campaign, the scandal and other issues.At the end of his 30 minutes he managed to attack members of the audience and was booed and catcalled with cries of “shame” over his promise to quit the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) if it prevented him from protecting the UK’s borders on migration.He told the Question Time audience: “It was the right moment to call the election, for the reasons that I have outlined.”Asked if he was glad to have called the election, he added: “I am.”The prime minister, who attacked his predecessors Boris Johnson and Liz Truss several times, compared his current prospects to those he had during the Tory leadership contest of 2022 against Ms Truss.In a defiant note on why he would not give up even with the polls stacked against him, Mr Sunak said: “Even though people didn’t want to hear it at the time, I kept going, I kept saying what I thought was right for this country, I kept going until the end and you know what? I was proved right then.“And that is why you can trust me now when I say that what Keir Stammer is promising you is the same fantasy as Liz Truss did and it is just going to make your taxes go up and that matters to me because I don’t want that to happen.”A tense Sunak answers questions from the audience (PA)Mr Sunak, who was a Leave supporter in 2016, also defended Brexit. Asked if Brexit had denied young people a future, he said “we had a referendum, it’s time to get on”.He said it is time to “make sure we realise all the benefits” of Brexit.Earlier, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer was challenged on the number of U-turns he has made and his integrity as a politician.He was challenged over his previous support for Jeremy Corbyn and claims that he would make a great prime minister, which saw Sir Keir again try distance himself from his recent past.The Labour leader said: “I am a common sense politician. I work through the issues and to me it did not make sense to nationalise energy and not get the bills down, so I decided we would go for getting the bills down.”However, he refused to give a number or time frame for his pledge in bringing migration down.He was also challenged on his treatment of Canterbury Labour candidate Rosie Duffield, who has been marginalised over her belief in protecting female biological rights.Quizzed about his views on the definition of a woman, Sir Keir said he agreed with Sir Tony Blair’s recent comment that a woman has a vagina and a man has a penis.Sir Keir said: “There are many people who don’t identify with the gender they are born into.”The Labour leader said he wanted to “give dignity to everyone” and criticised Mr Sunak for a trans jibe allegedly linked to Brianna Ghey.“I want to bring the country together,” he added, “during the pandemic people were looking out for each other.”The first two up before the audience were Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey and SNP leader John Swinney.Mr Davey faced tough questions about his record in the coalition years and as minister in the Horizon scandal, as grilling of the four main party leaders by members of the public kicked off.Challenged by a student over the Lib Dems abandoning their pledge to scrap tuition fees in the coalition government, Sir Ed said: “I understand why your generation lost faith in us. It was a difficult government to be in.”He said the loss of trust in his party after that period was “very scarring” and admitted he was “not proud” of some of the votes he had to take part in.In the SNP leader’s session Fiona Bruce repeatedly challenged Mr Swinney on what it would mean for his democratic mandate for independence if the SNP failed to win a majority of Scottish seats in July given, she suggested, it would be a “democratic decision that you shouldn’t be pursuing independence”.When he repeated that he wanted people in Scotland to confidently vote for the SNP so the party could turn its manifesto into reality, she voiced her conclusion that he was not going to answer the question.He was also asked why the SNP had backtracked on its opposition to new oil and gas licences, and he said that while the need to transition to net zero was “absolutely inescapable” it would be necessary to use fossil fuels “for some time to come”.",Sunak ‘incredibly angry’ over gambling scandal but refuses to suspend candidates involved,11,9
386,"Young people who refuse to do national service could forfeit their driving licences and be denied access to student loans, Rishi Sunak has suggested.The Prime Minister said there would need to be “a set of sanctions and incentives” to ensure compliance with a new scheme proposed by the Tories.When asked how he would make youngsters take part, he suggested the UK could adopt punitive measures used by other European nations.The Tories have included plans for a new national service scheme in their manifesto.Under the plans every 18-year-old would have to spend either a year in the military or the equivalent of one weekend a month in a volunteering role.Mr Sunak was pressed on how he would enforce the scheme, which the Conservatives say would be compulsory, during a leaders’ special of Question Time.He said: “You’ll have a set of sanctions and incentives and we will look at the models that are existing around Europe to get the appropriate mix of those.”Asked what that meant, he added: “There’s all sorts of things that people do across Europe, whether that’s looking at driving licences, other access to finance.”It is understood the Prime Minister was referring to schemes which mean people who refuse to do national service can face sanctions related to driving licences or student loans.Ten European states have national service - Austria, Estonia, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.Mr Sunak said that a Royal Commission would be set up to examine the best options on incentives and sanctions and report back to Government.A Tory source said such a commision would look at best practice from other comparable counties and decide on appropriate measures for the UK.He said other countries have sanctions on student finance and driving licences, and that Mr Sunak was not saying those are good for the UK.The Prime Minister was one of four main party leaders taking part in a BBC Question Time programme on Thursday night.Election date gambling rowDuring a grilling from audience members Mr Sunak was also confronted about the row over alleged betting on the election date engulfing his party.It emerged this week that a second Conservative candidate and the party’s campaigns director were being looked into by the Gambling Commission.The watchdog is examining bets allegedly placed by Laura Saunders, the Tory candidate in Bristol North West, and her husband, Tony Lee, who is now on leave of absence from his job at party headquarters.Last week the Prime Minister’s parliamentary private secretary, Tory candidate Craig Williams, apologised for placing a £100 bet that the election would be in July.Mr Sunak said that he was “incredibly angry to learn of these allegations” but refused to say that the two candidates involved should be barred by the party.He said: “All I can say is they are serious investigations. It’s right that they are done thoroughly, confidentially, the integrity of that process should be respected.“But what I can tell you is that if anyone is found to have broken the rules not only should they face the full consequences of the law but I will make sure that they are booted out of the Conservative Party.”Mr Sunak was pressed by one audience member over his plans to reduce record levels of migration, which includes a clampdown on dependents’ visas.He said that migrants made a big contribution to the UK but that “levels of migration that we have seen are too high and they need to come down”.“What we have done is say that people are going to bring family members here, they just need to be able to support them.“I think that’s reasonable because anyone who comes to this country obviously adds to the pressure on public services. That is a very common sense measure.”Mr Sunak was then grilled on whether social care staff who come to Britain from overseas should be paid more so they were able to support their families.He replied: “We have a dedicated visa for social care because we know how important it is and we need to make sure that we do get the right workers.”Mr Sunak’s appearance came at the end of a bruising week for the Tories with several polls predicting that the party was on course for an electoral wipeout.A Savanta MRP poll for The Telegraph found the party would be down to little more than 50 seats, with more than 20 Cabinet ministers losing their seats.In that scenario even Mr Sunak would be kicked out of office, becoming the first ever sitting prime minister to lose their seat in an election.Mr Sunak told the BBC Question Time audience he believed he had chosen the right moment to call the General Election.“It was the right moment to call the election, for the reasons that I have outlined.”Asked if he was glad to have called the election, he added: “I am.”10:50 PM BSTThat’s all for this evening...Thank you for following The Telegraph’s liveblog coverage of the BBC Question Time election special.My colleague Jack Maidment will be back tomorrow morning to bring you the latest.10:46 PM BSTSir David Davis: I am angry about allegations of election date bettingSir David Davis said he was “angry” about allegations that Tory figures placed bets on the date of the general election.“Like the Prime Minister, I’m angry about it. I mean, look, it’s in the middle of a criminal investigation. So the Prime Minister is quite right not to step into it.“I’m disappointed and if it’s true it’ll be a disgrace. But we’ve got to wait.”The former Brexit secretary added he was not worried about the threat of Reform in the polls, saying the polls have been wrong at “every single” election he has taken part in.10:33 PM BSTPM was at ‘the top of his game’ says ministerThe Prime Minister was at “the top of his game” during the BBC Question Time leaders’ special, a minister has said.Bim Afolami, the economic secretary to the Treasury, told Sky News: “I don’t think it was the difficult night. I think the Prime Minister performed incredibly well.“I think that yes, you’re right that the news of the day was difficult, but look at the performance the Prime Minister turned out.“It was strong, resolute, decisive, clear. At times he was willing to do that thing that people like you will say politicians don’t do which is challenge the audience, say where he disagreed.“And actually, what I heard at the end was an audience that saw a guy, a Prime Minister, at the top of his game, serious and understanding the challenges the country faces.”10:33 PM BSTStarmer ‘will say just what he thinks you want to hear’ say ToriesSir Keir Starmer “will say just what he thinks you want to hear”, the Tories have said.A spokesman for the Conservative Party said: “It was clear from the debate tonight that Keir Starmer will say just what he thinks you want to hear.“What he didn’t say is that his tax trap manifesto does not add up and he is planning to raise tax. Raise council tax, impose the Retirement tax and tax the family home, this will cost hard working families at least £2,094.“A vote for anyone other than the Conservatives will hand Starmer a super majority to raise your taxes and rig our elections for a generation.”10:29 PM BSTTory minister sets out election dividing linesKevin Hollinrake, a business minister, said the key dividing lines between Labour and the Conservatives were tax and migration.Mr Hollinrake told reporters: “People can choose between lower taxes and lower migration under a Conservative government or higher taxes and higher migration under Labour.”“He’s been very clear these are very difficult decisions to potentially exclude ourselves from parts of the ECHR, and not let the European Court in Strasbourg stop us doing what we need to in terms of controlling legal migration.“We should be clear that we are going to tackle this issue, whatever the resistance in parliament and whatever resistance in other parts of our society, because it’s the right thing to do.”10:26 PM BST‘Cynicism is a big challenge’ for Labour, says Streeting“Cynicism is a big challenge” for Labour despite projections of a landslide election victory, Wes Streeting has said.The shadow health secretary said the scandal over bets placed on the date of the general election was an example of the “Conservative clown show continuing”.He told reporters: “So many lifelong Conservative voters that I’ve been speaking to over the last four weeks are now looking to Labour as the alternative and our challenge in the next fortnight is to persuade people that politics can make a difference, that voting can change things.“We’re not inhaling the polls. We know that. You know, cynicism is a big challenge and the Conservative Party’s message to Labour supporters is put your feet up, stay at home. There’s no need to vote for change because Labour’s going to be in government anyway. We know that.“You know, elections are hard and there are still millions upon millions of votes to be cast in this election. Anything can happen.

If he was truly angry about this scandal these Conservative candidates would have been suspended.“He is more interested in taking away young people’s bank accounts if they don’t do National Service than investing in their education.She added: “From a flatlining economy to an NHS on its knees, his performance showed why we cannot let Rishi Sunak and the Conservative Party gamble with our country’s future again.”10:11 PM BSTRishi Sunak’s performance was ‘abject failure’ say LabourRishi Sunak faces questions on the general election betting scandal from Labour in the aftermath to the Question Time special.Pat McFadden, Labour’s campaign coordinator, described the Prime Minister’s performance as an “abject failure”.He added: “On the candidates involved in the insider betting scandal, does he think they would be good MPs? Will he campaign for them? Does he want his cabinet colleagues to campaign for them? Does he think they are fit to hold office as Ministers? How many more Tory politicians or officials are involved in this?“When he became leader after the Liz Truss disaster he had a chance to change his party. He flunked it.

But when you’re dealing with six million missed referrals that we are now catching up on it is going to take time to get them down.”Answering a question from an NHS worker, he said: “I absolutely acknowledge your concerns. You and your colleagues are working very hard.“You’re doing more than we’ve ever done before, but the situation is challenging, because we are dealing with the backlog of missed appointments that you are very well aware of, and I’m sure you were working hard during Covid.

It’s a really serious matter. It’s right that they’re being investigated properly by the relevant law enforcement authorities, including, as Fiona said, a criminal investigation by the police.“I want to be crystal clear that if anyone has broken the rules, they should face the full force of the law, and that’s what those investigations are there to do, and I hope that they do their work as quickly and as thoroughly as possible.”He added: “What I can tell you is if anyone is found to have broken the rules, not only should they face the full consequences of the law, I will make sure that they are booted out of the Conservative Party.”09:39 PM BSTSunak fails to say what sanctions would be in place for those who refused national serviceRishi Sunak has failed to say what kind of sanctions would be in place for young people who refused to do national service.Asked how it would be made compulsory, the Prime Minister said: “You’ll have a set of sanctions, and incentives, and we will look at the models that are existing around Europe for the appropriate mix of those.”Asked for examples, Mr Sunak said: “There’s all sorts of things across Europe, whether that’s looking at driving licenses, other access to finance, all sorts of other things.”Pressed on what that meant, the Prime Minister said: “There’s a range of things, and we will have a Royal Commission look at all of those, come back to the government and recommend what the appropriate mix of incentives and sanctions is.”09:32 PM BSTSunak asked whether he feels any ‘embarrassment’ over leading ToriesRishi Sunak immediately came under fire after the first question put to him was whether he felt any “embarrassment” over leading the Conservatives after seven prime ministers.He told Question Time: “When I first got this job, I stood on the steps of Downing Street and spoke to all of you as prime minister for the first time, and I acknowledge that.“I said very clearly that mistakes had been made, and that’s why I was standing there in front of you. In fact, you may remember I spent the summer before that arguing against the policies that my predecessor had suggested were right.“I didn’t think they were right for the country, and I said so. But what I’d ask you to do is judge me on my 18 months that I’ve been in office. I came in with one primary job, and that was to bring back economic stability after the difficult few years that we’ve had.”09:29 PM BSTStarmer: I am a common sense politicianSir Keir Starmer claimed he was a “common sense politician” when asked why he had not kept a promise to abolish university tuition fees.Asked why he had backtracked on the pledge, the Labour leader told the Question Time audience: “We don’t have the money to do everything we want to do. We do want to change the tuition fees.“But I have a choice to make, which was of the available money do I use it for getting rid of the tuition fees… or do I use that money to get our waiting lists down? That is a political decision and I took it.“I am not going to do the tuition fees abolition, because I want to put that money to get our NHS back on its feet.”Sir Keir also said he chose Labour’s plan for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies over nationalising energy companies, as the latter would require huge amounts of money to “pay off the shareholders”.The Labour leader said: “I am a common sense politician. I work through the issues and to me it did not make sense to nationalise energy and not get the bills down, so I decided we would go for getting the bills down.”09:29 PM BSTStarmer defends private schools VAT policySir Keir Starmer has defended his VAT policy on private schools, saying that “all parents are aspirational for their children”.He told Question Time: “Look on private schools, I completely understand that families up and down the country work hard and save hard to send their children to private school because they’re aspirational for their children, but all parents are aspirational for their children.”“Every single parent, every single child, wherever they come from, whatever their background and whichever school they go to, (should) have the same opportunities.”09:25 PM BSTReaders’ views on how Sir Keir Starmer is doing on Question Time09:23 PM BSTStarmer challenged on his views on genderSir Keir Starmer has been challenged on his views over trans issues.Asked about his historic views on gender, the Labour leader said: “Look on the biology.

And my view in life is to respect and give dignity to everyone, whatever their position and I will always do that.”Sir Keir said: “I was worried at the time... by the way in which the debate was being conducted, because it got very toxic, very divided, very hard line, and we lost sight of people in that, so much so that that drags you to a place where we end up, as we did,  with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom making a trans joke in Parliament when the mother of a murder trans teenager was watching out, that is a shocking place to get to.”09:15 PM BSTWatch: Sir Ed Davey refuses to rule out entering coalition09:12 PM BSTOur plans to get NHS waiting lists down is ‘an ask of staff’ says StarmerOur policy plan to cut the waiting lists is “an ask of staff” in the NHS, Sir Keir Starmer has said.Asked by a nurse on Question Time how he’d tackle the crisis in the NHS, he said: “The first thing I’d say is we would treat you with respect.And I say that because we have a Prime Minister who, 18 months or so ago said, ‘I’m going to get the waiting list down’, and he said, ‘hold me personally responsible’.And now he hasn’t gotten down because they’ve gone up… he blames you, he blames the NHS staff, we will never do that, because I know how hard you work, all of the time, in Covid in particular.He added: “We do have to take the pressure off the waiting list. Now that is an ask of staff. It is an ask of staff, I’m not going to say otherwise, because it will be working evenings and weekends to get those lists down.”You can read more about the Labour manifesto here09:05 PM BSTStarmer refuses to say whether or not he believed Corbyn would have made a good PMSir Keir Starmer has refused to say whether or not he believed Jeremy Corbyn would have been a good prime minister.Asked several times about whether he meant it when he said that Mr Corbyn would make a “great” prime minister while serving in his shadow Cabinet, Sir Keir said: “It wasn’t a question that really arose because I didn’t think we were going to win the election.”Asked again, he said: “I was campaigning for the Labor Party, and I’m glad I did.”He told Question Time: “In 2019 I campaigned for the Labor Party, as I’ve always campaigned for the Labour Party. I wanted good colleagues to be returned to Parliament. I knew we had a job and a half to do as a Labour Party because I didn’t think we were going to win that election.“Afterwards, because we got the worst results since 1935, the electorate clearly gave their verdict, we did a lot of work on how we needed to change the party.”09:01 PM BSTStarmer booed as he came onto Question Time stageSir Keir Starmer was booed as he came on stage at the BBC Question Time leader’s special.The jeers were heard immediately after host Fiona Bruce announced his name.They were briefly drowned out by the programme’s theme tune before being heard again as he stepped up to the lectern in front of the crowd.The majority of those in attendance applauded the Labour leader.08:59 PM BSTSwinney: Tories ‘can’t be out of office quick enough’John Swinney has said that it is a “racing certainty” that Labour will win the election in England, and called the Conservative Government a “total disaster and a calamity”.Asked whether Sir Keir Starmer or Rishi Sunak would be a better leader in Westminster for Scotland, Mr Swinney said: “Look, I think that the Conservative Government has been a total disaster and a calamity, so it can’t be out of office quick enough.He added: “I think it’s an absolute racing certainty that the Labour Party will win the election in England, and I hope people in Scotland will recognise the importance of having strong SNP voices in the House of Commons, who will argue for decisions to remain in Scotland for Scotland, and not put into people in Scotland first.”08:55 PM BSTSunak’s authorisation of new oil and gas licences is ‘utterly irresponsible’Rishi Sunak’s decision to authorise new oil and gas licences in the North Sea is “utterly irresponsible” and is “essentially to deny the climate emergency”, John Swinney has said.He told Question Time: “The Prime Minister has said that he would authorise 100 new oil and gas licenses. I think that’s completely and utterly irresponsible. It is essentially to deny the climate emergency, and I would have nothing to do with that.“But what I do want to make sure is that we can work with the oil and gas sector to support it in making the transition to net zero, because we will actually need lots of the skills in the oil and gas sector to be available to help us with the transition to net zero.”08:52 PM BSTBrexit means Scotland deserves a second referendum, says SwinneyBrexit caused a “very material change in circumstances that merits another referendum” on an independent Scotland, John Swinney has said.Asked whether Scotland should be able to have a referendum on rejoining the EU or the Single Market, he said: “I think it’s a very good point, because in 2016 Scotland voted emphatically to stay in the European Union.“And one of the things we were told in the 2014 independence referendum in Scotland was that our European Union membership was guaranteed by voting no to independence.He added: “Two years later, the absolute opposite of what was promised actually came to pass. So, for me, that’s a very, very material change in circumstances that merits another referendum on the question of independence, because one of the fundamental building blocks of the arguments against independence was about the continuity of EU membership.”08:46 PM BSTSwinney defends SNP recordJohn Swinney has defended the record of the SNP, after one voter asks if the party can still be trusted “after it appears the party has destroyed itself from the top down”.The SNP leader said: “Let me perhaps set out some of the things that we’ve done since we came to office.“For example, GDP per capita in Scotland, the growth of the economy has been faster in Scotland than the rest of the United Kingdom. Productivity in the Scottish economy has grown faster under the SNP government than it has in the rest of the United Kingdom.”08:43 PM BSTLib Dem team pleased with Sir Ed Davey’s performanceSave for plenty of laughter at Fiona Bruce’s joke about when he met his wife, the spin room was fairly muted as Sir Ed Davey took questions, Dominic Penna reports from York.The Liberal Democrat team here is pleased with the performance of his leader, who faced tough questioning on the Post Office Horizon scandal, tuition fees and his offer to the country.After what they admit was a deliberately silly start to the campaign, with Sir Ed grabbing headlines for a series of stunts across the country, it has taken on a more serious and sober tone since the manifesto launch.The applause enjoyed by Sir Ed when he railed against water giants over the sewage scandal suggests this quietly resolute focus on Britain’s polluted waters, as well as the social care and NHS crises, is starting to pay off.But how that plays out at the ballot box on July 4 remains anyone’s guess.08:41 PM BSTSwinney: The UK Government should let us put the question of independence to ScotlandJohn Swinney has blamed the UK Government for not allowing the SNP to put “the concept” of independence to the public.He told voters: “I honestly believe that Scotland would be a stronger country and would have better prospects if we were an independent country.“That’s been my view, my honest view, for all of my entire adult life. but I’m a democrat, so I accept that we can’t be an independent country until the people of Scotland vote for us to be an independent country. And I do believe in the right of the people of Scotland to decide their own future.”John Swinney at Question Time election specialHe added: “One of the frustrations I’ve got is that today in the Scottish Parliament, there is a majority in favour of there being a referendum on independence and that Scotland should be an independent country.“But we are not being permitted by the United Kingdom Government to put that idea and that concept to the public, and I think we should have the right to do so.”08:39 PM BSTSwinney: I may have played a part in polarisation of politicsJohn Swinney, leader of the SNP, has now taken to the stage to take questions from voters.He has said that he believes that there is a need to “bring people together” in politics, and he is “worried” about the polarisation of politics.Mr Swinney said: “One of the things that really worries me about politics today, and accept that I might actually have played a part in creating this, is the polarisation of debate.“I think there’s a need to bring people together and when I became First Minister just six and a half weeks ago, I pledged that I would reach out beyond my party to other parties, to other opinions, to try to bring people together, because I think what’s wrong with our society today, is that we’re not together.“We are polarised, and we have to bring people back together.”08:31 PM BSTWhy did you think of Sir Ed Davey’s performance?08:31 PM BSTDavey: I understand why young people lost faith in the Lib DemsSir Ed Davey said he understands why people no longer trust the Liberal Democrats after they abandoned their pledge to scrap tuition fees in the coalition years, but said his party has learned lessons.During the BBC’s Question Time special, the Liberal Democrat leader said: “I understand why your generation lost faith in us. It was a difficult government to be in.”He added: “The thing I learned from that process – the whole process, fees, but other things too – was you shouldn’t promise what you can’t deliver, and I think we did in 2010.”Asked if he’s making promises he can’t commit to in the current election campaign, Sir Ed replied: “Absolutely not. It was the big lesson I learned.”He later added that the coalition years were “very scarring”.08:30 PM BSTTories release attack ad: ‘The Lib Dems aren’t a joke’The Lib Dems aren't a joke.If you vote Lib Dem, you'll end up with Labour. #BBCQT pic.twitter.com/dqwm1gGHAj— Conservatives (@Conservatives) June 20, 202408:24 PM BSTTelegraph readers’ views on Sir Ed Davey’s performance08:23 PM BSTDavey questioned on whether Lib Dems appeal to voters in the North of EnglandThe Liberal Democrat leader has been challenged on whether or not they appeal to voters in the North of England.Sir Ed Davey told a voter from the North of England: “Well, I’m hoping that you like our manifesto and the things I’m saying tonight, there are seats in Greater Manchester that I’m really sure we can win, Hazel Grove and Cheadle in Stockport, part of Greater Manchester.“We’re looking really good to beat the Conservatives in those seats. And there are parts of the North, (I was) in Sheffield earlier today with our candidate in Sheffield Hallam, I think we can actually beat Labour there. I’m going to Harrogate tomorrow.“So there are parts of the North, but it is true that the vast majority of seats that I think we can win at this election are in the Home Counties.”08:15 PM BSTDavey questioned on whether he thinks he can become PMSir Ed Davey has been questioned on whether or not he believes he can become prime minister.Asked whether he believed he could, he said: “I’m realistic about our chances. Right, we’ve had three very bad elections… and when I became leader, I said my top priority was to defeat as many Conservative MPs as possible.”Asked again by Fiona Bruce, Sir Ed said becoming prime minister would be “challenging given the polls.”“But I don’t want to put a ceiling on our ambition”, he added.Liberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey speaking during a BBC Question Time Leaders' Special in York - Stefan Rousseau/PA08:09 PM BSTDavey defends time in coalition with the ToriesSir Ed Davey has defended his time serving in coalition with the Conservatives.Questioned about the Liberal Democrats’ credibility after serving in coalition with the Tories, Sir Ed said: “It was very difficult governing with the Conservatives, we couldn’t get everything we wanted.“You either had to stay in and fight inside the government or leave. I think the easy choice for me would be to leave, vote against it, and tour the media studios and complain. The hard choice was to stay in, roll my sleeves and really fight.”He added that he was “not proud of some of our votes” when the Liberal Democrats were in coalition.08:05 PM BSTSir Ed Davey denies he will ‘bankrupt’ the countrySir Ed Davey has been challenged on his spending plans, with the first question put to the Liberal Democrat leader asking if he was going to “bankrupt” the country.Sir Ed told Question Time: “The answer is no. We put forward a very detailed, costed manifesto, and it’s got a big health and social care package at the centre of about £9 billion and other things, for example, helping with free school meals, with cost of living, and we’ve shown how we’ll pay for everything we’ve got in that.”08:01 PM BSTSpin room hots up as Question Time beginsThe spin room here in York is already a hive of activity with journalists and broadcasters gearing up for the night ahead, writes Dominic Penna.Snacks and sandwiches have been laid on for those in attendance as party aides and MPs begin to work the room.Bim Afolami, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, and Sir David Davis, a former Brexit secretary, are among the star guests wheeled out by the Tories. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, is expected to be spinning for Labour.Many believe this election is already a foregone conclusion.

The couple are being investigated by the Gambling Commission.Ms Saunders said she ""will be co-operating with the Gambling Commission"" probe, while her husband ""took a leave of absence"" from his role on Wednesday night, a Conservative Party spokesman told Sky News.It comes a week after the prime minister's close parliamentary aide Craig Williams, the Tory candidate in Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr, admitted to putting a ""flutter"" on the election, saying this has resulted in ""some routine inquiries"" which he was co-operating with ""fully"".Mr Sunak's close protection officer has also been arrested and suspended over alleged bets about the timing of the election.A gambling industry source told Sky News that ""more names"" are being looked at, though police ""are not involved"" in those cases.Data from Betfair appears to show a flurry of bets on a July poll placed on 21 May, the day before Mr Sunak called the election - including some in the hundreds of pounds at odds that would have resulted in profits in the thousands.The prime minister was asked by an audience member, to a round of applause, if the allegations are ""the absolute epitome of the lack of ethics that we have had to tolerate from the Conservative party for years and years"".He replied: ""I was incredibly angry to learn of these allegations. It is a really serious matter.""""I want to be crystal clear that if anyone has broken the rules, they should face the full force of the law.""Quizzed over why the candidates have not been suspended while the investigations take place, Mr Sunak said the ""integrity of that process should be respected"".He added: ""What I can tell you is if anyone is found to have broken the rules, not only should they face the full consequences of the law, I will make sure that they are booted out of the Conservative Party.""Calls to suspend Tory candidatesLabour Party campaign sources told Sky News they noticed the odds on a July election narrow the day before Mr Sunak announced it on 22 May.Earlier, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for Ms Saunders to be suspended and said it is ""very telling"" Mr Sunak has not already done so.""If it was one of my candidates, they'd be gone and their feet would not have touched the floor,"" Sir Keir added.Mr Sunak faced many questions about trust during the BBC grilling, with the first audience member asking if he would ""confess to [a] small amount of embarrassment"" after having five Tory prime ministers in the last seven years and the UK becoming something of an ""international laughingstock"".The Tory leader said that ""very clearly mistakes had been made"" and asked the public to judge him on the last 18 months in office.He faced shouts of ""shame"" when he launched an attack on the ""foreign court"" - the European Court of Human Rights - and also insisted he was glad he called the election when he did despite his standing in the polls plummeting further since then.Having named the date of the election amid a 20-point deficit, the prime minister has failed to make up ground in a campaign dominated by political gaffes - notably his early exit from a D-day event.The gambling scandal was the latest blow, after multiple projections of a historic Labour landslide and a number of big figures - from a former Tory donor to a former Tory minister - announcing they would back Sir Keir for the first time ever when polling day comes around.Responding to Mr Sunak's BBC performance, Lib Dem Education Spokesperson Munira Wilson said the prime minister ""has gone from ducking D-Day to blundering on betting"".""If he was truly angry about this scandal these Conservative candidates would have been suspended,"" she said.Pat McFadden, Labour's National Campaign Coordinator, said Mr Sunak's ""performance tonight was an abject failure"".The Tories hit back: ""It was clear from the debate tonight that Keir Starmer will say just what he thinks you want to hear.""Mr Sunak will step up warnings about handing Labour ""a blank cheque"" at the election later today.Read more:Has Sunak blundered by opting for long, six-week election campaign?Tory voters say gambling scandal won't make a differenceStarmer grilled on U-turnsMr Sunak faced questions after Sir Keir took to the stage for a grilling that mainly centred around his previous support for Jeremy Corbyn and multiple policy U-turns.The Labour leader ducked a volley of questions over whether he truly believed his predecessor would make a ""great"" prime minister, but said he would have been better than Boris Johnson - who went on to win in 2019.On his U-turns, such as rowing back on a promise to abolish university tuition fees and nationalise energy, Sir Keir said he was a ""common sense politician"" and those pledges were no longer financially viable after the damage the Tories had done to the economy.Mr Starmer will be in Scotland today to pledge that Labour's industrial strategy would deliver nearly 70,000 jobs.Davey confronted over-coalition years The event also heard from Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, who faced difficult questions about his record in the coalition years and as postal affairs minister during the Horizon scandal.Challenged by a student over his party abandoning their pledge to scrap tuition fees in the coalition era, he said: ""I understand why your generation lost faith in us. It was a difficult government to be in.""On his time as postal affairs minister between 2010 and 2012, and whether he was proud of that role, he said he made ""two big mistakes"", including failing to initially meet campaigner Alan Bates and not seeing through assurances given to him by the Post Office that there was nothing wrong with the faulty IT system that led to hundreds of wrongful convictions.On the campaign trail today, the Lib Dem leader will call for urgent reform to end the ""appalling situation"" in NHS dentistry.Meanwhile, SNP leader John Swinney, when asked whether he was going to carry on with calling for independence ""until you get the answer you want"", stressed his belief that Scotland would be better as an independent country.""I want Scotland to be like Denmark, or Ireland, or Sweden as an independent country. And when you look at those countries, they are more prosperous, they are more equal, they are fairer than Scotland and the United Kingdom,"" he said.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage - who had complained about being excluded from the leaders' panel - will feature in a separate Question Time next week.

141,"Nigel Farage has praised the misogynist influencer Andrew Tate for being an “important voice” for the “emasculated” and giving boys “perhaps a bit of confidence at school” in online interviews that appear to be aimed at young men over the past year.The Reform UK leader spoke in favour of Tate for defending “male culture” in a Strike It Big podcast that aired in February, while acknowledging that the influencer had gone “over the top” and elsewhere that he had said some “pretty horrible” things.Since December 2022, Tate has been facing charges in Romania of human trafficking, rape, and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women, which he denies.Many politicians and teachers have spoken out against Tate’s influence on young boys in the UK, after the self-proclaimed misogynist said women belonged in the home and were a man’s property. “There’s no way you can be rooted in reality and not be sexist,” Tate said in one video.In other clips reported by the Observer, the British-American kickboxer – who poses with fast cars and guns, and portrays himself as a cigar-smoking playboy – talks about hitting and choking women, trashing their belongings and stopping them from going out. He has now been banned from YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok.Farage’s interviews on the podcasts demonstrate how he has been attempting to appeal to younger audiences on a series of controversialist podcasts and online shows aimed at younger men.He has ranged from arguing against diversity quotas for BAME people, saying “the idea we should give people jobs according to how suntanned they are, the colour of their skin” was nonsense, to suggesting that some people on benefits are “too fat … too stupid, too lazy” to work.In his Strike It Big podcast appearance in February, Farage said Tate had been “an important voice” for men, who were being told that male culture should be looked down on.“Tate was a very important voice for an emasculated … you three guys, you are all 25, you are all kind of being told you can’t be blokes, you can’t do laddish, fun, bloke things … That’s almost what you’re being told. That masculinity is something we should look down upon, something we should frown upon. It’s like the men are becoming feminine and the women are becoming masculine and it’s a bit difficult to tell these days who’s what.“And Tate fed into that by saying, ‘Hang on, what’s wrong with being a bloke? What’s wrong in male culture? What’s wrong in male humour?’ He fed into those things. His was a campaign of raising awareness, his was a campaign of giving people perhaps a bit of confidence at school or whatever it was to speak up …”He acknowledged that Tate “maybe took that alter-ego of masculinity too far in his relationships with women” and that some of things he had said and posted “were over the top”. But he said the “jury is out” on investigations into the influencer. Farage was pictured with Tate in 2019, before the legal case in Romania.Elsewhere in the podcast, Farage said: “The banking sector, now full of idiots, people are promoted not because of ability, but ethnicity or gender … The white male – you lot – are going to feel the world’s against you. Andrew Tate tapped into that. You’re going to feel the world’s against you, you’re going to feel resentful and angry … These are massive cultural battles.”In another podcast from August last year, the Disruptors show hosted by Rob Moore, Farage was asked whether he would rather listen to Andrew Tate or Jordan Peterson, the Canadian psychology professor and culture warrior.“I think Jordan Peterson because I think he is a lot more rounded. I think Andrew Tate is a fascinating figure. I think his speaking to men, who because of the woke agenda were told they couldn’t be male in any way at all, was an important thing. But I feel some of his comments were pretty horrible. Jordan has a much more coherent intellectualism to what he does.”Asked about his podcast appearances, including his comments on Tate, Farage said: “There’s an awakening in a younger generation who have had enough of being dictated to, have had enough of being lectured to. They’re seeing through the rubbish they’re getting taught in schools and universities. If no other politician is willing to reach out to this group of people, then I will.”Alex Davies-Jones, a Labour candidate and shadow minister for domestic violence, said Tate was a “dangerous misogynist who is facing multiple charges of human trafficking and sexual offences – and it is inexplicable that a politician would praise him”.Davies-Jones, who has previously faced death and rape threats for criticising Tate’s “brainwashing” of young boys, added: “Tate is not a positive role model for young boys. He will drag them down a horrific rabbit-hole of objectifying and abusing women. It is never just banter – it is part of a toxic culture that sadly often leads to violence.”On an episode of the Your Round podcast, which aired earlier this month, Farage hit out at the idea of hiring policies that take diversity into account, appearing to describe people of colour as being “suntanned”.“The race thing is even worse. The idea we should give people jobs according to how suntanned they are, the colour of their skin … the whole thing is nonsense. A guy who’s my producer at GB News is half Indian. I’m darker than he is! It’s nonsense.” He later added: “Now we’re saying this person gets this job because they’re black, or they’re gay.”In an appearance on the “free speech” Triggernometry podcast, which has almost 1 million subscribers, in February 2023, Farage claimed that “welfarism, I’m afraid, is making millions of people lazy”.“‘I’m too fat, I’m too stupid, I’m too lazy, I don’t get out of bed in the morning. I smoke drugs, give me money’ … That’s what we’re saying. ‘I don’t need to work, the state will provide for me’ … We cannot afford it,” he said.Other rightwing views aired on the podcast included Farage saying he wished that the former Conservative prime minister Liz Truss had “held her nerve” and stuck to her budget as “a lot of it was good thinking” – although he said it was too much, too fast. He also claimed that Jeremy Hunt taking over as chancellor after the budget triggered a negative market reaction was part of a “globalist coup”.In a further interview with a show called Nomad Capitalist in April 2024, Farage had huge praise for Javier Milei, the far-right libertarian Argentine president famous for posing with a chainsaw, saying he had been bringing in “Thatcherism on steroids – this is incredible, cutting and slashing public expenditure, doing all the things he’s done”, adding: “That’s leadership … he is amazing.” When asked to list the best leaders in the western world, Farage named Hungary’s rightwing leader, Viktor Orbán, a “strong leader”, and his “friend” Donald Trump, the US presidential candidate.Previously, in 2016 on Fox News, Farage praised Vladmir Putin, the Russian president, who he said for “all his faults” was a “strong leader who believes in his own nation”.Farage’s interview commentsFebruary 2023“‘I’m too fat, I’m too stupid, I’m too lazy, I don’t get out of bed in the morning. I smoke drugs, give me money’ … That’s what we’re saying. ‘I don’t need to work, the state will provide for me’ … We cannot afford it.“I welcomed much of [Liz Truss’s] budget. I think if there is a criticism, they tried to do too much, too quickly, without prior explanation … What happened here is the backbenches wobbled really quite quickly because a lot of Conservative backbenchers are basically globalists and listened to those big noises from the multinationals and the IMF. As soon as she sacked Kwarteng, it was all over … I would much have preferred her to hold her nerve, keep making those arguments and see if the party dared get rid of them.”August 2023“I think Andrew Tate is a fascinating figure. I think his speaking to men, who because of the woke agenda were told they couldn’t be male in any way at all, was an important thing. But I feel some of his comments were pretty horrible.”February 2024 “Tate was a very important voice for an emasculated … You three guys, you are all 25, you are all kind of being told you can’t be blokes, you can’t do laddish, fun, bloke things … That’s almost what you’re being told.

264,"Sir Keir Starmer has refused to repeat his claim that Jeremy Corbyn would have been a better prime minister than Boris Johnson.The Labour Party leader was asked on Friday about a remark he made during the BBC Question Time special on Thursday night.Hosting the programme, Fiona Bruce asked him five times to explain why he had said in the run-up to the 2019 election that Mr Corbyn would be a “great prime minister”.Sir Keir eventually said: “He would be a better prime minister… look what we got, Boris Johnson, a man who made massive promises, didn’t keep them, and then had to leave Parliament in disgrace.”Speaking to broadcasters on Friday, Sir Keir did not repeat those words but said: “The choice at the last election before the electorate was not a good choice.Sir Keir appearing in the Question Time special on Thursday night - BBC“You had Boris Johnson, who won and then three years later was thrown out of Parliament for breaking the rules, you had Jeremy Corbyn who is now expelled from the Labour Party.“That’s why I have been so determined to change the Labour Party and to make sure that that changed Labour Party puts forward a credible manifesto for growth so that at this election, there will be a real choice between carrying on with the failure of the last 14 years or turning the page and rebuilding the country with a Labour government.”‘I have changed Labour’Asked again if he thought Mr Corbyn would have been a better premier, Sir Keir said: “I have changed the Labour Party because after that election result, we needed to ensure we were a party which proudly said ‘country first, party second’, with a manifesto for change, and that’s what we have put before the electorate.”Peter Kyle, Labour’s shadow science secretary, earlier declined to say if he also believed Mr Corbyn would have been a better prime minister than Mr Johnson.Asked the question four times by LBC’s Nick Ferrari, he repeated an identical answer each time.‘Difficult days’“Those were difficult days in our politics, and we each had to find our own way through it,” Mr Kyle said.He added: “But the key thing is in 2019, we had that general election, and the voters told us definitively. If you’re in politics, you’ve got to listen to voters, and they told us definitively that our party had to change.“Keir Starmer led our party through that change and he now has a party that’s fit for service because of the change.”Since winning the party leadership in 2020, Sir Keir has distanced himself from his predecessor, who is standing against Labour as an independent.He was criticised last week for describing the Conservative manifesto as a “sort of Jeremy Corbyn-style manifesto where anything you want can go in it, none of it is costed”.He supported the manifestos drawn up for the 2017 and 2019 elections during Mr Corbyn’s leadership.Momentum, the Left-wing campaign group, said Sir Keir was guilty of “attacking your own side” and Sir Simon Clarke, the Tory ex-minister, criticised him for his “sheer nerve”.",Starmer refuses to repeat ‘Corbyn better as PM than Johnson’ claim,11,11
192,"Rishi Sunak has declined to rule out that a Cabinet minister is involved in the Tory gambling scandal.The Gambling Commission is looking into four figures with links to the Prime Minister over allegations they bet on a July election before it was announced using insider knowledge.The commission is understood to be working through a list of names provided by bookmakers of people who made £200 or more betting on a July general election in the three weeks before it was made public.On Friday, the Prime Minister was twice asked to publicly rule out that a Cabinet minister could be involved.During a press conference at the launch of the Welsh Tories’ manifesto, Mr Sunak was asked whether he was confident a Cabinet minister had not placed a bet on a July election.The Prime Minister responded by saying the revelations had left him “incredibly angry” and that it was “right they are investigated” but fell short of explicitly ruling out the development.Asked again, Mr Sunak said: “The job of the Gambling Commission and the police is to investigate anything that they think that is not right.“And they should be allowed to get on with that, and it’s not for you or anyone else to speculate on that.”Senior party insiders insisted that they did not currently believe a Cabinet minister was involved.However, it is understood that Conservative Campaign Headquarters does not know who else could be caught up in the Gambling Commission investigations and is braced for other Tories to be named.There was a sudden rush of bets on the possibility of a July 4 election on May 21, according to betting data analysis. The snap election was announced by Mr Sunak the following day.Four figures are currently known to be under investigation.Craig Williams, a senior aide to Mr Sunak who is also an MP candidate, is being investigated by the Gambling Commission after reporting getting £100 on the election date just before it was called. He has apologised for having a “flutter” on the election.Tony Lee, the Conservative director of campaigning, and Laura Saunders, his wife and a Tory candidate, are also both understood to be under investigation by the commission.Both Mr Williams and Ms Saunders remain Tory candidates for the election.A police officer working in Mr Sunak’s close protection team has also been arrested as part of a separate investigation into bets placed on the timing of the election.Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s shadow paymaster general, jumped on Mr Sunak’s refusal to rule out that a Cabinet minister could be involved. He said: “Today Rishi Sunak has refused to rule out that further members of the Conservative Party, including Cabinet ministers, are involved in this betting scandal. He needs to come clean with the public.“He promised integrity, professionalism and accountability, instead his weakness means he has overseen the same levels of sleaze and scandal that have come to epitomise the last 14 years of Tory government.“Rishi Sunak needs to take immediate action against all implicated.”Angela Rayner added that the Prime Minister “should reveal what he knows about what happened – and also I find it astonishing that action hasn’t been taken in regards to that”.It comes as polling by YouGov found that the Conservative betting scandal was the one of the news stories about which the British public were most aware this week.Some 17 per cent of respondents said they had noticed the story, compared to 8 per cent being aware of coverage of the European Championship.Mr Sunak has insisted that if anyone is found to have broken the rules they will be thrown out of the Conservative Party, but he said it was important to wait for the outcome of the investigation.‘Betting on inside info stinks’On Friday, Tom Tugendhat, the security minister, expected to run for the Tory leadership at the next contest, told The Telegraph: “Betting on inside information stinks. It’s wrong and those involved must go.”A Conservative spokesman said: “We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals.“As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn’t be proper to comment further until any process is concluded.”In a statement, Ms Saunders’ solicitor said that she would be cooperating with the watchdog’s investigation.The statement added: “It is inappropriate to conduct any investigation of this kind via the media, and doing so risks jeopardising the work of the Gambling Commission and the integrity of its investigation.”A spokesman for the Gambling Commission said: “Currently, the commission is investigating the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election.“This is an ongoing investigation, and the commission cannot provide any further details at this time.“We are not confirming or denying the identity of any individuals involved in this investigation.”",Rishi Sunak declines to rule out a minister is involved in gambling scandal,11,11
337,"The outlook was already looking bleak for the Conservative Party when Rishi Sunak called the general election following months of dismal approval ratings that showed little sign of improving.At a campaign event last week, Sunak said he didn't think defeat to Labour was a ""foregone conclusion"", suggesting his main election rival Sir Keir Starmer was taking the British electorate ""for granted"".However, a general election projection released on Monday will have added to the Tories' woes – predicting the biggest win for Labour in the party's history, surpassing even that of Tony Blair's 1997 landslide.The analysis, carried out by YouGov for Sky News, used a relatively new polling technique called Multi-level Regression and Post-stratification (MRP), which is regarded to have had a good track record and can provide detailed predictions at a constituency level basis. The scale of Sunak's problems is demonstrated by the interactive maps below, showing just how much ground the Tories are expected to lose compared to their 2019 victory.Click on the arrows in the top left to switch between the two maps. Check your own constituency to see if it is projected to change handsThe first map above shows the seats won in the 2019 general election, when Boris Johnson led the party to a stunning majority.The wall of Tory blue on the map, compared to the spots of Labour red, is a demonstration of just how far Labour, then led by Jeremy Corbyn, had fallen in public standing. The result was Labour's worst electoral performance since 1935.If you toggle to the second map, the projection by YouGov (which was based on polling carried out between 24 May - 1 June) suggests that Starmer's party is on track to win 422 seats, with the Tories down to just 140.Such a result would be the Conservative Party's worst performance at a general election since 1906. If YouGov's predictions are accurate, Labour winning a 194-seat majority would be the highest number since Conservative Stanley Baldwin won a majority of 208 in 1924.The model suggests the Conservatives could be set for near wipeout across many areas of the country, including London, the North East, the North West, and Wales.It also projects that the Scottish National Party would lose more than half their seats, with Labour returning as the largest party north of the border, and the Liberal Democrats reclaiming its place as the third party of British politics – winning 48 seats.The new figures, released yesterday, came as Reform UK co-founder Nigel Farage announced that he would be returning as the populist party's leader and would stand for election in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. Even before Farage's latest bid, pollsters told Yahoo News that Reform UK could pose a serious threat to the Tories by splitting the vote and potentially handing even more seats to Labour.The YouGov projection follows a similar poll by modelling site Electoral Calculus, which came out on 31 May. The polling also compares the 2019 result with Electoral Calculus' projection.It predicts that Labour is on course to win an even bigger majority of 319 seats - with Starmer's party picking up 485 MPs and the Tories way behind with 66. The modelling shows the Lib Dems getting very close to the Conservative Party, with 59 seats.While Electoral Calculus' polling, based on opinion polls from 8 May to 20 May, returns a different set of projections to YouGov's, both clearly indicate the scale of the problem facing Sunak.The Electoral Calculus model has predicted Sir Keir Starmer's Labour will win a massive majority.

280,"Sir Keir Starmer's crackdown could 'change the economics [of investments] dramatically' - Labour PartyLabour risks destroying a key investment pipeline helping to grow the UK’s next generation of $1bn businesses if it launches a tax raid on the City, one of its advisers has warned.Anne Glover, chief executive of Amadeus Capital Partners, a venture capitalist firm that has invested in 190 mostly British businesses, said Sir Keir Starmer’s proposed crackdown on private equity would “change the economics [of investments] dramatically” and lead to an exodus of cash and talent in the sector.Venture capitalists hope to back growth businesses, taking big risks to fund small companies with prospects of becoming much larger concerns.ADVERTISEMENTTypically the goal is to find potential “unicorns”, which are companies with a valuation of at least $1bn.While Ms Glover, who was one of 10 advisers Labour consulted as part of its review of financial services, said the party “absolutely” understood the importance of supporting entrepreneurs, she told the Telegraph that proposals to change the treatment of so-called carried interest would cost the Exchequer money instead of bringing it in.Carried interest is one of the main ways that fund managers at private equity and venture capitalist firms pay themselves.Currently the share of a fund’s investment profits is taxed at the capital gains rate of 28pc. Labour wants to close what it has branded a “loophole” and treat this performance-related pay as income. This would mean the money would be taxed at 45pc for most individuals.But Ms Glover said companies would be forced to reappraise their investment if the rules were changed.“It would change the economics for all of the people who work in it dramatically,” she said. “Instead of working for 10 to 12 years to achieve a great capital outcome alongside entrepreneurs who are also getting a great capital outcome, you get taxed as if it was income, which it isn’t.”An attempt to change carried interest rules in the US was blocked by a senator in 2022.Ms Glover said: “It’s recognised worldwide that it’s appropriately taxed as capital gain. So we would be quite out of step with the rest of Europe and the US if we did change those rules.”Story continuesShe warned that the consequences for the economy from an exodus of talent and capital were huge.Ms Glover said: “I would predict that they would lose as much in lost activity because the private equity guys can move, they’ll just go live somewhere else.”She added that for venture capital firms like hers that must stay in the UK to support the early-stage companies they invest in, the impact would be more insidious.Ms Glover said: “I think it’s a long term consequence, not a short term consequence. I think you’ll just attract less talent into the business and [by that] I mean less successful companies.”Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has already suggested that fund managers who make bets with their own money will continue to see capital gains taxed as such. However, the Labour Party also estimates it could raise more than £500m from the roughly 2,000 people who receive carried interest each year.“We [put ourselves] at risk for years. We accept lower salaries – massively lower salaries than the rest of the financial industry. We take personal risk by putting our own money alongside our investors. And then if we are successful – and by the way it’s only half of firms that are ever successful – the ones [that are] get a large lump sum, probably eight to 14 years after you start working on a portfolio,” said Ms Glover.“So then, to have taken all of that risk and done it at a much reduced income level in order to align yourself with [other investors] and entrepreneurs, both of whom get taxed on capital gains, why should we be treated differently?”",Labour adviser sounds alarm on Keir Starmer’s City tax raid,11,11
302,"The Conservatives have received just a tenth of the private donations they did in 2019 in a stark revelation of the state of the party’s campaign finances.Figures released by the Electoral Commission show the party brought in £889,000 from private sources in the first two weeks of the campaign.That figure represents only a tenth of the £8.7 million raked in during the same period in the 2019 election.Labour received private donations worth £4.2 million in the second week of the campaign, 14 times as much as the Conservatives who received £292,500 between June 6 and 12.It brings the total donations given to Sir Keir Starmer’s party in the first two weeks of the campaign to £5.1 million.The Conservatives’ largest donations in the second week of the campaign were £50,000 each from Bestway Wholesale, a company ultimately owned by Tory peer Lord Zameer Choudrey through the Guernsey-based Bestway Group, and an organisation called The Spring Lunch.The Spring Lunch is an unincorporated association and therefore does not have to provide records of who controls it, although it is registered to an address in Pulham St Mary, Norfolk.Significant donorsLabour’s largest donation was £2.5 million from Lord Sainsbury, the former chairman of the eponymous supermarket chain who gave £8 million to the Liberal Democrats in 2019.Other significant donors were Gary Lubner, the Autoglass chief, who gave £900,000, and hedge fund manager Martin Taylor, who donated £700,000.In total, Labour’s private donations for the first two weeks of the campaign amounted to £5,157,400, more than 14 times the £361,042 they received throughout the entirety of the 2019 campaign.The Electoral Commission figures, which collate donations from private individuals and companies between June 6 and 12, also show that Reform UK brought in donations worth more than three times more than those given to the Conservatives.Nigel Farage’s party raised a total of £742,000, largely thanks to a £500,000 donation from Britain Means Business Ltd, a company controlled by Richard Tice, the party chairman.Reform also received £50,000 from Holly Valance, the former pop star and Neighbours actor who is a prominent supporter.The Liberal Democrats received £335,000 in the second week of the campaign, taking their total for the election to £789,999.Other donations included £150,000 from businessman Safwan Adam and a £100,000 bequest from John Faulkner, a long-standing party member who left the party £1 million in his will in 2023.Political parties are required to provide weekly reports of donations of more than £11,180, after the Government increased the threshold from £7,500 in January.",Conservatives’ private donations down 90 per cent on last election campaign,11,11
56,"Follow the money, the saying goes. But the money isn't following the Conservative Party in this election campaign. Tory donors are on strike.The Conservatives are not only being massively outgunned financially by Labour, but also by Reform UK and the Liberal Democrats, according to new figures.Election latest: More bad news for Tory campaign The slump in donations, compared with the millions pouring into Tory coffers during Boris Johnson's 2019 campaign, suggests massive disillusionment in Rishi Sunak among Tory tycoons and millionaires.Why throw good money after bad? That's a question the Conservatives' former big money donors must be asking themselves with Mr Sunak's campaign appearing to lurch from one crisis to another.And the party's dismal showing in opinion polls, along with blunders like the prime minister's D-Day fiasco and now a scandal over insiders accused of betting on the election date, suggest the funding gap will get even worse.The latest figures from the Electoral Commission, generally a fairly toothless watchdog, are the first since Mr Sunak's calamitous snub to D-Day veterans and also confirm that Nigel Farage's comeback has boosted Reform UK's finances.The figures are staggeringUsually, league tables of donations to political parties put the Tories way out in front. Not this time. Donations between 6 and 12 June reveal the Conservatives are in fourth place. That's relegation form.In that week, Labour received a breathtaking £4,383,400, largely due to a £2.5m cheque from Lord Sainsbury of the supermarket dynasty. That means £5.3m in donations rolled in during the first two weeks of the campaign.A big Blairite, Lord Sainsbury is a long-time donor who stopped giving when Jeremy Corbyn was leader. But now he's back. Big time. Labour's other big donor, Autoglass windscreens tycoon Gary Lubner, gave £900,000.At election time, the general secretaries of the big trade unions usually get their cheque book out and hand over six or seven-figure sums. But between 6-12 June the only union donation was £100,000 from the train drivers' union Aslef.That means Sir Keir Starmer's Labour Party is relying more now on millionaires than union barons for its election fighting fund. The Labour leader says the party's changed. Well, this is certainly a very significant change.Read more:Farage: West 'provoked' Russia's invasion of UkraineAnalysis: Sunak misjudged audience on key issueBut at what price?

47,"Ed Davey has been involved in a number of comedy stunts since the election was called. (Alamy) With the spotlight on prime minister Rishi Sunak and Labour leader Keir Starmer as they prepare to slug it out in a general election campaign, the focus had started slipping from Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey until a series of stunts put him back in the spotlight.The former coalition government cabinet minister - who lost his seat, punished by voters for getting into bed with the Tories, but then won it back again - is sending a clear message that he should not be overlooked.He’s had a long political career and the climax may still be ahead: if polls continue to shift away from the Conservatives at the current trajectory, there’s a slim possibility that, if the election is held in October, he could end up as Leader of the Opposition.So what do we know about the man behind the third party in British politics? Hannah Fearn finds out.His early lifeEd Davey was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on Christmas Day in 1965. He was the youngest of three boys, but lost his father at just four years old, and his mother followed over a decade later when he was in his mid-teens. She spent three years battling cancer, during which time he nursed his mother together with his grandmother and brother Henry.Once a keen Scout and Air Scout, he later remembers feeling “isolated” at school because of his caring responsibilities, which meant he couldn’t take part in after-school activities or sports. “The last 18 months she was bedridden and in a lot of pain. I’d spend hours on the bed, talking to her,” he said. Davey was with his mother when she died at Nottingham General Hospital, after being placed on an unsuited dementia ward.After both his parents had died, Davey was brought up by his maternal grandparents in the village of Eakring, though his grandfather died soon after. He spent much of his childhood and young adulthood close to his grandmother. “First of all, she was looking after me. Then we were looking after each other,” he said.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

After school, he achieved a first class degree in philosophy, politics and economics at Jesus College, Oxford where he was junior common room president.

He was knighted in the 2016 New Year’s Honours for “political and public services”.Davey on... the cost of living crisisDavey has repeatedly attacked the government for failing to curb rapid inflation and the devastating effect it is having on household budgets. He called the Conservative Party “so out of touch they might as well be living on another planet”, and said he warned Jeremy Hunt “people are desperate for real help… but all the chancellor could offer is empty words and unfair tax hikes”. In particular, he has urged more action on food price inflation, which analysis from his own party found had risen 37 per cent in one year for the average weekly supermarket trip. He has promised to end energy hikes and abandoned his plan to add 1p to income tax to save the NHS because ordinary voters can no longer afford it.Davey on... the NHSThe Liberal Democrats have made the NHS a cornerstone of their policy platform for the last five years. In Davey’s words: “Voting Conservative is bad for your health.” He promises to reverse cuts to GP numbers and guarantee a doctor’s appointment when you need one, improve access to NHS dentistry and save lives by tackling ambulance call out delays. Davey blames the care crisis for deepening the problems of the health service and says his party would spend £5bn a year on a “care package” to ensure patients are discharged from hospital more quickly, freeing up bed space.

He has called for Conservative plans to deport failed asylum seekers to Rwanda a “cynical distraction” from the partygate crisis and the money would be better spent on measures to tackle the cost of living crisis. He added: “They’ve provided no evidence to suggest that this new policy will stop illegal smuggling, they’re not cracking down on the organised crime gangs, which is what you need to do.” He has called for a new right to work for refugees and asylum seekers, and major reform of the Home Office which he says is no longer up to the job. After the end of the coalition government, Davey has said his party “was wrong” to go along with the introduction of a minimum income standard for immigrants. He later described the policy as “nasty and unfair”.Davey on... the Post Office scandalDespite the Horizon scandal that led to the wrongful prosecution of more than 700 subpostmasters crossing the tenure of more than a dozen business secretaries, Ed Davey has recently taken the heat for failing to investigate the issue while he was in the job.It has emerged that Davey initially rejected a request to meet justice campaigner Alan Bates, and later accepted it only on the advice that it would be good for his PR.

Meanwhile, his wife Laura Saunders – a candidate in Bristol and who has worked for the party since 2015 – and Craig Williams, Mr Sunak’s parliamentary private secretary, are under investigation for placing bets on the poll date just before the surprise snap election was announced.Mr Williams, who is Mr Sunak’s closest aide, has admitted he made a “huge error of judgement” betting on the election date.Campaigning in Wales, Mr Sunak refused to be drawn on whether he was aware of other Conservative candidates or officials who had placed bets on a 4 July election, saying there were “multiple investigations” under way that were “independent” and “confidential”.He dodged a follow-up question on whether he could rule out a member of the cabinet having also placed a bet, instead repeating that it was a job for the Gambling Commission and the police to investigate.Anyone found to have broken the rules should “not only face the full consequences of the law, but I will ensure that they are booted out of the Conservative Party too”, he added.The Conservatives have confirmed they have been contacted by the commission “about a small number of individuals”.Craig Williams served as the prime minister’s parliamentary private secretary (PA Media)Sir Keir said: “The prime minister is showing a total lack of leadership. Of course he should suspend these candidates. If they were my candidates, they’d be gone by now, out of the door. He needs to take tough action. He’s not even saying today whether there are more involved.”Liberal Democrats have called for WhatsApps about betting to be investigated. The party’s Sarah Olney said: “WhatsApp messages of the Prime Minister’s inner circle must be handed over to the Cabinet Office, or else it raises suspicion of yet more Conservative cover-ups.”Mr Sunak has said he is “incredibly angry” that members of his inner circle have been caught up in the furore over bets on the date of the election.But he has refused to suspend either candidate.Betfair data appears to show a flurry of bets on a July election were placed on 21 May – the day before Mr Sunak made his suprise announcement – including some worth hundreds of pounds at odds that would have delivered returns in the thousands.David TC Davies (Getty Images)Paul Scully, a former Tory minister, described the looming vote as a “punishment election” for the party, that the outcry over gambling allegations would exacerbate.“It feels like we’re shooting ourselves in the foot and we’re not millipedes. We’ve only got two feet,” he said. “When you’ve got people that are wanting to punish the Conservatives and so they’re going to be looking under the microscope at absolutely everything that we do and then we’re making it easy for them to punish us even further on that basis.”Mr Grieve said that voters recognised the “good” the Coalition Government did until 2015, “despite the pain” of austerity but expected a much better period to follow.Instead, he said Brexit led to “a high level of political chaos which was thoroughly predictable and therefore rests upon the shoulders of those who created it in the first place, namely those who advocated a reckless policy.“And then to solve it, because they were becoming desperate, they went and got themselves a prime minister who was in fact a charlatan. And he behaved exactly a way that was both predictable and predicted.“And in fact, for all his boosterism and the fact he took them to an extraordinary election, because charlatanism often works in the short term, people landed in the long term with a massive problem of loss of public confidence, and then loss of public confidence in the integrity of government.”Dominic Grieve, the former Tory attorney general, said the party was getting what “they deserve” after years of chaos (AFP via Getty Images)“Then they were so desperate … they went off and got somebody who wrecked the economy in 49 days and caused even more trouble.”He added: “They seem to be surprised that having done all this receiving recognition they deserve their efforts. But it seems to me that getting exactly the recognition they deserve for their efforts. Which is that they’re held in contempt by the electorate.”He added that that was “unfair in one sense” to many, including the current prime minister. But he added: “It should not come as a surprise to them that this is a punishment election”.",Tories ‘held in contempt by the electorate’ as pressure mounts on Rishi Sunak over betting scandal,11,9
368,"When polls close on July 4 after a six-week campaign, Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer will eagerly await results from the UK’s 650 constituencies to find out who will become the next prime minister.Exit polls from 10pm will give them a snapshot of what to expect from the national picture, before the first results start to trickle in across the coming hours.The latest opinion polls suggest the Conservatives are on track to win as few as 53 seats, although more optimistic surveys suggest they could win around 150. A recent Telegraph poll predicted the Prime Minister will become the first ever to lose his seat at a general election.Here is everything you need to know about the election night timings.When will election results be announced?Results from the 2024 general election will begin to trickle in from around 11pm on Thursday July 4, following the closing of polling stations at 10pm.Most of the constituency results are expected in the early hours of Friday July 5, with the final seats projected to announce their winners by 10am.In 2019, the first declaration came at 11.27pm when Newcastle City Council beat local rival Sunderland to announce Labour’s candidate Chi Onwurah as the first MP of the new parliament.The record for the earliest declaration remains 10.43pm by the former seat of Sunderland South in 2001.When was the 2019 election result called?Boris Johnson won a sweeping victory for the Conservatives in 2019 after selling the public on his mandate to “get Brexit done”.The first exit polls came back just after 10pm when polls had closed and Mr Johnson’s overall majority was confirmed at 5am.By 7am, it became clear the Tories were on course for their biggest majority at Westminster since that of Margaret Thatcher.What happens when results start being called?When voting closes, an exit poll will be announced following a survey of voters taken from about 150 constituencies in England, Scotland and Wales, giving an indication of the likely result.However, leaders will have to wait until one party receives enough votes for a majority under the first-past-the-post electoral system.In 2019, Mr Johnson’s majority was announced at 5am, although it was not until every constituency had called its results that the extent of his landslide victory with a 43 per cent vote share emerged.When is the general election?The UK will head to the polls on Thursday July 4 to vote on the country’s next leader, with polling stations open between 7am and 10pm.The Prime Minister announced the snap summer election in a rain-sodden speech outside Downing Street on May 22, setting in motion the vote six weeks later.Registration for the general election has now closed and it is too late to apply for a postal vote. However, those eligible can still use a proxy ballot to have someone vote on their behalf.",What time will we get the general election results?,11,11
209,"Rishi Sunak has the fight of his political life ahead of him after calling a snap general election for 4 July. The polls have consistently painted a very bleak picture for the prime minister, with Labour holding on to a double-digit poll lead over his Conservatives.Recent by-election results suggest that Labour is likely to win a landslide victory – but there’s still time for the PM to turn it around.Here’s everything you need to know about Sunak and what’s he’s saying about the biggest issues in British politics right now.Early lifeSunak was born in Southampton in 1980, the eldest of three children. His Indian parents both arrived from East Africa in the 1960s. A football-mad boy whose childhood idol was Matt Le Tissier, Sunak was described by the family’s neighbours as a child with “lovely manners”.In his youngest years, the PM attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. According to a recent biography, fellow pupil Ollie Case said: “He was someone that was talked about. The teachers would say: ‘He’s going to be prime minister'.""But, growing up in the 1980s and 90s, he also remembers experiencing racism. “My mother was obsessed with us not having accents,” Sunak has said.Rishi Sunak was football-mad as a boy growing up in Southampton. (ITV)Sunak's familySunak is married to Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian entrepreneur and multi-billionaire. The pair first met in 2004 at Stanford University, his future wife apparently attracted to his “honesty and integrity”.Five years later they married in a two-day Indian wedding held in Bangalore. The couple have two daughters, Krishna and Anoushka, who will turn 13 and 11 this year, both of whom are largely kept out of the public eye.Sunak attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. (Rishi Sunak, Instagram)His parentsYashvir Sunak, Rishi’s father, was born in Kenya. He arrived in the UK to study medicine and then stayed, becoming an NHS GP. His mother, Usha, was born in Tanzania and is a pharmacist.The couple met in Britain and settled in Southampton in the 1970s. Usha is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.His educationAs a teenager Sunak studied at Winchester College where he was, he says, a self-confessed “geek”. According to a recent biography, the “naughtiest” thing the prime minister did during his school days “was to smuggle a hand-held television into the school so that he did not miss any key games of Euro 96”.The childhood home of Rishi Sunak in Southampton. (Getty Images, photo taken in 2022)Perhaps unsurprisingly for someone with such an unblemished record, he went on to become the school’s head boy. Sunak worked while studying, delivering medicines for his mother’s pharmacy and as a waiter at a local Indian restaurant.After school, Sunk read philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, graduating in 2001 with a first class degree. While still at university he held an internship at the Conservative Party campaign headquarters and joined the party, but went on studying before entering politics.He earned his MBA from Stanford in 2006 as a Fulbright Scholar, meaning he was selected among the most promising candidates from the UK.How much is he worth?As prime minister, Rishi Sunak earns £80,807 on top of a salary of £84,144 for being an MP. But his current income from Westminster pales in comparison to his family’s vast wealth through marriage.The Sunday Times valued the couple’s joint fortune at £730m. Murty's father is the co-founder of Infosys, an Indian tech conglomerate, in which she holds shares estimated at around £430m. Her family is also involved in a £900m business arrangement with Amazon in India, and she is a shareholder of multiple other companies.Rishi Sunak's mother is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.Before entering politics Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and a series of hedge funds. He is also known to have invested in blind trusts, in which investments are made without holders knowing where the funds are located. These arrangements reportedly hold Sunak’s own multi-million-pound fortune.His religionSunak is not only the first prime minister of colour and of Indian heritage but he is also the first practising Hindu to hold the biggest job in UK politics.He has spoken of his pride in his Hindu faith, saying, “that’s how I was raised, and that’s how I am”. He said: “Having faith gives you resilience, gives you strength that is important and it provides an outlook on life which I find particularly valuable.”Sunak on... the NHSThe prime minister’s biggest challenge in office has been the crisis in the NHS - and to many people in the sector his government has been found wanting. “We have not made enough progress,” Sunak said when asked about his commitment to cut NHS waiting lists during an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV. Asked if that meant he had failed, the prime minister replied: “Yes, we have.""Sunak expects to see waiting lists start to reduce this spring, and blames the delays on “industrial action”, as disputes with junior doctors and consultants over pay and conditions continue. Yet Sunak himself has been blamed for holding up a deal that would prevent more walkouts.Sunak, his wife Akshata and daughters Anoushka and Krishna (second left) at Santa Monica Pier, California, on their summer holiday in 2023. (AP)Sunak on… immigrationAccording to the prime minister, illegal migration threatens to “overwhelm” Europe. In June 2023 he claimed his plan to “stop the boats” and tackle illegal immigration was working, but by August 2023 he had changed his mind: “It’s not an easy problem to fix,” he told broadcasters. “I never said we would be able to solve it overnight.”He has staked much of his reputation on the government's Rwanda Bill - his plan to deport asylum seekers to the east African country that finally became law last month, after months of legal and procedural challenges. It has paved the way for deportation flights to get off the ground within weeks.He described his policy, which he says will act as a deterrent to people traffickers, as being “the will of the people” – yet polling suggests low support for such a punitive approach.The policy, coupled with Conservative talk of limits on legal migration, shows that the government is committed to taking a hard line on the issue, despite the risk of alienating more moderate voters.The Rwanda policy is not universally popular. (YouGov)Sunak on... the cost of living crisisThe prime minister has told hard-pressed working families that they will feel some relief from the cost of living crisis as inflation continues to drop following its highs of October 2022. He described the government’s tax cuts as “meaningful” and has welcomed the dip in mortgage rates at the turn of the year.Sunak says falling inflation will have the biggest impact on family budgets “and will start to ease some of those pressures” and that he was right to focus on that figure. However, the global drop in energy prices is probably the biggest factor in easing the hit on wallets - something that the prime minister has no control over.However, the fall in inflation to 2.3% on 22 May this year – the lowest it has been in nearly three years – was likely one of the key factors in persuading Sunak to call a snap election many weeks earlier than experts had predicted.Can we expect more handouts or tax breaks to help balance family budgets? Not according to Sunak, who has warned voters that it’s time to “move on” from government support.Sunak on... pensionsThe triple-lock pensions policy is a tricky one for Sunak – especially since Labour has committed to retaining the policy. Any change to a policy that has become a hallmark of recent Conservative governments would not go down well with the 12 million pensioners it would likely impact – many of whom are lifelong Tory voters.Last November, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said pensions should start being pegged to an average of inflation and wage growth, which would help reduce state spending over time.Sunak’s response to that was ambiguous to say the least: “We are the government that has … delivered the triple lock and it is why, right now, pensions are, depending on how you look at it, £800 or £900 bigger than they otherwise would have been.” He is yet to confirm whether it will appear in the manifesto.","Who is Rishi Sunak?

86,"JK Rowling has accused Sir Keir Starmer of “abandoning women” who are concerned about gender ideology.The Harry Potter author accused the Labour leader of having a “dismissive and often offensive” attitude to feminists in a dramatic intervention into the general election.“As long as Labour remains dismissive and often offensive towards women fighting to retain the rights their foremothers thought were won for all time, I’ll struggle to support them,” she said.“The women who wouldn’t wheesht [be quiet] didn’t leave Labour. Labour abandoned them.”Writing in an article for The Times, Ms Rowling also attacked Sir Keir for failing to defend Rosie Duffield, the gender-critical Labour MP who was investigated by her own party and has received death threats for her gender-critical views.“Rosie has received literally no support from Starmer over the threats and abuse, some of which has originated from within the Labour Party itself, and has had a severe, measurable impact on her life,” said Ms Rowling.JK Rowling with Rosie Duffield, Labour candidate for Canterbury - InstagramMs Rowling’s intervention came after Sir Keir Starmer was accused of misogyny by women’s rights groups, who said he had only changed his views on gender after listening to a man.On Thursday night’s BBC Question Time, the Labour leader was asked whether he agreed with Rosie Duffield, Labour candidate, on the issue of sex and gender.Ms Duffield has long argued that spaces for biological women need to be protected, and that trans women should not be viewed as the same as biological women.He replied that he now believed the same as Sir Tony Blair, that men had penises and women vaginas.Ms Duffield, the Labour candidate for Canterbury who was previously investigated by the party over her gender-critical views, tweeted sarcastically: “From now on, I shall be submitting my every comment and thought (particularly those mainstream views which most people agree with) to the former Labour prime minister so that it may officially be de-toxified.”Sir Keir has been criticised over his comments by women’s rights groups Fair Play for Women, the Women’s Rights Network and Sex Matters.‘Still has a woman problem’Heather Binning, founder of the Women’s Rights Network, said: “Last night on Question Time, Keir Starmer was asked about comments he had previously made about Rosie Duffield’s position on sex and gender.“It was telling he chose to respond by saying he agreed with Tony Blair – a man. He could have said that despite his attempt to avoid a clear definition of ‘woman’ three years ago he of course understands the immutability of sex and the need to protect single-sex spaces.“The Labour Party isn’t alone in demonstrating that it still has a woman problem when it comes to the topic of sex and gender. Starmer should show some leadership: clarity on the importance of sex protects women and girls, which is surely not a vote loser.”In 2021 Sir Keir claimed it was “not right” to say that only women have a cervix amid a row involving Ms Duffield.In April 2023, the Labour leader then said that “99.9 per cent of women… haven’t got a penis”.Three months later, he changed his stance again, and said a woman is “an adult female”.On Question Time, Sir Keir said: “On the biology, I agree with what Tony Blair said in relation to men having penises and women having vaginas.”‘We lost sight of people’However, in a seeming criticism of activists who do not believe in trans ideology, he added: “I was worried by the way in which the debate was being conducted: it got very toxic… and we lost sight of people in that.”Dr Nicola Williams, director of Fair Play For Women, said in response: “The way Keir Starmer has dismissed women’s sex-based rights as ‘toxic’ and his failure to grasp the real-world harm done by defining ‘woman’ as an identity instead of a material reality, are a type of misogyny we increasingly see on the Left of politics.“They mean I couldn’t possibly vote for Labour. If he fails to understand that women’s rights depend on understanding what it means to be a woman then what else does he fail to understand?“If he is too cowardly to stand up to trans activists who prioritise the demands of trans-identifying men ahead of the needs of women, he doesn’t deserve to be prime minister.”Helen Joyce, director of advocacy at Sex Matters, said: “Protecting women in both everyday situations such as changing rooms and in specialist settings such as prisons and hospitals means recognising that there are just two sexes, and that no one can change sex.“Politicians of all parties have been confused and misled by the rhetoric of the trans lobby, which insists that how people identify matters more than their biology. Whoever forms the next government cannot keep ducking this issue.”On Friday, the Labour leader killed off Nicola Sturgeon’s gender self-ID law after he pledged that a UK government veto will remain in force if he becomes prime minister.On a visit to Scotland, the Labour leader was explicit that there would be no change in position from No 10 under his premiership, leaving no prospect of the legislation coming into force.",JK Rowling accuses Sir Keir Starmer of ‘abandoning women’,11,11
147,"Now that Nigel Farage has taken over as the leader of Reform UK, Richard Tice’s public profile is fading fast - but the Reform chairman remains involved in the party's operations.So far, the party has only one MP, Conservative defector Lee Anderson. But a recent poll has shown Reform overtaking the Tories, raising the possibility Anderson could hold his seat and even end up with fellow Reformers in the next Parliament.As the candidate for Hartlepool, where he stood as the Brexit Party candidate in 2019, Tice hopes to be one of them. So who is he, and what does he stand for?Childhood and educationBorn in Surrey in 1964 to James Tice, a showjumper, and Joan Tice, a horse trainer. Educated at the private boarding school Uppingham, he studied at the University of Salford, gaining a degree in construction economics and quantity surveying – teeing him up for a career that he said would ""continue the family genes in the property industry"".Family (partner & kids)Tice has three children from a 24-year marriage that ended in divorce. He is now in a long-term relationship with the right-wing writer and journalist Isabel Oakeshott.She is perhaps best known for two notorious incidents that set her against leading Tories: a book that featured the heavily disputed allegation that David Cameron had engaged in sexual activity with a pig, and the release of embarrassing messages entrusted to her by Matt Hancock when she agreed to write a book with him.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election? Full list mappedThe key issues that will decide the electionWhen is the first UK general election TV debate?What is purdah? The strict rule that governs what politicians can and can't sayNet worthWhile not quite in the same league as Rishi Sunak, Tice is one of the wealthiest people in British politics. As he describes it on his website, he made his multi-million-pound fortune over the course of “30 years of making things happen in property investment”, starting with a graduate job at a London firm in 1987.According to Tice, the company he leads as CEO, Quidnet Capital, has “bought and managed £500 million in commercial properties across the UK on behalf of clients”.He was also a key figure in the redevelopment of London’s Nine Elms district, near Battersea Power Station, a controversial project that has transformed a stretch of the Thames’s south bank with a welter of rapidly erected high-rise blocks.GB News linksAlong with Nigel Farage, Lee Anderson and several MPs on the right flank of the Tory party, Tice is a regular on the hard-right, culture war-focused TV outlet GB News. There he hosts a programme called “Richard Tice’s Sunday Sermon”, which serves as a platform for him to deliver his political analysis without the interruptions of an interviewer.However, despite the network being a relatively safe space for him in ideological terms, Tice’s appearances aren’t always amicable. A recent interview with host Andrew Pierce, a longtime right-wing commentator, saw him challenged fiercely about Reform’s chances in a summer election should one be called – with Pierce pointing to the “weirdos” selected by the party to fight numerous seats as evidence the party is “not ready”.Richard Tice, pictured in 2018 at a 'Leave Means Leave' campaign event, is focused on the issue of immigration. (Steve Finn/WENN)Tice was also involved in an incident that saw the network deemed in breach of broadcasting regulator Ofcom’s impartiality regulations, specifically an interview in which a former Brexit Party MEP failed to “sufficiently challenge” his views on immigration.The regulator is under increasing pressure to crack down on GB News heading into the election, with critics arguing it cannot be allowed to broadcast shows that feature Tory and Reform MPs interviewing each other without alternative points of view represented.Tice on NHSThe state and future of the NHS set to be one of this election’s main battlegrounds, and Reform’s key health policy is to spend £17 billion on the NHS on top of its current budget in an effort to get waiting lists down to zero. It also proposes introducing tax relief on private healthcare – something that has been criticised by opponents as a creeping step towards the privatisation of healthcare writ large.Tice’s stated rationale is that the reason the service is struggling is because the money it needs is being spent on other things that the public do not in fact support. Top of the list is Net Zero, which the party and its predecessors have long decried as a pointless “woke” project.In April, Tice used a press conference to frame the choice starkly. “We have a choice in this country, it seems to me,” he said. “A pretty clear choice. Do we want zero waiting lists in two years, and to keep them there? That is the Reform choice. Or do we want net zero CO2 emissions in 25 years? That is the Labour choice.”Tice on immigrationImmigration is by far Reform UK’s top issue, with the party looking to build on Farage’s two decades of campaigning against it in its legal and illegal forms.As far as the election goes, Tice and the party are targeting the continuing arrival of small boats of people travelling across the English Channel, many of them seeking asylum. He has criticised the government for failing to stop “mass immigration” post-Brexit, and described Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda policy as “a disaster”, arguing on GB News that its supposed deterrent value was revealed to be zero just hours after the House of Commons finally passed the law.Reform chairman Richard Tice (L) and leader Nigel Farage speak at the party's economic policy launch at Church House in London. (Alamy Live News)“Within a matter of hours more boats, absolutely packed full, overfilled with illegal migrants, were setting off from the beaches. And we learnt on Tuesday morning that sadly five people, including a young child, drowned leaving the beaches. That's not a deterrent. That's an absolute disaster.”Instead of deporting people to Rwanda, he is arguing for a “pick up and take back” policy that would see small boat arrivals deposited back on French soil. As evidence that this is both practical and humane, he has cited similar policies deployed in the US and Australia.However, he has not addressed the fact that Australia’s policy has been criticised internationally for leaving so-called “boat people” confined to facilities on the island of Nauru, where there have been incidents of suicide and self-immolation.Tice on cost of living crisisPerhaps unsurprisingly given he is trying to peel away former Tory voters, Tice has criticised recent Tory prime ministers harshly for overseeing Britain’s intense cost of living crisis. In 2022, he accused then-prime minister Boris Johnson of “waffling” over the situation. “Clueless, out of touch, no ideas, no help,” he tweeted. “Shocking.”He has also warned that the prospect of a “disastrous” Labour government will offer no prospect of meaningful relief for struggling households.Instead, Reform proposes lifting the minimum level of income tax to £20,000 while cutting various other taxes – among them fuel duty, another gesture to the party’s rejection of environmentalism as a top priority.","Who is Richard Tice?

I think it’s up to the leaders of this country to find their own solution to this now.”Speers says she feels frustrated when she sees some politicians blaming the economic issues the country faces now on Brexit when there’s no quick way to reverse that decision. She wants to hear more about the issues that she feels directly affect her life now - and that includes both the cost of living and climate change. “I’d quite like the world to still be intact by the time I’m 30,” she says gravely.Speers, who will be voting in David Cameron’s former constituency of Witney and West Oxfordshire, says she is still to make a final decision on how she will vote. She’s in a Conservative stronghold where the only possible rival to the Tory candidate is the Liberal Democrat challenger, but she is also tempted by the Green Party.“The Green Party have the best environmental policies, but the Lib Dems are also good on that and have policies that they have actually acted on in the past. And the Lib Dem candidate in my constituency has a background in environmental economics,” she says.But like many young people, Speers still feels that the Liberal Democrats cannot be trusted with their promises to the youth vote after compromising on scrapping tuition fees and other core promises when the party entered coalition with the Tories. “The last time the Lib Dems did well in an election was in 2010 and it didn’t go well in the long term,” she says. “I don’t know how they would fare in a position of power. That’s my biggest issue with politics: they all make promises they can never live up to.”Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

Reform’s former leader turned Farage sidekickKnowing she’s a new and floating voter, Speers - who signed up to ensure she received both the Green and Liberal Democrat manifestos when they were published - has been targeted by both parties with lots of marketing information, including requests for donations. She hasn’t felt plugged into the election campaign, but admits she avoids broadcast news and newspapers, obtaining most of her news updates through Instagram, and describes herself as “quite a sceptic” about what she reads and hears.In September, Speers will move to Surrey to study for a degree in acting. The cost of living, including energy bills, which she will soon pay independently, weighs on her mind as she prepares to move out of her family home for the first time. “I’ve managed to find a really good deal for rent but it’s still a lot [of money] and I’m looking at doing a course with 35 hours a week of contact time and still looking for paid work around that, even though I will have line learning and essays I have to write on top,” she explains. “When you look at the profits that the oil and fuel companies are making, there has to be a lot of deception in the communication [about the cost of living]. If it’s getting better I’ve yet to see that.”Other important policy issues for her include immigration - she describes the Rwanda policy, designed by the Conservative government to deport illegal migrants to the country, as “upsetting” - and what she perceives as a rolling back of rights for LGBT+ people under the Tories’ so-called ‘war on woke’. Speers says: “It’s overturning significant amounts of progress that has been made already. I don’t see why as a country we should be taking back those rights.”Speers, who describes herself as a pacifist, is also concerned about the lack of discussion in this campaign about our engagement with the Israel-Palestine conflict and the treatment of refugees in the Gaza Strip. “Lots of the news says things like ‘individuals were targeted’ and so much of it diminishes the effect of what’s happening in Gaza. They don’t go into anywhere near enough detail. The world leaders in the West either refrain from speaking or are still endorsing what is essentially a genocide. Our leaders need to be willing to stand up and report what is right.”Even though Speers is taking her first vote seriously, she warns that many of her college friends are not planning to vote because they believe it will not make any difference in such a long-standing Tory stronghold. “A lot of us know how our parents are going to vote. I’ve got quite a few friends whose parents are very right-wing while their children are left-wing. They just think they’ll be outnumbered so what’s the point,” she says. “But for me it’s a big step towards adulthood and independence. If I’ve made the effort to make my voice heard then I have the right to complain.”Read more:'I’ve always voted Labour, but this time around I'm with Rishi''Westminster ignores the plight of farmers like me – I don't know who I'll vote for''The health service isn't working, education isn't working – that's why I'm voting Labour''Why I’m voting tactically in the general election'","I'm voting for the first time and Sunak's 'war on woke' is a major turn-offElla Speers, 18, says many of her friends are not voting in their Tory-stronghold area because they don't think it will make a difference",10,13
342,"The son of a toolmaker and the first of his family to go to university, Sir Keir Starmer is the most working class Labour Party leader in a generation.Yet when focus groups are asked what they think his favourite drink is, they guess that he’s partial to a gin and tonic rather than a pint down the local boozer. Many also assume his title is hereditary.So what do you really need to know about the man who, on current poll ratings, is set to be the UK’s next prime minister?His early lifeKeir Starmer was born in Southwark, south London, in 1962, as the second of four children. His parents were Labour Party members and named him after Keir Hardie, the party’s first leader in parliament.The family moved out of the capital and he grew up in Hurst Green, a village just outside the small Surrey town of Oxted. He was active in youth politics from his teenage years but was also a skilled musician, taking music lessons alongside Norman Cook, who later became better known as a member of The Housemartins and the DJ Fatboy Slim.Starmer played the flute, piano, violin and recorder and was a junior exhibitioner at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.His familyStarmer is married to Victoria, a former solicitor who later retrained in occupational health and now works for the NHS. The pair met through their work in the law in the early 2000s and married in Essex in 2007.She was first seen accompanying her husband when the couple were filmed clapping for carers during the pandemic in 2020 outside their home in Camden. They have two children, a son and daughter, but both are kept out of the public eye.Victoria's father was Jewish and originally came from Poland, while her mother converted when they got married. Starmer has said in a previous interview that ""my wife in particular wants our children to know the faith of her family"" and that they ""observe some of the practices, for example Friday night prayers"".Keir Starmer with parents, Rodney and Josephine, at his graduation. (Twitter/Keir Starmer)His parentsThe Labour leader's father, Rodney Starmer, worked as a toolmaker in a factory, and his mother Josephine Starmer (née Baker), was a nurse.His father worked long, 14-hour days but spent his time outside work caring for Josephine, who was diagnosed with the autoimmune condition Still’s disease. She required two hip and knee replacements twice in her lifetime and struggled with arthritic pain.As a young man Starmer also helped care for his mother, which he has said led to him being more emotionally reserved. His sister, Katy, recalled: “He’s had to be a grown-up all his life. I’ve always been quite open about my feelings – Keir is good at most things, but not that.” Josephine Starmer died in 2015, and his father three years later.His educationStarmer passed the 11-plus examination, and attended Reigate Grammar School from age 11. While he was at the school it became an independent fee-paying institution, but as an existing student he was exempt from fees, and his tuition in the sixth form was covered by a bursary.After school he studied law at the University of Leeds, this first in his family to attend university, graduating with a first class degree in 1985. He undertook postgraduate law studied at the University of Oxford, where he served as editor of a radical magazine, Socialist Alternatives.A photograph of a younger Starmer as shown on ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories in 2021. (ITV)Why is he a sir?Stamer was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 2014 in recognition of his work in the legal profession, culminating in a five-year term as Director of Public Prosecutions.He first became a barrister in 1987 at the Middle Temple, later joining Doughty Street Chambers and was appointed a Queen’s Counsel in 2002, aged just 39. In 2008 he was appointed head of the Crown Prosecution Service and DPP.During his tenure he chose to prosecute three Labour MPs and a Conservative in the wake of the parliamentary expenses scandal, and was responsible for prosecuting former MP Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce for perverting the course of justice after Pryce claimed responsibility for her former husband’s speeding offence.Starmer on... the NHSThe Labour leader has said that, if elected, his government would “get the NHS working around the clock and pay staff properly to do it”.The remark followed a commitment to provide £1.1bn in funding for the health service to cut waiting lists by paying doctors and nurses to carry out additional out-of-hours care, which would be funded by axing tax breaks for wealthy “non-doms” who hoard money overseas. He added: “The Conservative Party that brought our NHS to its knees will put it in the ground. We have to get it back on its feet.”Starmer describes the NHS as “the crowdfunded solution for all of us”, reinforcing his commitment to healthcare being free at the point of use, but says reform is inevitable or the health service would “remain on life support”. He has pledged to integrate up-to-date technology into every part of the NHS including using artificial intelligence to diagnose disease earlier and more accurately.He supported the doctors strikes, telling ministers: “Don’t break junior doctors, talk to them. Get in the room [and] sort it out.”Starmer with his wife, Lady Victoria Starmer, at the Labour Party Conference in October 2023. (Alamy)Starmer on… immigrationThe government has “lost control of borders”, according to Labour. Starmer has said a Labour government would set up a new policy unit to tackle illegal migration and has suggested that a returns agreement for asylum seekers could be negotiated with the European Union to solve the small boats crisis.He described the government’s thwarted Rwanda plan, which would see illegal migrants deported to the African nation but has to be put into practice due to legal blocks, as a “gimmick” and a “farce” and has promised to reverse it.Starmer on... the cost of living crisisStarmer has sought to keep Rishi Sunak’s handling of the cost of living crisis in the minds of voters by claiming that “his fingerprints are all over their struggling household budgets”. In a letter to his shadow cabinet, leaked to The Guardian, he wrote: “Rishi Sunak is the chief architect of choices prioritising the wealthiest and of the government’s failure to get a grip of the economy and get growth going.”He has said he would prioritise tackling inflation, blaming it for putting up prices and eroding household savings, but has pledged to “take the difficult and responsible decisions” to bring it down.Starmer pictured in 2010, when he was director of public prosecution at the CPS, making a statement about MPs who face charges over their expenses claims. (Getty)Starmer on... private schoolsLabour has dropped its early promise to scrap charitable status for private schools, but has committed to levying a 20% VAT rate on school fees removing their “unfair tax break”. The money raised, he said, will be used to address the “appalling state” of the school system for all children.“It’s not an attack on private schools. It’s just saying an exemption you have had is going to go,” he warned private schools who have been critical of the plan – reminding them they are not obliged to pass that tax on to parents in the form of increased fees.Starmer on… the House of LordsWhen he was first Labour leader, Starmer proposed a “root and branch reform of the centre of government… rooting out unearned privilege and addressing unaccountable power”.But his promise to scrap the House of Lords within the first four years of a new parliament - a controversial move that caused a split among his party’s grandees, has been abandoned.Starmer still backs plans for a second chamber “electoral legitimacy”, but as his party nears government he has stepped away from the most radical form of that pledge. He is now reportedly committed to cutting the number of hereditary peers, reducing the size of the chamber and introducing a new appointments process.","Who is Keir Starmer?

63,"From 'purdah' to 'first past the post', every election in the UK is surrounded by specialist jargon that can leave some voters struggling to fully understand the conversation around them.In the 2024 election, certain phrases – such as the 'triple lock plus' – have also become defining issues, with the terms bandied about by politicians on both sides.Below, we've defined some of the most widely used and confusing terms around British elections (and the 2024 election in particular).Absentee ballotIf people can’t get to a polling station on election day, they can apply for an absent vote.There are two kinds: a postal vote, where a ballot is mailed in, and a proxy vote, where someone else votes for you.At the 2019 general election, 17.2% of voters across the UK used a postal ballot and 0.6% appointed a proxy.Ballot boxThe box where people put their voting slips. The term is also sometimes used to refer to the election itself, as in ‘they could not win at the ballot box’.CampaignThe time before an election in which politicians persuade people to vote for them. In the case of the 2024 election in the UK, parliament was dissolved on the 30 May and the election will take place on 4 July.CanvassingGoing round a particular area trying to persuade people to vote for one party or the other.In UK elections, this is often done by volunteers knocking on people’s doors.Capital gains taxCapital gains tax is a tax on profit when people sell assets that have increased in value.In the 2024 election, the Conservatives have promised that landlords who sell to sitting tenants will be spared capital gains tax on the proceeds, while Labour has left the door open to raising capital gains.Child benefitChild benefit is a benefit paid to parents with children under 16 (or under 20 in approved education or training).The Conservatives have promised to increase the threshold at which high earners start to lose the benefit from £60,000 to £120,000.Sir Keir Starmer, like the Conservatives, has pledged not to raise VAT. (Photo by Stefan Rousseau/PA Images via Getty Images)CoalitionA coalition government is a government formed jointly by more than one political party (for example, by the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives in 2010).ConstituencyThe geographical area that is represented by each MP in the House of Commons.ECHRThe European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is an international convention which protects human rights in Europe.The Conservative manifesto stopped short of promising to withdraw from the ECHR, which would have made plans such as the plan to deport migrants to Rwanda easier.Exit pollA poll conducted outside polling stations just after people have voted on election day.On election day, the results of Britain’s exit poll are published just after polls close at 10pm and tend to give a more accurate prediction of the result than previous polls produced throughout the campaign.First past the postThe first past the post system is used to elect MPs to the House of Commons.The candidate with the most votes in each constituency becomes MP, and the party with the most MPs becomes the government.This can mean that the winning party actually has a minority of votes cast: in 2019, the Conservatives had 43.6% of the vote.Hung parliamentA hung parliament is where no party has enough seats to form an overall majority. For example, both the 2010 election and 2017 elections resulted in hung parliament.In 2010, the Conservatives formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, while in 2017, the Conservatives formed a minority government with a 'confidence and supply' agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).Income tax thresholdThe thresholds between the tax-free allowance, basic rate tax and higher rates of tax.Both parties have said they will continue the freeze on income tax thresholds brought in under the Conservatives, which means people pay more tax as more and more people are pushed into higher tax brackets if wages rise.MajorityA party with a majority – more than half of the seats in the House of Commons – has won the election.The number of votes by which an individual MP wins a constituency is also referred to as their majority.ManifestoPolitical parties publish manifestos before a general election, with a set of policies that the party stands for and aims to implement if elected.Manifesto pledges are not legally binding.Marginal seatA seat in which the incumbent MP won by a small majority, meaning a swing is more likely than in a so-called ‘safe seat’ where the MP had a large majority.Net zeroThe UK Government has set a goal for Britain’s emissions to reach net zero – where emission and removal of greenhouse gases reaches equilibrium – by 2050.All major parties are expected to stick to this goal, barring Reform UK.Opinion pollAn opinion poll is a research survey (usually carried out on a representative sample of the electorate) to gauge likely results in an election.Poll‘The polls’ refers to the places where people vote in an election: exit polls and opinion polls refer to two kinds of survey used to predict election results.Postal voteAn absentee vote where the vote is sent in by post.At the 2019 general election, 17.2% of voters across the UK used a postal ballot.Proxy voteA vote where a person who can’t make it to the booth appoints someone to vote for them.In the 2019 election, 0.6% of voters appointed a proxy.PsephologyPsephology is the scientific study of elections and voting and is used to predict and analyse election results.Polling dayThe day when the country places their vote: in the UK 2024 election, this is July 4.PurdahBefore British elections, the country enters purdah, officially known as the ‘pre-election period of sensitivity’.Purdah means that politicians (both local and national) and other people such as civil servants face restrictions on what they can do and announce.Ministers who remain in office can’t announce new funding, or new policies, or anything which might sway voters or make the government more popular.The idea is that public money cannot be spent on the election.Spoiled ballotA ballot paper which has been marked wrongly (for instance with a vote for more than one candidate) will not be counted.Sometimes people spoil ballots deliberately as a protest vote to show dissatisfactionSwing‘Swing’ is the change in voter support for a political party between one election and the next.It is used to analyse the performance of parties in different areas.Tax burdenThe tax burden refers to the total amount of taxes paid by a group (in this case the UK as a whole) as a proportion of total income.The tax burden is currently at its highest in 70 years according to the OECD.The Equality ActThe 2010 Equality Act protects people against discrimination in Britain.The Conservatives want to ‘tweak’ the Act so that sex-based protections only apply on the basis of someone’s biological sex.Triple lockThe triple lock is a guarantee introduced to the state pension in 2010 so it would not lose value in real terms.The guarantee means that the state pension will rise by the highest out of average earnings, inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) or 2.5%.Triple lock plusThe ‘triple lock plus’ is a Conservative policy, which would see the tax-free pension allowance rise every year in line with the triple lock of average wages, inflation, or 2.5% – whichever is highest, to prevent pensioners being pulled into paying income tax.TurnoutTurnout refers to the percentage of people eligible to vote who turn out to vote on election day.In the 2019 election, for example, 67.3% of those eligible turned out to vote.VATValue added tax is added to goods and services sold by VAT-registered companies, and is the third-largest source of government income after income tax and national insurance.Both Labour and the Conservatives have pledged not to raise VAT.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

122,"Leading pollster John Curtice has poured cold water on suggestions that Reform UK is now beating the Conservative Party in the general election polls.As representatives from seven parties took prepared to take part in a TV debate on Thursday, a YouGov survey for The Times newspaper said Reform’s support had increased by two points to 19%, putting them ahead of the Tories for the first time.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage took the the opportunity to hail the poll results in the debate, declaring: “We are now the opposition to Labour.”But Curtice urged caution, insisting that single polls should not be relied on. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""This is one poll - we’ve actually, I think, had four other polls published in the last 24 hours - none of which have had Reform ahead, not even all of which have had Reform gaining ground, but quite a couple of them certainly suggesting it’s also got very close.""He said it may not be the case that Reform are ahead - and could be on average four or five points behind. But he said: ""This is still bad news for the Conservatives. The only way Rishi Sunak can hope to get even to base camp in narrowing the lead that Labour have started off with this campaign was to squeeze the Reform vote.""He added: ""Rather than making progress, things are actually going backwards, not least of course because of Nigel Farage’s decision to fight this campaign.""With many speculating that Reform UK with Farage at the helm could ""beat"" the Tories, Yahoo News UK takes a look.What do the latest polls say?YouGov’s voting intention tracker, updated on Tuesday, suggests the Tories and Reform UK are neck and neck.With Labour well ahead on 38%, the Tories are trailing on 18% – compared to a high of 53% under Boris Johnson in 2020 – with Reform UK just behind on 17% and the Liberal Democrats on 15%.However, there are multiple polls taking place at any one time by a number of different companies.According to the PA news agency, an average of all polls that were carried out wholly or partly during the seven days to June 13 puts Labour on 43%, 21 points ahead of the Conservatives on 22%, followed by Reform on 14%, the Lib Dems on 10% and the Greens on 6%.And while Reform’s average is up one percentage point on the figure for the previous week and the Tories are down one point, there is still an eight-point gap, on average, between the two.Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?Unless something remarkable happens, in short: 'No' - and that's because of the first past the post (FPTP) voting system in which the candidate with the largest number of votes in their constituency is elected.According to the Electoral Reform Society, which is against FPTP, this system leads to a situation where “even if millions of voters support the same party, if they are thinly spread out across the UK they may only get the largest number of votes in a couple of these contests – so only win a few MPs"".“Tens of thousands of voters supporting a different party, but who live near each other, could end up with more MPs. This means the number of MPs a party has in parliament rarely matches their popularity with the public.”Rishi Sunak on the campaign trail on Wednesday. (AFP via Getty Images)Farage knows this well. As the leader of UKIP in the 2015 election, he saw his party win 12.6% of the nationwide vote and one seat. The Liberal Democrats won 7.9% of the vote... and eight seats.Indeed, YouGov last week released a poll – put together using the multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) surveying technique, from a sample size of nearly 60,000 respondents – which suggested the Tories would win just 140 seats, having won 365 in 2019. But this is still 140 more than the zero it projected Reform UK to win, in spite of its strong polling figures.The model had Reform UK ""performing strongly in a number of seats but still a long way off winning in any"", with projected second-placed finishes in 27 constituencies.YouGov's MRP projection. (YouGov)Granted, this model was formed between 24 May and 1 June, before Farage's headline-grabbing intervention on Monday last week in which he announced he would be standing as an MP.But, even as Reform UK polls closer than ever to the Tories, it's difficult to imagine the party winning more than a handful of seats.Chris Hopkins, director at polling firm Savanta, told Yahoo News UK that in one respect, Reform UK is at an advantage compared to Ukip in 2015 because ""Ukip took votes from both Labour and the Conservatives, and we are not seeing that with Reform UK – they are all coming from the Conservatives.""That is the consequence of Rishi Sunak making immigration a centrepiece of the campaign and failing to deliver on it. Even if you have voters that are neutral on immigration, they would say the small boats policy has been a disaster.""But even so, Hopkins said, Reform UK is still ""at a huge electoral disadvantage"" in that its votes are not very concentrated, they are very evenly spread.""There are going to be some races where Reform UK is strong - the Nigel Farage factor in Clacton is really interesting - but realistically its ceiling is five seats: and that’s a high ceiling.""Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey on a campaign visit in Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire, on Wednesday. (PA)Like Reform UK, Sir Ed Davey’s Liberal Democrats are performing well in the polls.In a sign of how defensive the Tory campaign is becoming, one online party advert claims voting for Reform UK or the Lib Dems could give Labour 100 extra seats, resulting in the biggest majority in its history.It depicts a scenario where the Conservatives are beaten into third place behind the Lib Dems, with just 57 seats, despite getting 19% of the vote and without Reform winning a single seat.Read more: Pollsters got it wrong in 2015, so could Labour’s lead be overestimated? (The Guardian)However, it remains unlikely the Lib Dems will finish second. YouGov’s MRP poll projected the party performing strongly, winning 48 seats. This would be up 37 from 2019, but still nowhere near the Tories’ projected 140.However, amid all this talk about projections, it’s worth remembering they are still only polls and not a definite indicator of how people will vote on 4 July. The 1992 and 2015 elections are notable examples of how polling didn’t match the end results of Tory wins.What is proportional representation?Proportional representation, as defined by the UK parliament, is an electoral system ""in which the distribution of seats corresponds closely with the proportion of the total votes cast for each party. For example, if a party gained 40% of the total votes, a perfectly proportional system would allow them to gain 40% of the seats.""This differs from the first past the post system, as set out above, in that a relatively high vote share rarely corresponds with increased seats for the smaller parties. In 2019, for example, the Lib Dems won 11.5% of the vote but only 1.7% – 11 – of the 650 seats.Unsurprisingly, both Reform UK and the Lib Dems support proportional representation.The Lib Dems this week made it part of their manifesto, with the party saying it would introduce the single transferrable vote method, a form of proportional representation which allows electors to rank their preference of candidates on the ballot.The party previously sought to change the UK’s voting system while in the coalition government under then-leader Nick Clegg, but voters rejected the plan in a 2011 referendum.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

27,"After months of speculation, Rishi Sunak confirmed the general election will be held on 4 July.The prime minister said Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer could not be trusted to lead the country through “uncertain” times. He made the economy and combating global security the key elements of his pitch to the nation as he announced the election date.In response, Starmer told voters: “Together we can stop the chaos, we can turn the page, we can start to rebuild Britain.”But amid this “uncertainty” and need to “rebuild”, what do the voters consider the key issues?This chart, produced using YouGov polling over the course of this parliament, offers an insight in the issues voters care most about and how that has ebbed and flowed over time.Compared to when Boris Johnson's Tories won the December 2019 poll, the economy, immigration, defence and tax have grown in importance in the eyes of the electorate. This has come amid the cost of living crisis; small boats crossing the English Channel; the onset of the Ukraine war and wider global instability; and the highest tax burden in 70 years.Housing has also become a bigger concern, with the Renters Reform Bill - in which the government pledged to scrap no-fault evictions - having been paused after Sunak called the election.Meanwhile, the last general election was fought - and won by the Tories - on a single issue: Brexit. Yet the chart shows a clear downturn in its relevance among voters, particularly after a trade deal was agreed with the EU in December 2020.This next chart, meanwhile, highlights what voters have considered the top issues over the past year. By a wide margin, the top three are the economy, health and immigration and asylum.Here, Yahoo News UK breaks down what is behind these issues and how they have ebbed and flowed in importance among voters since the last election in 2019.The economyThe unprecedented lockdown called by Boris Johnson in March 2020 meant the public’s attention shifted to the economy, as demonstrated by the huge spike in the chart above. The then-chancellor Rishi Sunak was forced to implement a £70bn furlough scheme, lasting 18 months, to protect people’s jobs.There was a second almighty economic shock - and rise in public concern - in February 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This caused a further spike in an already turbulent wholesale energy market, driving up costs for suppliers and ultimately customers.Average energy bills eventually reached £2,500 a year (and would have exceeded £4,000 had the government not intervened). This was double the £1,278 consumers were paying before the war and by the time this election takes place, people will still be paying much more than this: £1,568.Energy prices were also a key driver in inflation reaching 11.1% - a 41-year high - by October 2022, though it has since fallen to 2.3%, which is near the Bank of England’s 2.0% target.The third economic shock of this parliament - and most damaging for the Tories - was in October 2022 when Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng's disastrous “mini budget”, containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, prompted an economic crisis. It led to soaring interest rates, and to this day homeowners who are remortgaging are facing significantly higher bills.HealthHealth, like the economy, is another issue which clearly correlated with the beginning of the pandemic. The above chart shows an enormous spike in public concern when COVID cases started to multiply in March 2020, ultimately leading to the nationwide lockdown as the NHS faced collapse.Cases fell that summer, but spikes in the chart can be seen once infections rose again and fresh nationwide lockdowns were imposed in October 2020 and January 2021. By March 2022, likely as concerns over the Omicron variant faded, there was much less concern about health.In January last year, there was a brief spike as the NHS in England experienced the biggest industrial action in its history, with tens of thousands of nurses and ambulance staff walking out simultaneously.As for the state of play going into the election, NHS waiting lists remain higher than they were when Sunak vowed to cut them last year. According to the latest figures, an estimated 7.54 million treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of March, relating to 6.29 million patients.Immigration and asylumSince the last election, the immigration and asylum narrative has largely revolved around one issue: small boats crossing the English Channel.The numbers have risen in most of the intervening years: there were 1,843 crossings in 2019, 8,466 in 2020, 28,526 in 2021, 45,774 in 2022 and 29,437 last year. This year, the number has already passed the 10,000 mark.The regular sharp spikes in the above chart demonstrate how frequently crossings have been in the news, including some occasions when hundreds of migrants have made the dangerous journey in a single day.But it also reflects how the government has made this part of its own agenda. It was Boris Johnson’s government which first announced plans to deport migrants to Rwanda in April 2022. That policy was picked up by Rishi Sunak when he became prime minister in October that year, with Sunak since repeating his pledge to “stop the boats”.But after calling the election, Sunak admitted this week that flights would not take off before the country goes to the polls.Read moreFive important laws that could be dropped due to Sunak's snap election (Yahoo News UK)OPINION - Rishi Sunak has been in last-ditch campaign mode for so long — a General Election is logical (Evening Standard)Door open for Boris Johnson to campaign for Tories, Rishi Sunak signals (PA Media)","Three important UK election issues, explainedRishi Sunak said his leadership is needed in 'uncertain' times.

182,"Rishi Sunak could become the first prime minister to lose his seat in a general election, according to new bombshell polling.According to the Savanta poll, which was commissioned by The Telegraph, the Conservatives are projected to win just 53 seats in the general election. Some three-quarters of the Cabinet would lose their seats in that scenario – including Sunak.Were Sunak to lose his seat in Richmond (Yorks), it would make him the first prime minister in history to lose their seat in a general election, according to the Institute for Government. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is also facing a battle to hold on to his constituency, with the vote on a “knife edge”.Savanta spoke to around 18,000 people between 7 June and 18 June for their poll. If reflected in the election, Labour would be on course to win 516 seats, with a commanding Commons majority of 382. The Liberal Democrats would have nearly as many seats (50) as the Tories.Jeremy Hunt: My constituency is on a knife edgeHunt could be among the Conservative casualties on the night of the 4 July poll, despite his newly-created seat in Godalming and Ash currently holding a Conservative majority of more than 10,000. He is facing a battle to win the seat in Surrey, with the Liberal Democrats keen on taking a high-profile scalp.Several other Tory ‘big beasts’ also face a tight vote to hold onto their seat, according to a major poll by Ipsos.Grant ShappsDefence secretary Grant Shapps may lose his seat in the election. (Getty)Defence secretary Grant Shapps, who had been touted as a potential leader of the Conservatives after the election, is at risk of losing his Welwyn Hatfield seat, according to Ipsos. Their polling suggests a likely Labour victory, with Sir Keir Starmer’s party currently on 48%, compared to 28% for the Conservatives.Shapps won the seat in the 2019 election with a vote share of 52.6%, increasing his majority from the previous election.Penny MordauntPenny Mordaunt’s seat is at risk from Labour. (PA)Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons, is another Tory MP whose name has been mentioned in a future leadership contest – in the event of the Tories losing the election. However, she may not even be an MP after 4 July as her Portsmouth North seat is at risk.Seen as “leaning Labour”, polling suggests Labour are on 42%, compared to the Tories on 34%. She won 61.4% of the vote in the 2019 election.Liz TrussFormer prime minister Liz Truss may not be an MP after the election. (PA)Former prime minister Liz Truss is at risk in her South West Norfolk seat. The seat is seen as a “toss up”, with Truss currently in the lead at 31%. Labour are a sitting at 27% but Reform UK are polling 30%.Allowing for margins of error and another two weeks of campaigning, the seat will be hotly contested between all three parties on 4 July.Jacob Rees-MoggJacob Rees-Mogg is on track to lose his seat at the general election. (PA)While no longer a government minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg losing his North East Somerset and Hanham seat would perhaps be one of the night’s bigger surprises. Rees-Mogg has been an outspoken critic of some of Sunak’s policies and is a regular presenter on GB News.However, the Ipsos poll has the seat, which has been newly-created for the 2024 election, is currently showing a “likely Labour” win, with the party on 47%, compared to 30% for the Conservatives.Johnny MercerPolling suggests Johnny Mercer will lose his seat to Labour at the election. (PA)Veterans’ affairs secretary Johnny Mercer is standing for the Plymouth Moor View seat, having last won the seat in 2019 with an increased vote share of 60.7%. However, a “likely” Labour win is expected, with a projected vote share of 49% on 4 July. The Tories are currently polling at 30% – half of what they won in 2019.Victoria PrentisAttorney general Victoria Prentis is currently facing being replaced by Labour in the election. (PA)A “likely” Labour victory is predicted for Banbury, a seat currently held by attorney general Victoria Prentis. The Tories are polling at 30% in the constituency, compared to 40% for Labour. Prentis is notable for being the first British MP to take a Ukrainian refugee in her house following Russia’s invasion.Alex ChalkThe Libreal Democrats are projected to take over justice secretary Alex Chalk’s seat. (Alamy)Justice secretary Alex Chalk won 48% of the vote in the Cheltenham constituency in the 2019 election. However, the seat is now leaning to being “strong Liberal Democrat”, with Sir Ed Davey’s party polling 60% of the vote. Chalk and the Conservatives are projected to win 26% of the vote, according to Ipsos.David TC DaviesDavid TC Davies is projected to lose his seat in the general election. (PA)Welsh secretary David TC Davies is facing a “likely” Labour victory on 4 July, with the party projected to win 45% of the vote, compared to 30% for the Tories.

345,"There are three parts to Parliament – Crown, Lords and Commons. Only the last is directly determined by a general election, so naturally it is on the Commons that attention focuses before July 4. But the British constitution contains and supposedly balances all three parts, so people interested in our country’s long-term political health should bear in mind the relationship between them.Our political parties have little feel for this. One small symptom is how this election was called. When Rishi Sunak summoned the Cabinet last month to announce his sudden choice of an early date, he bounced his uneasy and unconsulted colleagues into agreement by telling them that he had already seen the King to ask for a dissolution and therefore the matter was settled. It was not right to use the King thus.As for Labour, it now has a manifesto that promises to reform the House of Lords. The context is wider constitutional change and a generalised enthusiasm for “modernisation”. There will be an “Ethics and Integrity Commission” set above mere legislators. No doubt it will be devised by Sue Gray, who ran “Propriety and Ethics” in government when she was a neutral career civil servant, and then found it proper and ethical suddenly to pop up as Sir Keir Starmer’s chief of staff.There will also be “a new Council of the Nations and Regions”, rights for the Scottish government to “partner with international bodies” (the EU?), votes for 16-year-olds and much more.Labour’s specific measures for the Lords are to force out all peers over 80, get rid of the remaining 92 hereditaries, institute a new “participation” requirement (rather like expelling students who do not turn up for lectures), make it easier to remove baddies, and reform the process of appointing life peers to ensure “quality” and representativeness.I should declare an interest: I am a member of this soon-to-be persecuted body. But by some quirk of fortune, I do not come into any of the categories at which Sir Keir Starmer is waving his constitutional blunderbuss, since I am a non-affiliated life peer in my sixties. I am also fairly new to the House of Lords. So I hope I can regard the issues with a degree of detachment.There will be some unintentionally tragi-comic consequences of Labour’s plans. One is that several of Labour’s leading peers, including the Lord Speaker, Lord McFall, the eloquent Lord Grocott (who is forever trying to expel the hereditaries), Lord Winston, the fertility doctor, and the evergreen Lady (Joan) Bakewell will suffer the involuntary euthanasia on which their leader insists. So much for Labour’s manifesto commitment to give pensioners “the dignity and security they deserve”.It will also be piquant and piteous to watch the ejection of one particular Labour hereditary, who is currently a deputy speaker in the Lords. In 1963, the legendary Leftist Tony Benn won his long battle to change the law so that he could disclaim his inherited title of Lord Stansgate and continue as an MP. His son, Stephen, however, thinks differently, and is the present Lord Stansgate. “Hereditary peers remain indefensible,” says Labour’s manifesto. Not while the latest scion of the Benn dynasty graces its benches, say I.I note with sorrow that the 16th Earl of Kinnoull, the distinguished Convenor – they have no leader – of the independent cross-benchers, will be for the chop. (And by the way, with an average age of 74, and 33 hereditaries, the crossbenchers will lose a huge chunk of their number once the reforms become law.)I note with amusement that the most significant group to escape “modernisation” is the bench of 26 Anglican bishops: it now becomes easier to understand why the “right reverend prelates” (as they are always referred to in the Chamber) have voted so reliably with the Labour Party over the past four years.For decades, perhaps even centuries, there have been well-rehearsed arguments about why there should not be a House of Lords. They should be listened to politely, of course, but it is hard to stifle a yawn whenever one does, because they almost always evade the key prior question: “What do you want the House of Commons to be?”If you want the Commons to enter a struggle for power with the second chamber, then of course you should hurry to create a new, elected body which will enjoy popular legitimacy. If, however, you want the Commons to continue as the cockpit of the nation and the body through which the country is governed, then you should stop fussing and let the Lords continue more or less on its own sweet way.Anyone reading the Labour manifesto innocently might think that what it proposes is radical reform. It promises that it will institute “an alternative second chamber that is more representative of the regions and nations”. That, however, is an aspiration rather than a plan. The “immediate” modernisations that Labour wants to get on with are those I have listed above.Why these second-order, somewhat ill-natured reforms and no real big picture? To answer that question, one must go back to Tony Blair’s landslide in 1997. For the first time ever, he constituted the Lords by Act of Parliament (as opposed to its centuries-old prescriptive right). Getting rid of the hereditaries was Stage One of his plan, but this proved more arduous than he had expected, so he contented himself with jettisoning over 700 and allowing 92 to remain, pending Stage Two, a new second chamber. Stage Two never came.Sir Keir is treading in his master’s footsteps. Labour now, as then, is obsessed with the numbers in the Lords, although the full figure of nearly 800 is in practice irrelevant, since roughly half do not attend or claim public money, and the conventions of the place mean that a government outnumbered there is not necessarily a government defeated. Its cull will make room for lots more of its own appointees.All Labour’s immediate measures, not only on numbers, but on supervision, regulation, participation and process of appointment are best seen as the completion of what the Blair government began. They are intended to set Stage One in concrete, without any urgent interest in finding the right Stage Two.Their overall consequence is that the Lords will become almost 100 per cent a House chosen by patronage, and that each new government will feel compelled to use that patronage in an arms race to outnumber its opposing predecessor. The attitude of mind is to seek out any traces of variety, anti-bureaucratic independence, or traditional custom and practice and stamp on them.The present House of Lords has been tending in this direction since the Blair years. When it does assert its independence, it tends increasingly to do so by obstruction (as seen over Brexit or Rwanda) rather than by the gentler arts of revision and asking government to “think again”. Nevertheless, it remains, if not the watchdog of the constitution, at least a sniffer dog which can detect when something is amiss.Among the good qualities I observe in its daily workings are public spirit, a lack of partisanship, an interest (now absent from the Commons) in how workable laws are made, courtesy in debate, and a variety of what is now called “lived experience” which ranges far beyond Westminster.I would not pitch the virtues of the Lords too high, but I would say that Britain could do a lot worse and, very shortly, we shall.",Keir Starmer is planning to complete Blair’s constitutional vandalism,11,11
270,"Sir Keir Starmer has said that he would not use private healthcare even if his children were ill.The Labour Party leader said he would not go private even in a case of chronic illness because the NHS is “absolutely the best” at treating acute health problems.Sir Keir has said repeatedly during the election campaign that he would always choose to use the NHS.Doubling down on his previous remarks, he told GB News on Friday that he would not “jump the queue” – even if his children were seriously ill.“On acute care, people said, ‘well, what if your child was really ill?’,” he said. “On acute care, the NHS is absolutely the best, so much so that private hospitals refer into the NHS. So if we had an acute case, I’d want to be treated by the NHS.”Pressed on whether this would be the same for a chronic condition, he insisted: “No I wouldn’t. I’m not going to say to the country, ‘I’m going to drive down your waiting lists but I’m going to pay to sort of accelerate myself to the front of the queue’.”Sir Keir went on to say that if he was prime minister his cabinet would be free to go private if they wished, adding: “I’m not ideological about it.”The Labour leader said in the first head-to-head election debate with Rishi Sunak on June 4 that he, his wife and his children would not use private healthcare for life-saving treatment.“No, I don’t use private health,” he said. “I use the NHS. That’s where my wife works, in one of the big hospitals; as I said, it runs through my DNA.”The following week, on a Sky News leaders’ special on July 12, he said he uses a private dentist.“We’re at an NHS dentist practice, but I’m private because I’m an adult and therefore don’t get it on the NHS,” he said. “But our kids get NHS dentistry and I believe in it.”Adults can access NHS dentistry, but usually have to pay a fee to cover the cost.Free NHS dentistry care is only available to under-18s, women who are pregnant or have had a baby in the last 12 months, and to those on low-income benefits.On June 14, Sir Keir insisted in a BBC interview with Nick Robinson that he was “not hostile” to private health care users.“I’m not hostile in the slightest,” he said. “I completely understand why people would go private.“I know people who have because they wanted to have an operation more quickly, to get back to work or get back to something else.”10:00 PM BSTThat’s all for today...Thank you for following today’s election liveblog.We will be back tomorrow to bring you the latest from the campaign across the weekend.09:35 PM BSTPictured: Starmer takes campaigning break to see Taylor Swift at WembleySir Keir Starmer has taken a night off from election campaigning to attend the Taylor Swift Eras Tour at Wembley Stadium this evening.The Labour leader shared a photograph of himself and his wife, Victoria, in the stalls as Swift was on stage.He wrote: “‘Swift’ campaigning pitstop.”Sir Keir Starmer and Victoria Starmer at the Taylor Swift eras tour at Wembley Stadium09:32 PM BSTJK Rowling accuses Starmer over ‘abandoning women’ concerned over trans issuesJK Rowling has accused Sir Keir Starmer of “abandoning women” who are concerned over trans issues.The author and campaigner accused Labour of being “dismissive and often offensive towards women”.On Thursday night’s BBC Question Time, the Labour leader was asked whether he agreed with Rosie Duffield, Labour candidate, on the issue of sex and gender.Ms Duffield has long argued that spaces for biological women need to be protected, and that trans women should not be viewed as the same as biological women.He replied that he now believed the same as Sir Tony Blair, that men had penises and women vaginas.She wrote in The Times: “As long as Labour remains dismissive and often offensive towards women fighting to retain the rights their foremothers thought were won for all time, I’ll struggle to support them.”She added: “The women who wouldn’t wheesht [be quiet] didn’t leave Labour. Labour abandoned them.”09:19 PM BSTStarmer tells voters to ‘check our track record’ on fuel duty freezeSir Keir Starmer has refused to rule out unfreezing fuel duty if Labour get into government, but told voters to “check our track record” on the issue.The Labour leader told GB News: “We’re very sensitive to this because we know how impactful it is.“Every year we’ve supported the position of keeping that frozen. It’s a budget-by-budget issue, but I would say to anyone who’s concerned on this, check our track record on this.”Last week, Wes Streeting said: “Rachel has shown time and again that she understands the pressures on motorists and the pressures of the prices of the pumps.”08:56 PM BSTCleverly: Farage is ‘echoing Putin’ over Ukraine war claimsJust Farage echoing Putin's vile justification for the brutal invasion of Ukraine. pic.twitter.com/2T09SPZ2Sd— James Cleverly🇬🇧 (@JamesCleverly) June 21, 202408:43 PM BSTKeir Starmer accused of misogyny over change in gender viewsSir Keir Starmer has been accused of misogyny by women’s rights groups, who said he had only changed his views on gender after listening to a man.On Thursday night’s BBC Question Time, the Labour leader was asked whether he agreed with Rosie Duffield, Labour candidate, on the issue of sex and gender.Ms Duffield has long argued that spaces for biological women need to be protected, and that trans women should not be viewed as the same as biological women.He replied that he now believed the same as Sir Tony Blair, that men had penises and women vaginas.Read more on this story here08:37 PM BSTGuy Verhofstadt reacts to Farage’s Ukraine war claims: ‘Every vote for Farage is celebrated in Moscow’The mask slips.

Very proud of our country. I’m very proud to sit in front of the Union Jack. I did it when I represented our country as chief prosecutor.“But the passion in me, yes, it is perhaps a quiet passion, is to improve this country, to genuinely take it forward. I think most people in this country are reasonable, tolerant, live and let live.”08:09 PM BSTI would not use private healthcare if my children were suffering from chronic illnessSir Keir Starmer has said he would not use private healthcare for his children even in the case of chronic illness.The Labour leader said on Sky News last week that he would not use private healthcare even if a relative were stuck on an NHS waiting list.Asked about his comments, Sir Keir told GB News: “On acute care, people have said, ‘Well, what if your child was really ill?’ On acute care, the NHS is absolutely the best, so much so that private hospitals refer into the NHS. So if we had an acute case, I’d want to be treated by the NHS.”Pressed on whether this would be the same for chronic illness, he said: “No I wouldn’t.

Rachel Reeves later appeared to broaden the definition.But Sir Keir Starmer appeared to change his stance this evening, telling GB News: “Working people are people who work for a living. They pay their National Insurance, they pay their income tax, and they, broadly speaking, don’t have wherewithal to write a big cheque when they get into trouble financially.He added: “Now, that will be many millions of people who don’t have very much in savings. It now would actually cover quite a lot of people who do have savings.”07:28 PM BSTCandidate vetting blunders were because Reform was ‘desperate’ for people, says FarageReform UK has had issues with vetting its candidates because the party was “so desperate for people to stand”, Nigel Farage has claimed.There have been several instances where Reform candidates have made the headlines for comments they had made on social media, including one describing Adolf Hitler as “brilliant”.Asked about the problems with candidate vetting, Mr Farage said: “I think the truth of it is, before I got involved, Reform was virtual, in the sense that... there was no national party structure.”He distanced himself from the candidates, insisting that they were not in the party because of him.He added: “I have had no involvement with the day to day running of the party for over three years. These candidates were recruited before I said I was going to play an active role in the party, and frankly, they were so desperate for people to stand, that people stood and then we employed a big vetting company that didn’t do the job.”07:24 PM BSTFarage praises visa system where overstays mean ‘they will smash your door down and put you in handcuffs’Nigel Farage has appeared to praise the US for its visa system where “they will smash your door down, put you in handcuffs and deport you from the country” for overstaying a visa.Asked about his answer on how to tackle migration, Mr Farage said: “If you get a job with CNN, you will get a one or two year work permit, you’ll go to New York, you’ll work for CNN.“If you overstay your work permit by one day, they will smash your  door down, put you in handcuffs and deport you from the country.  We have been completely confusing work visas with permanent right to stay.”Asked by the BBC’s Nick Robinson if he believed that should happen in the UK, Mr Farage said: “Do you know something? A work permit should be a work  permit, should be a work permit.”07:22 PM BSTReform UK NHS plans could see people paying for a doctor’s appointmentPeople could be charged for doctors’ appointments under Reform UK’s plans for the NHS, Nigel Farage has suggested.The Reform UK leader has previously said that there needs to be a new healthcare system in Britain, and has repeatedly praised the system in France.In France, there is a charge of 25 euros for an appointment for the family doctor, but the money is refunded after the patient has attended.Pressed on whether he would want such a system in the UK, Mr Farage told BBC’s Panorama: “Well, it costs you nothing to go to the doctor right, because you  get it back, and the reason they do that, and by the way, British  GPs have this problem, is people book appointments and don’t turn  up.“So, actually, thinking about it, it makes sense.”07:14 PM BSTNumber of migrants to Britain has ‘exploded’ since Brexit, says FarageThe number of migrants has “exploded” since Brexit, the Reform UK leader has said.Challenged on whether or not Brexit had been a success, Nigel Farage said: “My point is this, there were two realistic expectations from Brexit; one, we control our borders and reduce the numbers coming in; they’ve exploded, they’ve trebled, to numbers you can’t even believe.“And secondly – and that’s because of a Conservative government that didn’t even try, because their big backers want cheap foreign labour.”Mr Farage has previously said that he wants there to be net zero migration.07:08 PM BSTThe Tories ‘may as well change their name to the SDP’, says FarageThe right of British politics has “gone” and the Conservatives “may as well change their name to the SDP”, Nigel Farage has said.Asked about whether he would like to take over the right of UK politics, the Reform UK leader replied: “Well, there isn’t a right of British politics, it’s gone, disappeared.  I mean we’ve had 14 years of Conservative government, they may as well change their name to the SDP.“It’s been high tax, big state, more control of our lives, damaging period for the 5 and a half million men and women running small businesses, they’ve not even been vaguely Conservative, low tax, free market.”Nigel Farage, appearing during a BBC General Election interview Panorama special, reacting to 'Tory wipeout' headline - Jeff Overs/BBC/PA06:57 PM BSTWho would be the best leader to replace Sunak?

It was obvious to me that the ever-eastward expansion of NATO and the European Union was giving this man a reason to his Russian people to say, ‘They’re coming for us again,’ and to go to war.”He added: “Hang on a second, we provoked this war. It’s – you know, of course it’s his fault, he’s used what we’ve done as an excuse.”Asked by Nick Robinson if he meant that “we provoked the invasion of Ukraine”, he replied: “Yes.”Questioned about previous comments that he “admired” Putin, Mr Farage clarified that he admired him as “a political operator because he’s managed to take control of running Russia”.06:34 PM BSTReform reaches 20 per cent in the polls for the first time, and beats the Tories againReform UK has reached 20 per cent in the polls for the first time, and once again beating the Conservatives.A poll by Whitestone Insight for the Daily Mirror put the Tories at 19 per cent, and in third place behind Nigel Farage’s party.Labour was found to be on 39 per cent, 19 points ahead of Reform UK, while the Liberal Democrats were polling fourth at 12 per cent.Nigel Farage said of the poll: “This is now the fourth poll that puts us ahead of the Conservatives.“The inflection point has occurred.”06:31 PM BSTCorbyn’s head of policy says Labour’s reported tax plans would be ‘corrosive’ without mandateJeremy Corbyn’s former head of policy has said that Labour’s reported plans for wealth tax increases would be “corrosive” without an electoral mandate.Andrew Fisher, who was behind Mr Corbyn’s 2017 manifesto, backed the reported plans to increase capital gains tax and reform inheritance tax to make it more difficult to pass on farmland tax free (see post at 16:39).But he wrote on X: “But to do this with no electoral mandate for it would be corrosive for trust in politics … If indeed it’s true …”06:22 PM BSTTheo Paphitis: Starmer has ‘a sense of humour’Businessman Theo Paphitis has insisted that Sir Keir Starmer has “a sense of humour” in a video endorsement of Labour.The Dragons’ Den star earlier this week revealed that he had switched his support to back Labour after having lost faith with the Conservatives. He spent the day on the campaign trail with Sir Keir Starmer in Basingstoke.In a video endorsement for the party, Mr Paphitis said: “After spending nearly a whole day with Keir, I was pleasantly surprised to meet an engaging, charismatic person, and yes, with a sense of humor.“It’s always very difficult at an election to decide who you’re going to vote for, but I came to my conclusion after seeing the Labour manifesto that they were very much in line with my ethos on business and economy, and that is stability, growth, and wealth creation, and that’s why I decided to vote Labour.”06:10 PM BSTFarage: King made ‘very stupid comment’ about CO2 being a pollutantThe King made a “very stupid comment” when he described carbon dioxide as a pollutant, Nigel Farage has said.The Reform UK leader was challenged on BBC’s Panorama about historic comments he had made about the King being an “eco-loony”.Asked whether he still believed that, he said: “The King, he wasn’t the King then, and I can’t speak ill of the monarch obviously.”He added: “He did used to say that carbon dioxide was a pollutant which Ithought was a very stupid comment.”He later said that the King was “wrong to say CO2 is a pollutant, that is wrong, clearly”.05:54 PM BSTJohnson: Starmer ‘casts serious doubt’ over commitment to Ukraine by Corbyn commentsBoris Johnson has said that Sir Keir Starmer has “cast serious doubt” on Labour’s commitment to supporting Ukraine by saying that Jeremy Corbyn would have made a “better prime minister” than him.During the BBC Question Time election special on Thursday, Sir Keir said that Mr Corbyn “would be a better prime minister” than “what we got - Boris Johnson, a man who made massive promises and didn’t keep them”.Responding to the remarks in his Daily Mail column, Mr Johnson wrote: “By endorsing a Corbyn premiership, Starmer has cast serious doubt on Labour’s commitment to Ukraine, and Britain’s commitment to Ukraine under Labour.“He has reminded us that so many in his party still genuflect to their past, and display a weird deference to ‘Moscow’ – as though Moscow was not now run by a kleptocratic gangster.”He added: “He must take it back. You can’t back Corbyn and back Ukraine at the same time. Unless he revokes his endorsement of a Corbyn premiership, and makes explicit his support for Ukraine, Keir Starmer is simply not fit to be Prime Minister.”05:31 PM BSTPictured: Farage makes a stop at the Clacton amusementsNigel Farage playing a 2p machine in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex - Joe Giddens/PA05:14 PM BSTNew Tory attack ad: ‘Once Starmer’s in your wallet, you’ll never get him out’If you give Keir Starmer a blank cheque, it will be you that pays the price. pic.twitter.com/dQisL1us37— Conservatives (@Conservatives) June 21, 202405:02 PM BSTRayner: Rishi Sunak must ‘come clean’ over gambling scandal.Labour’s deputy leader Angela Rayner called for the Tories and the Prime Minister to “come clean” and disclose further details of alleged breaches of gambling rules.During a visit to a manufacturing technology centre near Coventry, Labour’s deputy leader was asked if the Prime Minister should confirm how many people were known to be involved in the election date betting row.Ms Rayner responded: “I think he should be up front if he knows what the details are. He should explain and inform people about that.“I think it’s worse for the Conservative Party that they’ve got this drip-feed approach.

I think it is very important that Rishi stands up for ordinary working people in this country who do have concerns about the potential costs of net zero.“That is why, for example, we were quite right to push back the ban on petrol and diesel cars.

If people are found to have broken the rules in anyway they will be kicked out of the party.”Mr Sunak said last night that any Tory figures who are found to have broken gambling rules “should face the full force of the law”.Conservative candidate Laura Saunders said she “will be co-operating with the Gambling Commission” probe, while her husband, the Tories’ director of campaigning, Tony Lee, took a leave of absence amid reports the couple were being investigated by the gambling regulator.It came after the arrest of one of the Prime Minister’s police protection officers and the previous revelation of a Gambling Commission investigation into his parliamentary aide, Craig Williams.07:12 AM BSTTeenagers who refuse National Service could forfeit driving licence, Sunak suggestsYoung people who refuse to do national service could forfeit their driving licences and be denied access to student loans, Rishi Sunak has suggested.The Prime Minister said there would need to be “a set of sanctions and incentives” to ensure compliance with a new scheme proposed by the Tories.When asked how he would make youngsters take part, he suggested the UK could adopt punitive measures used by other European nations.The Tories have included plans for a new national service scheme in their manifesto.You can read the full story here.06:58 AM BSTWhat is happening in the general election campaign today?Rishi Sunak will visit Wales today to launch the Welsh Conservative manifesto with the general election campaign now deep into its fifth week.The Prime Minister is set to make remarks in north Wales as he lends his support to Andrew RT Davies.After four days of travelling around England, Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, is headed for Scotland with his Scottish counterpart Anas Sarwar for a business visit.Sir Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, will visit one of his party’s target seats in Yorkshire this morning before a campaign visit to a traditional Tory “Blue Wall” constituency in Norfolk.Meanwhile, Nigel Farage will campaign in Clacton, where the Reform leader is hoping to win election to the Commons on July 4 in his eighth run for Parliament.

We’ve only got two feet.“There’s only so much capacity.

222,"Rishi Sunak was accused on Friday of a “total lack of leadership” as the Prime Minister struggled to move on from a growing scandal about bets on the election timing allegedly placed by Tory insiders.Sir Keir Starmer said: “If they were my candidates, they’d be gone by now, out of the door.”The Liberal Democrats meanwhile demanded the release of any WhatsApp messages related to the alleged bets sent or received by members of the PM’s “inner circle”.Addressing a BBC Question Time audience on Thursday night, the Prime Minister refused to suspend two Conservative candidates who are under investigation by the Gambling Commission.Laura Saunders and Craig Williams currently remain Tory candidates for the July 4 election with the blessing of Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ).Ms Saunders’ husband Tony Lee is also reportedly under investigation by the Gambling Commission, and the party said he had taken a leave of absence from his job as CCHQ’s director of campaigns.A fourth individual - a police officer in the PM’s personal security detail - has been arrested and suspended from operational duties.Mr Sunak on Friday repeated that he would not “compromise the integrity” of probes into the betting allegations when pressed repeatedly on why he was not suspending the two candidates.“There are multiple investigations that are very serious in nature that are currently ongoing with the police involved, because there’s potentially criminal allegations involved in all of this,” he said, while restating his sense of anger.Asked what he was angry about, Mr Sunak said “the thought that someone might have done the things that are alleged”, denying his anger was about the scandal overshadowing his beleaguered campaign.The PM was trying to launch the Conservatives’ manifesto in Wales, but he was besieged by questions over the betting affair instead.Mr Williams, an outgoing MP, was a parliamentary aide to Mr Sunak and is standing again for Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr.According to the latest MRP projection from YouGov, the constituency is the only one in Wales that the Tories will hold onto.On a campaign visit to Scotland, the Labour leader said: “The Prime Minister is showing a total lack of leadership.Sir Keir added: “Let’s look at what actually happened. In relation to a General Election, the instincts of these Tories when a General Election is called is not how do we make this work for the country? But how do I make some money? And that tells you a broader picture about politics.“Of course he should suspend these candidates... He needs to take tough action. He’s not even saying today whether there are more involved.”Mr Sunak’s Cabinet ally Welsh Secretary David TC Davies said that he did not know if any other names were to come out.Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme if he was worried about the party’s reputation in light of various ethics questions including the Partygate scandal, Mr Davies replied: “Well, of course I am.”He added on Sky News: “It’s totally unacceptable if people have broken the rules in any way, there is an investigation going on by the Gambling Commission and I welcome that, and anyone who is found to have broken the rules will be kicked out of the Conservative Party.”But Lib Dem Treasury spokeswoman Sarah Olney insisted: “WhatsApp messages of the Prime Minister’s inner circle must be handed over to the Cabinet Office, or else it raises suspicion of yet more Conservative cover-ups.“We can’t have another Partygate moment where Whatsapp messages suddenly disappear when the heat is on,” she told the Standard. “The public deserves the truth. Full transparency is needed to end the endless chaos and scandal at the heart of the Conservative Party.”Conservative Home founder Tim Montgomerie told Times Radio that “half a dozen more people in Tory HQ are apparently under investigation”, but that was denied by a party source.Mr Montgomerie added that Tory members and activists were “shell-shocked” over the betting news, which has intensified the pressure on Mr Sunak amid a slew of devastating opinion polls and the news from former Tory net zero czar Chris Skidmore that he intends to vote Labour for the first time.Mr Davies said he was “not in the least bit bothered about” Mr Skidmore’s announcement, claiming that his former colleague was “distracted” having taken on well-paid work in the renewable energy industry.",Election date betting row: Keir Starmer accuses Rishi Sunak of 'total lack of leadership',11,0

272,"Sir Keir Starmer has set out for the first time how he laid a trap for Boris Johnson over Partygate, luring the former prime minister into the lies that saw him forced out of parliament.The Labour leader, and Britain’s former chief prosecutor, said he knew Mr Johnson’s instinct under pressure was to lie and detailed how he “forensically” led the then prime minister into misleading the House of Commons.Mr Johnson sensationally quit as an MP last summer before facing the verdict of parliament’s privileges committee, which was to rule he lied about the scandal of lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street.Sir Keir Starmer has set out how he forensically trapped Boris Johnson in a web of lies over Partygate (Getty)Branding him the first former PM to have lied to the Commons, the privileges committee found Mr Johnson committed “repeated contempt” of parliament by deliberately misleading MPs over lockdown-busting parties before being complicit in a campaign of abuse and intimidation.Sanctions against Mr Johnson included banning him from having a pass to access P arliament, which is usually available to former MPs. He would also have faced a 90-day suspension if he had not already quit.In an interview with The Guardian, Sir Keir lashed out at Mr Johnson as “a guy who is detached from the truth”.“Whether he’s lying or not, it doesn’t matter to him,” Sir Keir said.And he laid out the specific and intentional way he set a trap for Mr Johnson over the Partygate saga.He told the paper: “When I first asked him, ‘Did you apply all the rules?’ I hadn’t seen the video of Allegra [Stratton, Johnson’s director of strategic communications]. But he was told about her laughing in response to being asked, ‘What do we say about the parties?’“So I said [to my team], ‘I think there’s something here. Let’s get him on record. Because his instinct will be to lie.’ It was a thread that we pulled over months.

152,"One of the UK's foremost elections expert has spelt out what the general election polls have been telling him.“In terms of vote share, the Conservatives are, at the moment, heading for their worst performance since the First World War… by a country mile,"" Prof Sir John Curtice told the BBC on Thursday morning.For Rishi Sunak, it was another stark reminder of the electoral disaster he is battling to avoid on 4 July, with a major YouGov study the day before having said the Conservatives are projected to slump to their “lowest seat tally in the party’s almost 200-year history”.YouGov said its study - based on the multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) technique and the responses of 36,000 people - projects Labour to win 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.It noted such a scenario would hand Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer a 200-seat majority in the Commons.Sir Keir Starmer on the campaign trail in Scotland on Friday. (PA)High-profile Conservative casualties forecast in the projection include chancellor Jeremy Hunt, who would lose his Godalming and Ash seat to the Liberal Democrats, and defence secretary Grant Shapps, who would lose Welwyn Hatfield to Labour.The situation has become so dire that senior party figures are now openly warning of a Starmer “supermajority” for Labour, suggesting the party is now focused on damage limitation rather than winning the vote on 4 July.Essentially, Sunak - who pledged on Thursday's Question Time election special that he would keep going - is facing a historically bad result.The below chart shows the party's vote share in general elections since 1906...... and YouGov's MRP suggested the Tories would win just 22% of the vote. This would be the worst vote share out of all these 31 elections - not even close to the previous low of 31% in 1997.The following two charts, meanwhile, show the percentage of seats won by the Tories and the number of seats won by the party.It's worth reflecting on some of the most significantly bad Tory results in recent history.First, there is 1906, when the Tories won 156 seats (23% of those available). That election, like this year's, came after a long period - 11 years - of Conservative rule. Sunak's Tories have been in power for 14 years.It was a landslide result for the Liberals, with the Journal of Liberal History suggesting ""the result reflected an overwhelming rejection of Conservative policies... the [Liberal] slogan of free trade was a policy that resonated with a broad audience, reluctant to see food prices rise as a result of the Conservative inclination towards tariff reform"".Another notable defeat in the above charts was 1945, when Winston Churchill's government was booted out off the back of the Second World War.Winston Churchill leaving Downing Street in July 1945 after the Conservative defeat. (Getty Images)The Tories won 210 seats (33% of those available) in their worst result since 1906. Given Churchill's lauded wartime leadership, this may come as a surprise.But for James Taylor of the Imperial War Museum, his wartime leadership was the point: ""I think the key reason for Churchill's defeat is that he's seen above all as war leader. Churchill's overriding priority was victory over Nazi Germany and then Japan.""But British voters wanted real social change as well, they wanted a leader who would win the peace and they did not see Churchill as that leader.""Finally, the election from recent times that Sunak's campaign could potentially most closely resemble is that of 1997, when Labour won a landslide 179-seat majority.Again, 1997 was another campaign which had followed a long period - 18 years - of the Tories in office. With no answer to Tony Blair's New Labour platform, William Hague's party won only 165 seats (25% of those available). Still, this would be far more than the Tories are currently projected to win.In addition, this chart also demonstrates just how pronounced the swing was between Labour and the Tories in 1945 and 1997.However, amid all this talk about projections, it’s worth remembering they are still only polls and not a definite indicator of how people will vote on 4 July.The 1992 and 2015 elections are notable examples of how polling didn’t match the end results of Tory wins.Ahead of the 2015 result, many polls predicted a hung parliament. In the end, David Cameron's Tories won 331 seats - a 12 seat majority. Could the polls be wrong again?Read more: Pollsters got it wrong in 2015, so could Labour’s lead be overestimated?

391,"“Let’s just say, I didn’t make a bet on the election date, and if I had, I would be massively out of pocket,” says Emma Sidi, who’ll be performing in character as chief Partygate investigator Sue Gray in her new show at this year’s Edinburgh festival fringe. It’s a surreal take on political comedy, with character comedian Sidi reimagining Gray as “a real hun, that kind of girl next door, someone who says it how it is”, but there are also topical jokes, with Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer appearing as key characters.Sidi, like most of the country, expected the election would be called in autumn, so when the announcement came that it would be done and dusted less than a month before the fringe opens, comedians who dared to tackle politics in this volatile year were suddenly faced with serious rewrites.Nish Kumar is no stranger to the demands of political comedy and always planned to experiment with the work in progress run of his new show in Edinburgh, before touring this autumn, so was braced for change. But maybe not this soon.“I was working under the assumption that I would be rewriting for an election that would be called in October,” he says.“But what we all didn’t take into account is that Rishi Sunak has absolutely no idea how politics works.”Podcaster and satirist Matt Forde’s new show anticipates the end of a political era: “But I didn’t realise that era was going to end before the festival starts,” he says. “The challenge is not knowing the result yet. I’m writing about stuff that’s happening in the election but once we’re on the other side, it will feel quite dated. It’s going to give me three weeks to write a show and that’s a big pressure.”Both Sidi and Kumar feel Liz Truss jokes will be the first to go. “By the time I go on tour, she’ll be two prime ministers ago,” Kumar says.Truss featured heavily in an earlier version of Sidi’s show, imagined as a crisp-loving former friend of the senior civil servant. Audiences loved it for weeks, “then it just stopped working, we started to forget about her,” Sidi says.Yet jokes about older events can work. Gray’s own moment in the spotlight was many months ago, but Sidi found intrigue in “this shadowy character who everyone in the UK has heard of but nobody knows anything about”, especially as her path from investigating the Conservative government’s misdeeds to becoming Starmer’s chief of staff could prove to be “a blinder” if her new boss becomes prime minister.Sidi is interested in “our obsession with charisma, and thinking that it’s relevant to policy”, and is more concerned with “tapping into national feeling more than tapping into the facts of politics”, making much of her material more durable.While Kumar plans to create new jokes “week on week”, with one section of the show dedicated to topical material, he’s also determined to give the long view on the Conservative government. “I hope we don’t forget that the failure is not confined to the past two years,” he says. “Stuff about Truss might feel like old hat, but I hope I can find a way to talk about this era, 14 years of uninterrupted failure and stagnation.”For Forde, who’s been taking political comedy to the fringe since 2010, the trick is to dig into the character of politicians.“A broader piece about a party or individual can last longer,” he says. And with impressions part of his comedy arsenal, mastering impersonations of a politician like Starmer could yield years of material.Related: ‘People think I’m a real MP’: satirist Rosie Holt on life as a fake viral politicianThere are also ways to reframe topical jokes: “Stuff at the moment about why the Tory campaign isn’t going well, on the other side of the election if the Tories have lost, can be a postmortem.”Despite the challenges, all three feel the election announcement has added excitement to this year’s fringe. Forde “squealed with delight” when the news broke. “Change is good for creativity, it generates interest and material,” he says. “The enemy of comedy is when things feel mundane.”A change of government would be a double win for Sidi, the perfect ending to Sue Gray’s journey, and a personal relief. “We need a new government for the sake of my show! And arguably for the sake of the country,” she laughs.Kumar reflects on the strange position his work places him in – railing against rightwing politicians has brought him professional success (“it bought me a house!”) but he’s ready for change: “If someone gave me a choice of giving up my career or this country being run competently, I’ll do a law conversion.”",Surprise election forces comedians to tear up Edinburgh festival scripts,12,8

66,"Giant Keir Starmer moving through the CityBattered by the financial crisis and pandemic, Britain has lost its culture of risk-taking. In the fourth and final part of a special election series, The Telegraph examines how this has affected the economy and whether Labour can bring swashbuckling back to the City.Not long ago, Sir Keir Starmer campaigned on a manifesto that had little good to say about big business.“The big polluters, financial speculators and corporate tax-dodgers have had a free ride for too long,” Labour’s 2019 manifesto read.While small companies may have cheered this sentiment, anyone too large stood to be hammered.“The upper echelons of corporate Britain have been corrupted by a culture in which the long-term health of a company is sacrificed for a quick buck for a few,” the party thundered under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership.ADVERTISEMENTSir Keir has sought to distance himself from that language and reassure the City he can be trusted.It has proven tricky. Put on the spot in TV debates, the leader of the opposition awkwardly said that Mr Corbyn would have been a better prime minister than Boris Johnson.Labour’s manifesto this time around is a lot warmer towards the City of London.“Financial services are one of Britain’s greatest success stories,” Labour now claims.It is part of a campaign to show the party is no longer hostile to the wealth-generating, tax-paying industries on which workers, the wider economy and public finances all rely.Shadow ministers have hosted breakfast meetings with bosses. Labour has appointed financial luminaries such as Mark Carney to work out how to harness the City of London’s firepower to the party’s ends. And both shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves and Sir Keir have sought to channel the spirit of New Labour when it comes to wealth creation.Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves and shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds, right, have been central to the party's pro-business rebrand - Lucy North/PA WireExecutives appreciate the effort – they are grateful to have at least some familiarity with the key players in the likely next government.But the key question is whether a friendlier atmosphere will turn into the kind of policy changes that could unleash investment and risk-taking, which in turn power the economic growth Labour so sorely wants and needs.Story continues“In private conversations I get the impression regulators think they’re going to get an easier ride under Labour,” says one leading voice in the City.“I think they are both right and wrong. Labour does have it hard-wired into their DNA to focus on consumer and retail issues. So I think they will back the regulators on that.“But where I think the regulators are mistaken is if they think that Labour will go easier on them on competitiveness and economic growth. Because I think Labour will come in and will drive as hard as it can for growth.”But is the lawyerly Sir Keir really the leader Britain needs to bring back swashbuckling in the City?Reviving risk taking would certainly be popular in the Square Mile. Much as the Conservatives trade on their historic position as the party of business, the executive class have had plenty to complain about after the last 14 years, first under the Coalition then the Tories alone.What began with a “red tape challenge” to slash the regulatory burden has become something quite different.The Tories have in fact overseen a blizzard of new rules: from bank capital requirements to unnecessary form filling and a proliferation of quangos and quasi-governmental bodies.Painful new taxes came in under the Conservatives. The bank levy rakes in around £1.5bn per year for the Exchequer. The bank surcharge, introduced to stop lenders benefitting from cuts to corporation tax, brought in £2.5bn in 2022-23, though that haul is falling now that corporation tax has been whacked back up again.Matthew Lesh at the Institute of Economic Affairs says this all pushes up the cost of capital in the City, which hits the real economy.“The result you are going to have is less economic growth, lower productivity, lower wages and higher prices,” he says.Labour promises in its manifesto to “create the conditions to support innovation and growth in the sector, through supporting new technology, including Open Banking and Open Finance and ensuring a pro-innovation regulatory framework”.It certainly sounds optimistic. Yet cutting red tape has not been the party’s natural preference historically, so the question is whether or not warm words will be matched with action.Many believe Labour does want to stir things up but will struggle.The Telegraph has spoken to a dozen people who have met party officials over the past couple of years, as well as other leading City voices. They collectively believe that those who are hoping for a sea change under Labour are likely to be disappointed.Lord O’Neill, who has served as a Treasury minister and advised Labour on its start-ups strategy, warns that the government cannot legislate for growth.“Anything that tries to force investors to artificially do something that the fundamentals don’t support could create a new performance problem,” he says.Labour is “very definitely” listening, adds Lord O’Neill, even though the party may not have the financial firepower to match some of its bold ideas.Cutting red tape ... while dreaming up moreOne of Labour’s ideas is to give the British Business Bank a bigger role in investment and open access to government contracts to small and medium-sized businesses.It has also promised to speed up planning for gigafactories, digital infrastructure and laboratories – examples of the real world assets which the City wants to finance, if only the rules would let businesses get building.Yet there are also big promises for more regulation, including on ESG, the environmental, social and governance campaigns beloved of political activists.“Labour will make the UK the green finance capital of the world, mandating UK-regulated financial institutions – including banks, asset managers, pension funds, and insurers – and FTSE 100 companies to develop and implement credible transition plans that align with the 1.5C goal of the Paris Agreement,” the party says.Lesh warns: “This is another huge regulatory cost on institutions.”Other industries face more red tape too, with a pledge for “much tougher regulation” of energy.A policy to “work with the private sector, including banks and building societies, to provide further private finance to accelerate home upgrades and low carbon heating” sounds like a new plan to tell banks what to do.The party also wants to create a new Regulatory Innovation Office, which will “help regulators update regulation, speed up approval timelines, and co-ordinate issues that span existing boundaries,” the party has pledged.While this may help to streamline rules, a department called “Regulatory Innovation” may well find itself dreaming up new red tape.Lesh adds: “Regulators themselves are constantly pumping out codes of conduct and guidance and consultations. It is really very heavy handed.”Civil service enablersSome warn that the UK’s safety-first culture is embedded at the heart of Whitehall. It means that Labour’s traditional instincts to regulate could be enabled by civil servants keen to draw up new rules.“The civil service is designed to eliminate the risk of the Government having a mishap that ends up in the press,” says the leader of one private sector company who works with civil servants each week. “And that is a fundamental problem. The majority want to make the country better, but we’ve slipped into a system where everybody just worries about ministers putting their foot in it.”James Palmer, a senior partner at Herbert Smith Freehills, suggests a big Labour majority may at least usher in more stability, which would be beneficial for the City. He says: “The ministerial churn we have had in recent years has been a disaster for long term thinking.”Anne Glover, chief executive at Amadeus Capital Partners, a venture capital business that has invested in close to 200 companies, believes Labour is listening.Glover, who was one of 10 City advisers on the party’s review of the Square Mile, says: “[There is an] intellectual understanding of the importance of entrepreneurship from growth, absolutely.”However, Glover is more disappointed with the party’s desire to close what it has branded a “carried interest tax loophole”.Amadeus Capital Partners boss Anne Glover has high hopes for Labour's growth plans but warns against some of the party's proposed taxes - REUTERS/Suzanne PlunkettUnder current rules, instead of receiving a salary or bonus, private equity executives and venture capital investors can take a stake in the funds they manage. This allows private equity fund managers to pay only 28pc tax on their income because any profits are treated as capital gains instead of income.Labour claims this is a loophole and wants to bring the taxation into line with income tax.Glover says the reward reflects the risk these managers take over an extended period of time.Labour believes it will raise more than £500m extra per year by the end of the decade from around 2,000 people who benefit from current legislation.But Glover warns the policy is likely to cost the Exchequer by deterring investment, leaving no money to pay for the mental health staff the money was supposed to fund.“I would predict they would lose as much in lost activity because the private equity guys can move. They function globally, they’ll just go live somewhere else.”Glover herself says the policy would damage her business in a different way. As her focus is on UK start-ups, she wouldn’t be able to move jurisdiction. However, the crackdown would lead the venture capitalists of the future to make their money doing something else, she warns. That would mean less funding for innovative businesses.“It’s a long-term consequence, not a short-term one. You’ll just attract less talent into the business,” she says.Labour needs to do more to show it really wants to let financial services boost growth.Yet when asked to put forward a shadow cabinet minister to explain why Sir Keir, a leader with a background in the law and the public sector rather than business, is the right candidate to free the City to grow again, the party declined.",Why lawyerly Keir Starmer may struggle to bring the City’s swagger back,12,11

It was obvious to me that the ever-eastward expansion of Nato and the European Union was giving this man a reason to his Russian people to say, ‘they’re coming for us again’ and to go to war.”Mr Farage went on to say he had been making similar comments “since the 1990s, ever since the fall of the (Berlin) Wall” and added: “Hang on a second, we provoked this war.“It’s, you know, of course it’s his fault – he’s used what we’ve done as an excuse.”Mr Farage has drawn criticism from senior politicians, including Mr Cleverly who wrote on X, formerly Twitter: “Just Farage echoing Putin’s vile justification for the brutal invasion of Ukraine.”Labour shadow defence secretary John Healy said Mr Farage would “rather lick Vladimir Putin’s boots than stand up for the people of Ukraine” and added: “These are disgraceful comments, which reveal the true face of Nigel Farage: a Putin apologist who should never be trusted with our nation’s security.“Up until now, there has been a united front amongst Britain’s political leaders in supporting the people of Ukraine against the unprovoked and unjustifiable assault they have suffered at the hands of Vladimir Putin.”Former defence minister Tobias Ellwood told the Daily Telegraph: “Churchill will be turning in his grave.“Putin, already enjoying how Farage is disrupting British politics, will be delighted to hear this talk of appeasement during our election debate.”A row has also broken out in Plymouth Moor View, where Conservative candidate and veterans minister Johnny Mercer accused his Labour rival, Fred Thomas, of “bloating” his military service.Mr Mercer accused his opponent Mr Thomas of lying about his service.The veterans minister outlined his concerns on the social media website X, writing: “Nobody who serves in Special Forces Support Group claims they are Special Forces.“Anyone who has served can say if they were or were not actually in combat – the ‘can’t discuss’ line has been used by Walter Mittys since time began.“Not a single person has put their hand up today and said they fought alongside Fred. Must have been one of those one-man missions that happen all the time.“He himself boasted of serving in combat missions.

349,"There is something galling about being told by Roger Waters, halfway through an interminable rant about Palestine, Keir Starmer and how awful politicians are generally, that I look bored. Fair play to Waters, who, famously, once spat in an unappreciative fan’s face, an action that inspired his magnum opus The Wall: he doesn’t mince his words. He was the headline act for a hastily organised show at St Pancras Church that was half awareness-raiser for Palestine and half rally for Andrew Feinstein, the independent candidate for Starmer’s constituency of Holborn and St Pancras.It was, inevitably, something of a scrappy evening, even after entering the venue past the angry pro-Israel protesters, booming out I Will Survive from their speakers. A trio of acts performed to a highly partisan audience that included an appropriately stern-faced Alexei Sayle. In between the deafening chants of “Free Palestine!” and “Long live Palestine”, there were some musical gems, as well as longueurs. First up was rapper Lowkey, who was accompanied by a bandmate on grand piano and whose angry, politicised raps played well to the crowd, especially his song ‘Dear England’, written in the aftermath of the Grenfell tragedy and now updated to include attacks on Starmer – “He calls himself a human rights lawyer but does not believe in genocide… he backs Israel to the hilt.”The big draws were Yusuf Islam, aka Cat Stevens, and Waters. Stevens performed a beautiful version of Wild World, as well as two less-distinguished contemporary songs, and struck the most emollient note, dedicating his act to the “most pure” children of Palestine and saying, “We’re fighting for peace, not for anything else.”Unfortunately, this didn’t get through to the headline act, who was on typically belligerent form. Black T-shirted and looking fit and active for an octogenarian, Waters and his bandmate Dave Kilminster treated the hushed congregation to an exquisite rendition of Wish You Were Here, but a long, rambling newer song, The Bar, sounded like an outtake from TheWall – a feeling reinforced when Waters concluded it with the opening verses of Outside the Wall.Rock’s most notorious provocateur, who professed himself jetlagged after only arriving in the country a couple of hours before, was on fighting form, vigorously denouncing “the genocide enabler” Starmer, and declaring “I’ve looked at Keir Starmer and I’ve looked at Andrew Feinstein. I can tell a smile from a veil.” At the conclusion of The Bar, a pleased Waters, in his element, declared, “The only thing I would feel ashamed about is to stand by being silent and indifferent, and I’m not.” Love him or loathe him, this most controversial of musicians will not be quiet.",Roger Waters lambastes Keir Starmer in pro-Palestine fundraiser concert,12,11

Labour abandoned them.”She continued: “I’ve been a Labour voter, a member (no longer), donor (not recently) and campaigner (ditto) all my adult life. I want to see an end to this long stretch of chaotic and often calamitous Tory rule. I want to want to vote Labour.”The issue of transgender rights has long caused issues within the party.In 2021, Sir Keir described comments by MP Rosie Duffield that only women have a cervix as “something that shouldn’t be said and were not right”.In a televised debate on Thursday, the Labour leader agreed with one of his predecessors Sir Tony Blair, saying “biologically, a woman is with a vagina and a man is with a penis”.Last week, Ms Duffield said she had not attended election hustings while running in Canterbury due to “constant trolling” and has spent £2,000 on bodyguards while campaigning.“Rosie has received literally no support from Starmer over the threats and abuse, some of which has originated from within the Labour Party itself, and has had a severe, measurable impact on her life,” Ms Rowling wrote in The Times.“The impression given by Starmer at Thursday’s debate was that there had been something unkind, something toxic, something hard line, in Rosie’s words, even though almost identical words had sounded perfectly reasonable when spoken by Tony Blair.”She continued: “For left-leaning women like us, this isn’t, and never has been, about trans people enjoying the rights of every other citizen, and being free to present and identify however they wish.“This is about the right of women and girls to assert their boundaries. It’s about freedom of speech and observable truth.“It’s about waiting, with dwindling hope, for the left to wake up to the fact that its lazy embrace of a quasi-religious ideology is having calamitous consequences.”Earlier this month, an internet troll who posted online messages threatening to kill Ms Rowling and Ms Duffield was given suspended jail sentences.Glenn Mullen, 31, of Clyde Road, Manchester, admitted uploading audio clips in Gaelic threatening to kill Ms Rowling “with a big hammer” and said he was “going to see Rosie Duffield at the bar with a big gun”, Westminster Magistrates’ Court heard.",JK Rowling accuses Labour of ‘abandoning’ women over transgender rights,12,0

I’ve never said that as leader of the Labour party and it is not in our manifesto.”While EU leaders are said to be determined not to allow a Starmer government to “cherry pick” its way to a preferential economic relationship without paying into the EU budget and accepting freedom of movement, Starmer said he still believed he could “get a better deal with the EU, and if we are elected to government that is what we will endeavour to do”.Economists are clear, however, that without access to the single market, which allows goods to cross into the EU without extra costs and paperwork, and vice versa, the UK’s economic progress will be seriously impeded.Dimitri Zenghelis, an economist and Brexit expert at the London School of Economics (LSE), said extra barriers since 2020 had cut trade with the EU and stifled investment.He said Labour’s plans to talk to Brussels in a less combative way would “change the mood music for foreign investors”, but that only by rejoining the single market and customs union “could the UK shift the dial in a meaningful way”.A report last week by the LSE found that the trade and cooperation agreement signed on 30 December 2020 by then prime minister Boris Johnson had “reduced exports to the EU by around 30% for small firms” and “perhaps around 20,000 small firms have stopped exporting goods to the EU entirely”.It warned the next government that any trade deals with countries outside the EU would make little impact on trade flows.Prof Stephen Millard of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, who worked for 26 years at the Bank of England, said it was clear that single market membership would boost trade and competition. “The closer we are able to get to where we were [as full members of the EU] then the higher growth we will get out of it. We could certainly enjoy higher growth if we were to have a closer relationship with Europe.”Former EU permanent representative to Brussels Kim Darroch described Brexit as an act of economic “self-harm” while another very senior EU diplomat said: “We used to be a far more effective trading nation than we are now. The cause of that is Brexit. There is no getting away from that.”Opinium found that a total of 56% of voters now want a closer relationship with the EU, with 32% wanting to completely rejoin the bloc.With Brexit more of an issue in the election north of the border, the SNP yesterday highlighted comments by Tory candidate for Aberdeen South, John Wheeler, who said at a hustings that Brexit “is not working for multiple businesses across Aberdeen and the north east”.Writing in the Observer Labour’s national campaign co-ordinator Pat McFadden cautioned against the idea that the party has a massive election victory in the bag.Although the Tories are in ever increasing despair on the campaign trail, after recent revelations about senior figures putting bets on a 4 July election before it was called by Rishi Sunak, McFadden says the result is anything but decided.Clearly worried that complacency will set in he writes: “It is one thing for polls to take a snapshot of public opinion. It’s another entirely for them to influence voting behaviour. Particularly when it is reinforced by a cynical voter suppression strategy from the Tory party telling people the outcome is known so they don’t have to bother to vote.“No way is this election a done deal. The headlines about the clutch of MRP polls disguise a huge level of uncertainty.“ Up to 20% of voters taking part in these polls say they have yet to make their minds up or are uncertain how to vote. This could easily be 4-5,000 people per constituency. No wonder one poll said there are 175 seats which are too close to call.”","Starmer’s growth plan ‘doomed’ without access to EU markets, warn economists",12,8
339,"The row over alleged betting by government insiders on the date of the general election before it became public has been as damaging for the Conservatives as partygate, Michael Gove has suggested.Recalling how the investigation into parties at No 10 harmed Boris Johnson’s premiership, Mr Gove told The Sunday Times: “It looks like one rule for them and one rule for us – the perception that we operate outside the rules that we set for others. That was damaging at the time of partygate and is damaging here.”Four figures with links to Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, are being looked into by the Gambling Commission, amid allegations they used insider knowledge to bet on a July election before it was announced.'If these allegations are true, it's very difficult to defend,' Michael Gove has said - Leon Neal/GettyMr Gove said: “You are, in effect, securing an advantage against other people who are betting entirely fairly and without that knowledge. So if these allegations are true, it’s very difficult to defend.”But friends of a parliamentary candidate have claimed the commission has risked Tory reputations by going “rogue” in the election betting inquiry.The commission is understood to be working through a list of names provided by bookmakers of people who made £200 or more betting on a July general election in the three weeks before it was made public.Craig Williams, a senior aide to Mr Sunak who is also an MP candidate, is being investigated by the Gambling Commission after reporting betting £100 on the election date just before it was called.He has apologised for having a “flutter” on the election.Craig Williams apologised for a reported £100 'flutter' on a July election date - UK Parliament/PATony Lee, the Conservative Party director of campaigning, and Laura Saunders, his wife and a Tory candidate, are also both understood to be under investigation by the commission.Both Mr Williams and Ms Saunders remain Tory candidates for the election.It was reported on Saturday night that Nick Mason, the Conservative Party chief data officer, had also been told that he was part of the inquiry.The Conservative Party confirmed to The Sunday Telegraph that Mr Mason had taken a leave of absence.A police officer working in Mr Sunak’s close protection team has also been arrested as part of a separate investigation into bets placed on the timing of the election.A friend of Ms Saunders told The Telegraph that the Gambling Commission had gone “rogue”.They said that by confirming investigations are under way, but without giving any further detail, it leads to individuals’ reputations being unfairly tarnished.“The commission should be saying at least when the bet was made. It might be something Laura had no influence over – like betting a fiver on a Tory majority six months ago.”The ally went on to say that it is highly unlikely that Mr Lee would have known that Mr Sunak was planning to call a summer election.They added: “Tony [Lee] has been totally cut out – Downing Street runs everything. He has an impressive sounding title but he wouldn’t have known about the snap election.”In a statement, Ms Saunders’ solicitor said that she would be cooperating with the watchdog’s investigation.The statement added: “It is inappropriate to conduct any investigation of this kind via the media, and doing so risks jeopardising the work of the Gambling Commission and the integrity of its investigation.”A Conservative Party spokesman said: “We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals.“As the commission is an independent body, it wouldn’t be proper to comment further until any process is concluded.”A commission spokesman said: “The Gambling Commission regulates gambling in the interests of consumers and the wider public.“Currently, the commission is investigating the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election.“This is an ongoing investigation and the commission cannot provide any further details at this time.“We are not confirming or denying the identity of any individuals involved in this investigation.”","Election betting scandal as bad as partygate, says Michael Gove",12,11

69,"Huge numbers of younger people feel disenfranchised by the political parties and are not going to vote, exclusive polling for The Independent shows.According to research carried out by Techne UK, around four in 10 people – 41 per cent – aged 18 to 34 have either not registered to vote (24 per cent) or are registered but have decided not to go to the ballot box (17 per cent) next month.Leading pollster Lord Hayward described the figure as “very high” for this stage of an election.He told The Independent: “That is what we would expect for a normal turnout in terms of people not voting. But you have to remember that among the 59 per cent who say they will vote a sizeable number of them will also not vote.”Leading pollster Lord Hayward described the figure as ‘very high’ for this stage of an election (PA Wire)The shocking new figures – the highest for any age group measured – reveal a democratic deficit with Generation Z and millennials in British politics that has left the parties not addressing the issues concerning younger voters.In particular the desire to reverse Brexit – while supported by all age groups by 43 per cent to 40 per cent (52 per cent to 48 per cent excluding don’t knows) – is most strongly backed by 18- to 34-year-olds.Among this group, support for rejoin is 46 per cent to 30 per cent (61 per cent to 39 per cent excluding don’t knows) but Brexit has been a taboo subject in the election.Earlier this week, figures from the Electoral Commission showed registration rates among under-25s were half that of the 2019 election period, while wider apathy threatens the overall turnout.Lord Hayward said: “The problem is that 18- to 34-year-olds do not identify with any of the political parties or are particularly taken by the agenda. Another poll the other day by Savanta showed how young voters are abandoning the Labour Party.”Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are turning off younger voters (Getty/Reuters)Dan Lawes, head of partnerships at voter registration group My Life My Say, which ran the “give an X campaign” to boost voter registration, said the findings were “stark, yet not surprising”.He told The Independent: “Trust in political parties and leaders amongst younger generations is incredibly low, heightened by years of scandals and crises.”He said there was a surge in voter registration among 18- to 34-year-olds on last week’s deadline, with 355,548 submitting applications.“Our message to young people is clear – you’re the expert in your own lived experiences, don’t let others make important decisions about your future,” he added.Early in the campaign, former deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine warned that this would be “one of the most dishonest” election campaigns in history because of the refusal to debate Brexit by the main parties.But other issues affecting younger voters have also been forced to take a back seat compared to those which play more strongly with older voters, such as immigration and pensions.Hopes by party leaders that the set piece events could make an impact on younger voters are also knocked down by the findings, which show that among Generation Z and millennials only 30 per cent could be swayed by the TV debates. This compares to an average across all age groups of 40 per cent and 51 per cent among pensioners.There has been little discussion or prioritisation of housing even though the ability to buy your own home is out of reach for the vast majority of younger voters.Added to the renters’ reform bill which was shelved because of the early election, so-called “generation rent” has been left without protections against no-fault evictions and rent rises.Neither of the main parties is willing to look at the cost of tuition fees on students and long-term debt implications, with Labour even U-turning on a promise to scrap them.The figures come after both Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and prime minister Rishi Sunak were directly challenged in the BBC Question Time sessions on Thursday by younger voters, who did not feel their issues were being prioritised.Sir Keir was quizzed by a student on his many U-turns, including on the promise to get rid of tuition fees.He admitted the fees are “very expensive for students, don’t work well, students come out with a huge debt around their neck”.And he acknowledged that five years ago he said he would get rid of them but insisted: “I had a choice to make.”He said it was a choice between bringing waiting lists in the NHS down or scrapping tuition fees.Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak were both grilled by young voters (Stefan Rousseau/PA)Meanwhile, Mr Sunak appeared out of touch when he was asked by a student for one policy which would help someone who is too old for national service and does not plan to buy a house in the next five years.The prime minister replied: “When you get a job, I will cut your tax.”Mr Sunak’s national service plan for school leavers to join the military or do community service has not gone down well with younger voters and in the Question Time session he suggested sanctions would be applied to those who did not do it, including not being able to access bank accounts or driving licences.A tetchy prime minister was also seen lecturing a younger member of the audience over her question on the European Convention of Human Rights before she accused him of “putting words in my mouth”.The parties claim they do have an offer for younger voters with the Tories pointing to their help-to-buy scheme.But the Conservatives’ biggest offer is to pensioners to increase the pension triple lock to a pension triple lock plus, with extra protections against tax.Labour plans to give 16-year-olds the vote and has policies to bring in rent reform, but none of Labour’s six first steps or Mr Sunak’s five priorities directly tackle issues for young voters.",The great election turn-off: the true scale of millennials and Gen Z who won’t vote,12,9

So if these allegations are true, it’s very difficult to defend.”A Labour spokesperson described the latest allegations as “utterly extraordinary” and called for Mr Sunak to suspend those implicated in the betting scandal.The Liberal Democrats meanwhile called on Mr Sunak to personally intervene, with a Cabinet Office inquiry into the reports.Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: “This is now an all-out scandal at the heart of Rishi Sunak’s Conservative Party.Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the matter was an ‘all-out scandal’ (Will Durrant/PA)“Sunak must personally intervene to order a Cabinet Office inquiry and suspend all those under investigation by the Gambling Commission.“People are sick and tired of this sleaze.

146,"Not for the first time, Blair McDougall, Labour’s candidate in East Renfrewshire on the outskirts of Glasgow, is telling a wavering voter that the election here is “so, so close”.If predictions of a knife-edge outcome weren’t enough to motivate him, many people – including some in Barrhead, which he is visiting today – have just received their postal ballots. Their votes will be cast in the next few days.“When you get to this stage in the campaign, you’re always second guessing yourself and wondering what’s that additional little competitive advantage that you can get,” he says. “The truth is we have been working flat out since November. We’ve been knocking on doors for 10 hours a day for months.”Next door in Glasgow South, Labour’s Gordon McKee is also trying to unseat the SNP with a similar message, warning that every vote counts. One woman, who previously voted SNP, says she is “60/40 for Labour”, but not over the line. Canvassers recall that she said she was a “four out of 10” previously, so perhaps one more visit might do it. “I’ve been involved in the Scottish Labour party for 10-plus years and it’s been a very difficult decade, but it feels like this is the best opportunity we’ve had for a long time,” says McKee. “People are totally scunnered with the Tories, frustrated by the SNP.”Both seats are part of what has become a key election battleground – Scotland’s central belt surrounding Edinburgh and Glasgow, where Labour is taking aim at the SNP. According to a YouGov MRP poll last week, McKee was ahead, while McDougall was just trailing. The pollster said 10 of Scotland’s seats were toss-ups between the two parties.McDougall in particular finds himself on the frontline of what could be a remarkable Labour recovery, potentially restoring it as Scotland’s biggest party in Westminster. After a whirlwind 16 months that began with the resignation of first minister Nicola Sturgeon, Labour’s cohort of MPs could rise to the high 20s, finally recovering to the numbers seen before its abrupt collapse at the 2015 election that took place after the independence referendum. Labour won just one Scottish seat in 2019. It came a distant third in “East Ren” last time.At the point of Sturgeon’s abrupt resignation in February last year, conventional wisdom suggested Labour was on for a strictly limited recovery. With the Tories tanking, Labour was squeezing them to win back a smattering of pro-union seats, including Lothian East, contested by former cabinet minister Douglas Alexander.The much bigger prize, however, was to peel off stubborn SNP votes, a necessary feat to open up far more seats. Sure enough, Sturgeon’s resignation preceded SNP travails that saw it embroiled in a police investigation over party funds, a bitter leadership battle and the implosion of Humza Yousaf’s reign as first minister after just 14 months. Veteran John Swinney, who launched the SNP manifesto last week, has been trying to steady things.“In the wake of [Yousaf’s resignation], the SNP find themselves about five points behind Labour,” said John Curtice, professor of politics at University of Strathclyde. “Although John Swinney has steadied the ship, it’s not clear he’s turned it around. At the moment, you would say Labour could be in the high 20s, possibly 30 seats and the SNP’s position as a third party in the Commons is at risk.”The most senior figures in Keir Starmer’s Labour accept the charge that fortune has been on their side, but argue it is only part of the story. “Yes we’ve had some good luck, but we’ve worked hard too,” says one. “It always takes both.” They point to Starmer’s brutal treatment of Scottish Labour’s former leader Richard Leonard, forcing his resignation in 2021. It was an early sign of his willingness to declare war on the party’s left flank in order to position the party to recover, should the circumstances present themselves.In fact, Labour insiders said East Renfrewshire, where McDougall is aiming to dislodge the SNP’s Kirsten Oswald, was part of a new tier of seats that only became possible targets as Yousaf’s Holyrood reign collapsed. McDougall says there are “two baskets of unhappy voters” – Tory and SNP – open to switching.Independence has also diminished as an all-encompassing issue. So toxic was the atmosphere in the 2015 election that, not far from the streets where McDougall was campaigning on Friday, a Labour canvasser was chased with a chainsaw. McDougall himself is well-known as the director of the pro-union Better Together campaign, yet both he and McKee encounter pro-independence SNP supporters on the doorstep and engage in polite discussion.The fall in the salience of independence has been crucial in Labour’s resurgence, according to Mark Diffley, a Scottish political polling expert. “Pretty much every poll, regardless of the pollster, has somewhere between 20-25% of people who support independence now saying that they will vote Labour in two weeks’ time, and that’s a massive change,” he says. “What Scottish Labour leader Anas Sawar has been saying is this election is just about getting rid of the Tories. That message seems to have worked with a relatively sizeable chunk of the pro-independence population.”The sentiment that Labour now represents change, the party’s one-word election slogan, is evident among some voters. John Mitchell, 50, in Barrhead, cites it as his motivation. “I would hope that Labour’s got a better shout this time, it’s the change, that’s the slogan isn’t it,” he says. “There’s people like me that need help.” Jim MacGowan, in Langside, Glasgow South, cites the SNP’s travails. “I’m disillusioned with the SNP,” he says. “Not for me.”But Labour doubts remain. Another voter in Glasgow South tells an activist that the SNP gives Scotland a voice, while expressing concern about Starmer’s decision to admit Natalie Elphicke, a rightwing Tory, into the party.Related: SNP investigated over claim funds misused to support general election candidatesSNP incumbents are also fighting hard. In East Renfrewshire, Oswald cites her record as an MP. Despite the most recent polling, she says backing the SNP is needed “to keep the Tories from coming back”, pointing out they won here in 2017. She adds that the SNP has shown a “hopeful alternative to the Westminster system, which I think most people would agree has shown itself to be pretty broken”.Elsewhere, the SNP has attacked Labour from the left over Starmer’s refusal to scrap the two-child benefit limit. Curtice notes: “Small movements between Labour and SNP could make a notable difference to seat tallies, but so far the polls suggest little has changed in the campaign.”In both Glasgow South and East Renfrewshire, some swing voters seemed more driven by disapproval of the SNP’s performance than by enthusiasm for Labour. McDougall’s candid response to that charge reflects the calculated caution that Starmer recently branded as “realistic hope”.“Generally speaking, people aren’t looking for grand visions and ideologies,” McDougall says. “They’re looking for someone who is just going to get up in the morning and try to fix the things in their life. I think that’s a conversation we have to have thousands and thousands of times.” Labour’s success here, as elsewhere, may come down to whether the promise of slow, steady, boring progress has become an attractive one.","‘Scunnered with the Tories, frustrated by the SNP’: Labour in bid to be Scotland’s biggest party",13,8

286,"State handouts offer people less “dignity” than earning a living through work, Sir Keir Starmer has said.The Labour leader said that “working people” wanted “success more than state support” as he declared that if he were to be elected prime minister, he would put wealth creation “front and centre”.Sir Keir also warned that “redistribution” alone was not enough to “level-up” Britain, saying that “redistribution seems to have also become our ‘one-word’ plan for vast swathes of Britain”.Britain’s benefits bill has ballooned amid a sharp increase in worklessness since the pandemic, with analysis published last week revealing that surging sickness benefit claims will drive an increase in Britain’s welfare bill of more than £20 billion a year by 2030.Sir Keir’s comments mark a toughening of his rhetoric about those who rely on the state welfare system. They will be seen as an overt pitch to socially conservative voters, but risk sparking a backlash within his own party.Writing for The Telegraph, he said: “Serving the interests of working people means understanding they want success more than state support.“Yes, this is about aspiration. I know our country is driven by it. Entrepreneurs. Parents working extra hours to give their children security. Young people striving for their first home.“But it is also about dignity. The Labour mission was built on the pride of working people earning a decent living for themselves.“We will never turn our backs on people who are struggling. But handouts from the state do not nurture the same sense of self-reliant dignity as a fair wage.”Sir Keir outlined his harder stance on welfare ahead of the final full week of the election campaign, in which he will face two head-to-head broadcast debates against Rishi Sunak. The Labour leader will visit battleground seats in the Midlands, while Mr Sunak will travel to Scotland to launch the Scottish Tory manifesto.Mr Sunak has made a crackdown on the welfare bill a core part of his manifesto offering, promising an overhaul of sick notes to get more people back into work and tougher sanctions for those who are able to seek work but choose not to.By contrast, the Labour manifesto contains little in the way of concrete actions on benefits, though it does commit to a review of Universal Credit “so that it makes work pay and tackles poverty”.It also promises to tackle the backlog of access to work claims and to reform or replace the work capability assessment that determines if people are fit to work, as well as come up with a “proper plan” to support disabled people into employment.Sir Keir’s remarks about benefits claimants risk opening up divisions within Labour. Several senior Left-wing figures are already furious about Sir Keir’s decision to retain the two-child benefit cap.The policy, introduced by George Osborne when he was chancellor, means low-income parents are not eligible for key benefits, including universal credit, for their third and any subsequent children born after April 2017.Sir Keir said he was “proud” that Labour’s manifesto was a “plan for wealth creation”, adding: “Indeed, as far as I’m concerned, making people better off is the whole point of politics.”He said that sustained economic growth was the “only remedy” for the “malaise” in Britain, adding: “I accept it’s unusual for a Labour leader to put wealth creation front and centre. I also understand why there is an emphasis on tax and spend this election. After 14 years of next to no growth, to doggedly pursue it is almost a new concept.”He also insisted that he would keep taxes down, saying “make no mistake…We will not raise income tax, national insurance or VAT”.Sir Keir said he did not want to raise taxes because “it isn’t fair for working people to lose more of their money in a cost of living crisis” or for the “failures of government to cost your pocket”.",Starmer: Wealth redistribution ‘not enough’ to level up Britain,12,11

Mr Sunak has denied this and told the Question Time audience on Thursday that he “will fight to the end and not give up”.Another lot offered an evening with LBC radio host Iain Dale, cabinet minister Michael Gove and Mr Sunak’s political secretary James Forsyth.It reportedly went for £30,000 but according to those present someone shouted out: “I will pay money not to have an evening with them!”A picture of the Foreign Office signed by nine foreign secretaries went for £20,000.The event was hosted by home secretary James Cleverly and his wife Susie in the absence of the prime minister.However, a number of former donors have told The Independent that they refused to go.In a sign of desperation, the party even started asking angry people who were on the candidates list but blocked from getting a seat if they could help fill tables.Nevertheless, Tory sources said the evening raised £700,000.However, it comes as insiders have told The Independent that the party “ran out of money on day two of the campaign”.The latest donations saw the Conservatives in third place behind both Labour and Reform UK.The Tories raised £292,500 while Reform got £335,000 and Labour raised £4,383,400.The Independent has asked the Conservatives for a comment.",Tories believe Sunak ‘has given up’ after surprise auction lot admission at fundraiser,12,9
184,"Rishi Sunak has accused Nigel Farage of “playing into Putin’s hands” by saying that the West “provoked” Russia into invading Ukraine.The Reform UK leader received a barrage of criticism from across the political spectrum on Saturday after he claimed that the “ever-eastward expansion of Nato and the European Union” gave Vladimir Putin a justification to attack.The Prime Minister said the comments were “completely wrong”, while Sir Keir Starmer labelled them “disgusting”.Ben Wallace, the former defence secretary, branded Mr Farage a “pub bore” with “simplistic answers” to “complex problems”.However, writing for The Telegraph, Mr Farage refused to back down, claiming that his warnings about Western foreign policy had been “proved right”.The row erupted after Mr Farage was asked in a BBC Panorama interview with Nick Robinson on Friday why he had “blamed the West” for Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.He replied: “It was obvious to me that the ever-eastward expansion of Nato and the European Union was giving this man a reason to his Russian people to say, ‘they’re coming for us again’ and to go to war.”Pressed on whether his rhetoric was echoing that of the Russian president, he said: “But, hang on a second, we provoked this war. It’s – you know, of course, it’s his fault, he’s used what we’ve done as an excuse.”On Saturday, Mr Sunak said: “What he said was completely wrong and only plays into Putin’s hands.“This is a man who deployed nerve agents on the streets of Britain, who’s doing deals with countries like North Korea. And this kind of appeasement is dangerous for Britain’s security, the security of our allies that rely on us and only emboldens Putin further.”Sir Keir said: “Nigel Farage’s comments were disgusting. Russia is the aggressor and Putin bears the responsibility.”Speaking on the BBC’s Today programme, Mr Wallace claimed that the Reform leader was “a bit like that pub bore we have all met at the end of the bar who often says if ‘I was running the country’ and presents very simplistic answers to … complex problems”.He added that the comments reflected a “rather odd admiration of totalitarian leaders that we hear from parts of the Trump campaign and some of the Farage lot – ‘oh well he’s a good old strong leader’”.Mr Wallace said: “Well he might be a good old strong leader but he’s done that at the expense of sacrificing half a million Russians dead, injured or deserted and on track to be lost by the end of this year. I don’t want that anywhere in our politics.”But in his article for The Telegraph, Mr Farage claimed he had been the victim of a “slur”.“I am not and never have been an apologist or supporter of Putin,” he said. “His invasion of Ukraine was immoral, outrageous and indefensible. As a champion of national sovereignty, I believe that Putin was entirely wrong to invade the sovereign nation of Ukraine. Nobody can fairly accuse me of being an appeaser. I have never sought to justify Putin’s invasion in any way and I’m not now.“But that doesn’t change the fact that I saw it coming a decade ago, warned that it was coming and am one of the few political figures who has been consistently right and honest about Russia’s Ukraine war.“What I have been saying for the past 10 years is that the West has played into Putin’s hands, giving him the excuse to do what he wanted to do anyway.”He added: “If you poke the Russian bear with a stick, don’t be surprised if he responds.”Mr Farage claimed that he was questioning “political conformism” on Ukraine. “The escalation of British support for the war in Ukraine has not even been an issue in this election campaign, since the old parties all agree with it,” he said.On Saturday, he was gained support from George Galloway, the veteran hard-Left politician and outspoken Nato critic, who posted on X: “The absolute hysteria over Nigel Farage telling the truth about the Ukraine war is the shape of things to come.“The establishment narrative over this and a hundred other things is a Potemkin Village – paper thin!”05:21 PM BSTRecap of today’s eventsNigel Farage has faced a storm of criticism over his claims the West was responsible for Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.Rishi Sunak, Keir Starmer, Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, John Swinney, the SNP leader, and Ben Wallace, the former defence secretary, all hit out at Mr Farage for his comments.Separately, Sir Keir ruled out rejoining the EU following Kemi Badenoch’s claim that a vote for Labour was a vote to overturn Brexit.While on the campaign trail on Saturday the Labour leader pledged a “fundamental reset to respect and dignity” for the Windrush generation.

A man who remember was involved in the murder of a British citizen, Dawn Sturgess, with deployment of nerve agent in Salisbury.“Is his answer to that ‘we provoked him’? He is going to have to deal with the real world.”It comes after Mr Farage said in a BBC Panorama interview that the “ever-eastward expansion of Nato and the European Union” gave Vladimir Putin a reason to justify war.

224,"Rishi Sunak will today accuse Labour of “virtue signalling to eco zealots” instead of protecting North Sea oil and gas jobs.The Prime Minister will visit Edinburgh on Monday to launch the Scottish Tory manifesto and will claim that Sir Keir Starmer would tax the vital UK energy sector “into oblivion” while attacking Labour’s “ideological” plans to ban new licences.In contrast, he is to pledge that a Tory government would introduce new legislation to guarantee that there would be further annual oil and gas licensing rounds and promise to maintain tax breaks for investment by energy companies.Mr Sunak will warn voters that the UK’s “North Sea industry isn’t safe with Labour” and pledge that a government he leads would “always stand full square behind Scotland’s North Sea oil and gas industry.”“We are committed to new licences, more investment in infrastructure and skills, and energy security for our country,” Mr Sunak is expected to say. We will deliver a secure future for the North Sea industry and the workers it employs.“Labour want to stop all new licences in the North Sea from day one of a Labour Government. Keir Starmer and Ed Miliband want to tax the UK’s oil and gas sector and the 100,000 Scottish jobs it supports into oblivion.“Labour don’t want to ban oil and gas, just British oil and gas. They would rather virtue signal to eco zealots than protect jobs here at home.”The Gannet - an installation owned and operated by Shell UK in the North Sea - Julian Walters/Adobe StockLabour’s manifesto states that the party would “not issue new licences to explore new fields”.Sir Keir has also vowed to double down on a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, closing “loopholes” in it, increasing it by three points to 78 per cent, and extending it until 2029.The industry has warned that Labour’s plan will deter investment and risks leading to the loss of up to 100,000 jobs, with the Tories warning the proposals would spell “disaster for Scotland”.The SNP is also refusing to commit to supporting new drilling, with John Swinney rejecting calls to abandon Nicola Sturgeon’s “presumption” against further licences and branding Mr Sunak a “climate denier”.Mr Sunak will launch the Scottish Tory manifesto alongside Douglas Ross, the outgoing Scottish Tory leader.While opinion polls suggest the Conservatives are heading for a heavy defeat UK-wide, the party is still hopeful that it can hold on to the six Scottish seats it won in 2019. Three are in the north-east of Scotland in areas heavily dependent on the North Sea.The Scottish Tory manifesto will also include proposals to push ahead with a new nuclear power station in Scotland, despite SNP opposition, increase financial support for Scottish farmers and press for permanent removal of tariffs on Scotch whisky from the US government.Mr Ross admitted on Sunday that the constituency he is standing in, Aberdeenshire North and Moray East, was on a “knife edge”.The SNP is hoping a row that saw Mr Ross replace incumbent David Duguid, who had been hospitalised due to a serious spinal condition, as the Tory candidate will help the nationalists claim the seat.However, Mr Sunak will urge Scottish voters to “send the nationalists the strongest message possible that the people of Scotland want to move on from their independence obsession”.He is set to attack the SNP’s record on tax, promising to cut levies on workers after the SNP increased them.He will say: “It tells you everything you need to know that while the SNP are turning Scotland into the high tax capital of the UK, hiking taxes at every opportunity, this Conservative Government is cutting tax for workers here in Scotland and across the United Kingdom.“We’ve already cut taxes by £900 for the average worker by reducing the National Insurance tax. And if you offer us your support in this election, we will cut this tax again.”During a visit to a Scottish wind farm on Monday, Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, will claim Labour’s energy plans would “turbocharge” the Scottish economy.The party has claimed its windfall tax will help pay for investment in green energy projects and pay for GB Energy, a publicly-owned energy company which will make targeted investments.Alison Thewliss, the SNP candidate for Glasgow North, said: “It’s good that Rishi Sunak and Douglas Ross will get time tomorrow to compare notes on which one has run the worst campaign. They are both on their last legs as leaders, their party is already finished in this campaign and the real choice for Scotland in this election is who is now best placed to put Scotland’s interests first.”","North Sea oil and gas industry not safe with Labour, Sunak to claim",13,11
166,"Rishi Sunak Leon Neal via Getty ImagesThey say that bad things come in threes. If only Rishi Sunak was that lucky.Ever since he called the election on May 22, the prime minister has been hit by a litany of misfortune - some self-inflicted - which has completely derailed the Tories’ election campaign.The latest - and possibly most damaging - one is the revelation that senior Tories close to the prime minister are accused of placing bets on the date of the election.Two of them are Conservative candidates, one of whom - former Sunak parliamentary aide Craig Williams - has admitted he did it.The Tories’ chief data officer, Nick Mason, and campaign director Tony Lee have each taken a “leave of absence” after also being accused.The other alleged punter we currently know about is one of the PM’s close protection officers, or at least he was until he was suspended from duty by the Metropolitan Police.It is the force’s different approach to disciplinary matters which have led to Sunak facing fresh accusations that he is weak, a label already attached to the prime minister by 61% of the public.Labour’s Jonathan Ashworth said: “Sunak promised integrity, professionalism and accountability, instead his weakness means he has overseen the same levels of sleaze and scandal that have come to epitomise the last 14 years of Tory government.“Rishi Sunak needs to take immediate action against all implicated.”Home secretary James Cleverly endured a tough grilling from Trevor Phillips on Sky News this morning over the PM’s apparent inaction.“Why doesn’t he, like any other employer might do in this situation, call in the alleged offenders, ask them ‘did you place a bet or did you not place a bet’ and if the answer is yes, sack them?” Phillips asked.After Cleverly claimed No.10′s hands are tied while the Gambling Commission investigates, Phillips told him: “No, no, no - he’s the prime minister. These people work for him. He can do whatever he wants.“If it were you, he’d say ‘James, tell me the truth. Did you or did you not?’. And you, being an honest man, would say yes or no.”The minister said: “I don’t necessarily know the process in detail, but the Gambling Commission is the appropriate body for this. They have said they’re investigating and they’ve also said it is inappropriate for us to comment on what is a live investigation.”But Phillips hit back: “He’s the prime minister - he doesn’t get told what to do by the Gambling Commission.”""Why doesn't he just do something about it?

We need to rally together.“I know that Boris has been campaigning and supporting and providing endorsements to Conservative candidates. I think that’s great and I want to see him welcomed and encouraged to do more in this campaign, and in fact in the future.”The former prime minister has produced a series of video endorsements for Tories standing for re-election, and has offered support from any former Tory MP standing who wants it.On the weekend Mr Jenrick wrote in the Mail on Sunday that Mr Johnson “must always have a place in the Conservative Party, including in Parliament, if he ever wishes to have one”.Robert Jenrick is seen as a possible Tory leadership hopeful if he holds onto his seat in Newark, Notts - Victoria Jones/paThe ex-minister’s intervention will trigger further speculation as to the future of the Conservative Party after July 4, if their loss is as significant as polls predict.Mr Jenrick also called on voters considering backing Reform UK on July 4 to stick with the Tories, calling the Conservative Party “the natural home for Reform voters”.He wrote: “We have to build a coalition of voters and propose policies which will fix people’s problems – be that on migration, public services reform, the cost of living or housing.”He added: “While I vehemently disagree with Nigel Farage that the West provoked Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine, I have a lot of respect for him.”Mr Jenrick is seen as a possible Tory leadership hopeful if he holds onto his seat in Newark, Nottinghamshire on July 4, along with Kemi Badenoch and Tom Tugendhat.He quit his ministerial role in December 2023 over the Rwanda Bill, saying that the legislation “does not go far enough”.He told Sky News: “It’s no secret that I’ve had disagreements with the current Government. I resigned after all from the Cabinet over immigration.“But I do believe that we face a moment of peril now because the choice at this election is between the Conservatives who do believe in lower taxes, in secure borders, in controlling and reducing migration.“And of course, I know that there is anger and frustration in the country about some of those issues, and I want the party to be stronger on those.”","Put Tory ‘star’ Boris Johnson on campaign trail, says Robert Jenrick",13,11
213,"Rishi Sunak is facing a growing clamour to come clean about the betting scandal engulfing Westminster after a fifth figure was drawn into the row.Senior Conservatives were among those calling for candidates and officials to be suspended pending the result of investigations, while the prime minister was urged to get a grip on the drip-drip of revelations.Labour wrote to the head of the Gambling Commission on Sunday evening urging the watchdog to name those it has placed under investigation “in the public interest”, warning that “ongoing speculation … is casting a shadow over the election”.The scandal has escalated since the Guardian revealed nearly two weeks ago that Craig Williams, who was Sunak’s closest parliamentary aide, is being investigated by the watchdog for betting £100 on a July election three days before Sunak surprised the country by naming the date.Related: Betting scandal as bad for Tories as Partygate, says Michael GoveAfter being approached for comment by this newspaper, Williams said he “put a flutter on the general election some weeks ago” and the following day said he had made a “huge error of judgment”.Five people linked to Sunak or the Conservatives have been identified as being part of the watchdog’s inquiries so far. They include Williams; the Tory candidate Laura Saunders and her husband, Tony Lee, who is the party’s campaign director; and Nick Mason, the party’s data officer.An unnamed Metropolitan police officer who is part of Sunak’s close protection security team has also been arrested in connection with the inquiry into bets placed on a July election.The Sunday Times reported this weekend that Mason had made several dozen bets before Sunak announced the 4 July date, each of which was worth less than £100 but which would have brought cumulative winnings of thousands of pounds. A spokesperson for Mason said it would be inappropriate to comment during an investigation but that he denied wrongdoing.The Met officer was arrested on 17 June after the force was contacted by the Gambling Commission. He is the only person to have faced disciplinary action so far, although Lee and Mason have both taken a leave of absence from their roles.Pat McFadden, Labour’s national campaign coordinator, urged the commission’s chief executive, Andrew Rhodes, to “make available the widest possible information about how wide the circle spreads”.In a letter to Rhodes, McFadden said it was “in the public interest that the Gambling Commission makes public the names of other figures you are investigating”.A gambling industry source said hundreds of bets on a July election were referred to the watchdog across the sector after the Guardian’s revelations about Williams, but “very few” of those were by people flagged as being “politically exposed”.Related: Who are the five being investigated over UK election date betting scandal?There were reports on Sunday that the watchdog is investigating other individuals linked to the Conservative party or government.Sunak is under pressure to formally suspend Lee and Mason and to withdraw support from Williams and Saunders, who would be Conservative MPs if elected.Robert Buckland, the former justice secretary, told LBC on Sunday: “Where you’ve got a police officer who’s been suspended, I think consistency should apply here.“You’ve got employees and I’m sure there’s a mechanism which could allow their suspension, you’ve got candidates on the ballot paper – so it may be a matter for the whip to look at it once they’ve been elected and whether they take the Conservative whip, that might be a way to enforce discipline once elected.”Anne Milton, a former Conservative MP and party whip, told Times Radio: “It confirms views about the fact that the Conservative party hasn’t upheld standards in public life. It’s not behaved well. There appears to be no leadership from the top.“Suspension is the right thing to do while people are investigated. It’s harsh on people, if the allegations are found not to be true, but that is what would happen in any other sphere of work.”Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the committee standards of public life, said the prime minister should be taking tougher action. He told the Guardian: “It’s right that he should because so far he has shown a lack of leadership. He keeps saying he’s very angry about it and doesn’t do anything. I would think that a minimum was to suspend them from their official roles in the Conservative party.”In the Rochdale byelection earlier this year, Labour disowned its candidate over comments he had made about Israel and Jewish people. “I would have thought that it was similarly relevant for the Conservative party to do the same,” Graham said.James Cleverly, the home secretary, told Sky on Sunday that he was “not in any way going to defend people who placed bets” but insisted it was only a “small number of individuals”.Related: UK election betting scandal: all you need to know about the world of political wagersMichael Gove, the levelling up secretary, compared the row with the Partygate scandal. “It looks like one rule for them and one rule for us … That’s the most potentially damaging thing. The perception that we operate outside the rules that we set for others. That was damaging at the time of Partygate and is damaging here,” he said in an interview.Sunak said last week he was “incredibly angry” about the allegations and that anyone who had broken the rules “should not only face the full consequences of the law but I will ensure that they are booted out of the Conservative party too”.The Liberal Democrats called on Sunak to launch a Cabinet Office inquiry into the reports. Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: “This is now an all-out scandal at the heart of Rishi Sunak’s Conservative party.”George Osborne, the former Conservative chancellor, told his Political Currency podcast earlier this month that about 40 people knew the date of the election in advance.The Conservative party would not be drawn on whether more of its officials or candidates were under investigation. A spokesperson said: “As instructed by the Gambling Commission, we are not permitted to discuss any matters related to any investigation with the subject or any other persons.”A Gambling Commission spokesperson said: “Currently the commission is investigating the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election. This is an ongoing investigation, and the commission cannot provide any further details at this time. We are not confirming or denying the identity of any individuals involved in this investigation.”",Pressure on Rishi Sunak as election betting scandal grows,13,8

Exactly a week later, the populist politician had objects thrown at him from a construction site in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, while riding on an open top deck of a campaign bus.While Farage was unharmed, he told ITV News after the first incident that being pelted in the face by a stranger with an unknown liquid was nonetheless ""quite frightening"".What security do MPs receive and how much does it cost?MPs from across the political spectrum have reported serious threats to their security, with the volume of such cases increasing over the past decade, according to the Institute for Government think tank.Data published by the Metropolitan Police showed the number of alleged crimes against MPs in London had risen from 151 in 2017 to 342 in 2018 – an increase of 126%, while a BBC survey in 2019 found that over 60% of MPs who responded had reported threats to police in the previous year.All MPs are advised to take routine security measures, while others may receive ""enhanced"" or ""further"" security measures in response to individual circumstances, particularly if police have recommended them.Until April 2023, both forms of measures were funded by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), which sets and regulates the payment of MPs’ pay, pensions and business costs.However, since April 2023, routine security measures are funded via accommodation and office cost expenses that MPs can claim from IPSA, while the House of Commons itself pays for further security measures.As for how much it costs, the best available data we have is from before the changes to the rules in April 2023, based on IPSA's security assistance budget.It says that in 2022/23, total spending was £3.3m, which was slightly lower than the £4.4m paid in 2020/21 and 2021/22, but was still 80 times higher than the amount spent in 2010/11.In early 2016, following threats made to MPs over Parliamentary debates on military action in Syria, the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) recommended that all MPs adopt a package of security measures.Concerns continued to rise from then, with the murder of Jo Cox in June 2016, followed by a terror attack outside the Houses of Parliament in March 2017, with funding rising significantly since then.In February 2024 the government announced a £31m package aimed at boosting MPs' security, with prime minister Rishi Sunak claiming there is a ""growing consensus that mob rule is replacing democratic rule"".The government has said that this money will be used to ensure that all elected representatives and election candidates will have a named contact in the police with whom to discuss security matters.It says the funding package will be used to enhance police capabilities, boost private sector security provisions for those facing a higher risk and to increase cyber security advice to locally elected representatives.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

275,"Sir Keir Starmer is set to appoint dozens of new peers within weeks of taking office in an attempt to push through his policies.Senior figures, led by Sue Gray, the Labour leader’s chief of staff, have drawn up a list of candidates to fill the party benches and ensure it would be able to implement its legislative programme if it were to win on July 4, the Guardian reported.The Tories have 104 more peers than Labour, and without such an adjustment it could make it harder for Sir Keir to get his policies through.The party also wants to increase the representation of women in the upper chamber, where fewer than one-third of members are female.There are now 171 Labour peers, of whom about 130 reliably turn up to vote on a day-to-day basis. The Conservatives have 275 peers, the Liberal Democrats 79, and 180 peers are non-aligned.It means that unless Sir Keir appoints about 100 peers, the Tories will outnumber Labour in the upper chamber.Such a move will significantly increase the cost of the House of Lords to the taxpayer because peers can claim a daily attendance allowance of £361.Sir Keir Starmer is set to appoint dozens of new peers within weeks of taking office in an attempt to push through his policies - ANDY BUCHANAN/AFPThe plan comes despite Sir Keir’s pledge to eventually abolish the second chamber and replace it with a more democratic body.The Labour leader’s advisers and shadow ministers have successfully argued he needs to make the appointments in the short term.Several women currently outside politics are being lined up for peerages so they can also serve as ministers in a Labour government.“Sue Gray has the pen on the list,” a senior party figure said. Morgan McSweeney, the campaign director, is also closely involved.Thangam Debbonaire, the shadow culture secretary who faces a challenge from the Greens in Bristol, could be given a place in the Lords if she loses.Retiring MPs such as Margaret Beckett, 81, Margaret Hodge, 79 and Harriet Harman, 73, have been tipped for peerages in the dissolution list.A Labour source said: “The general election is far from over, there are still two weeks to go and the focus in Labour HQ is still firmly on the election campaign, not on handing out jobs.“Labour’s manifesto clearly sets out Labour’s long-term commitment to replacing the House of Lords with an alternative second chamber, and any proposals would be consulted on.”",Keir Starmer to appoint dozens of peers within weeks of taking office,13,11

Nobody ‘poked the bear with a stick’.“The people of Ukraine voted overwhelmingly in 1991 to be a sovereign and independent country.“They were perfectly entitled to seek both Nato and EU membership.

I know our country is driven by it. Entrepreneurs. Parents working extra hours to give their children security. Young people striving for their first home.“But it is also about dignity.

65,"Future Fund, championed by Rishi Sunak when he was chancellor, has long faced questions about its profitability - PA/Benjamin CremelRishi Sunak’s Covid start-up fund has pushed dozens of companies into liquidation in an attempt to recover taxpayer loans.The Future Fund has issued winding up petitions to 32 companies that it backed during the pandemic, according to court records.In many cases it has resulted in the business being ordered to cease trading by courts and the company wound up without the fund recouping its investment.The Future Fund was championed by Mr Sunak in 2020 when he was chancellor as a way to support loss-making start-ups during the pandemic, but has faced questions about whether it would make a profit.ADVERTISEMENTIt lent £1.1 billion to 1,191 companies on three-year terms, with the loans converting into shares when the businesses raised a “follow-on” investment. If the companies did not raise further investment they were required to repay the loans back double and with interest.With the loans now maturing, the fund has taken some companies to court to recover investments of up to £5 million, issuing winding-up petitions – an attempt to force a company into compulsory liquidation.Of 32 cases since the end of 2022, 23 taxpayer-backed companies have been placed into administration or liquidated.They included AiSolve, a virtual reality company that owed £11.4 million; the investment app Dabbl; and companies supported by Nova Group, a start-up investment business backed by former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy.A spokesman for the British Business Bank, which operates the fund, said it had “a duty to protect the interests of taxpayers”. The bank said it had granted extensions to the majority of companies that requested them rather than demand repayment.Sir Terry Leahy's investment group supported some of those companies that have been placed into administration or liquidated - Andrew Crowley“Of the companies with loans outstanding at their maturity date not every company has applied for an extension,” a BBB spokesman said. “Of those that have applied for a loan extension, not all applications have been successful.“We have a duty to protect the interests of taxpayers. When companies get to the maturity date and their loans remain outstanding, we will take steps to recover funds, which may include seeking to wind up companies. We will work with liquidators to assist their investigations and their efforts to recover assets for creditors.”At the end of March, the Future Fund had converted 712 loans into stakes in companies, and 211 loans were outstanding. A total 202 companies have become insolvent, while 66 have resulted in cash returns for the fund. Last year, the BBB said the fund had lost £289 million on a fair value basis.",Rishi Sunak’s startup fund pulls the plug on dozens of companies,13,11
110,"Labour appears poised to win a historic election victory on 4 July. In the series Life under Labour, we look at Keir Starmer’s five key political missions, and ask what is at stake and whether he can deliver the change the country is crying out for.* * *“We have no space for ourselves, no space to think – and particularly for my children it’s a real struggle.” Before Keir Starmer launched Labour’s manifesto in Manchester this month, Daniel, a father from east London, took to the same stage to share his experiences of bringing up two children in a one-bed flat.“To say we find it difficult is an understatement,” he said, going on to praise “Keir’s plan to build a lot more homes”.Rachel Reeves’s fierce caution on tax and spend is perhaps the best known aspect of Labour’s mission to kickstart the economy. But the prominence of Daniel’s story in Labour’s pitch underlines the importance of another key element of the party’s economic plans: unblocking the UK’s notoriously sluggish planning system.Labour has claimed it will ensure that 1.5m homes are built over the next five years. But how significant are these plans, and what difference could they make to achieving the goal of economic growth – and to improving life for Britons at the sharp end of the housing crisis?Ant Breach, a housing and planning expert at thinktank the Centre for Cities, says getting housebuilding plans right would be good for growth. “If you’re a government looking to improve economic growth, then changing the planning system is by far the easiest route you can pick.“Partly, if there’s more housebuilding, there’s more construction jobs, there’s greater ability to absorb investment – but also it’s about increasing disposable income after housing costs; it means there’s more money in people’s pockets.“If we can help people live closer to city centres in particular – a reasonable commute away, rather than all congested on the roads or on public transport – then that’s a long-term and permanent productivity boost, even beyond the short-term rush of a construction boom.”The scale of the housing crisis in the UK may be familiar, but that doesn’t make it any less staggering. In its most recent quarterly update on the sector, the Resolution Foundation thinktank pointed out that dwellings in the UK are smaller, older and cost us more of our income than in most comparable countries.The inveterately careful Starmer has reached for unusually combative language when it comes to tackling the issue, promising in last year’s party conference speech to “bulldoze through” the UK’s “restrictive planning system” and even challenging the taboo of building on the green belt.Since the mid-1950s, when the Conservative housing minister, Duncan Sandys, issued historic planning guidance aimed at limiting the sprawl of cities, the country’s green belt – or more accurately, green belts – have rarely been questioned by politicians.But Labour wants to allow local authorities to earmark more green-belt land for homes, beginning with brownfield sites and then a new category of “grey belt” – pockets of green-belt land that are not nature-rich and beautiful, but scrubby and unloved.“Hopefully, it’s the beginning of a sensible conversation about what’s the purpose of the green belt and how restrictive should it be,” says Breach.Related: England’s green belt can’t stay entirely untouched for ever, building design tsar saysThe green-belt plans are part of a battery of Labour planning policies that also include reintroducing mandatory local housing targets scrapped by the Tories, giving planning powers to combined authorities, and publishing new design codes, to try to raise the quality of what gets built.The party has promised to fund 300 new planning officers to try to beef up councils’ resources – and crucially, review the system of “hope value”, which can mean landowners are paid well above the market rate for a plot, on the basis of what it might one day be worth with planning permission.The party also says it will quickly establish an independent taskforce to lead the job of identifying the right sites for several new towns, with the ambitious aim of delivering homes on some of these sites by the end of a single five-year parliamentary term.This is one of many areas where the new government, if Labour gets into power as expected, is likely to draw on an army of broadly progressive policy experts and industry leaders who have sat out the Tory years and are ready to get stuck in.Freddie Poser, a spokesperson for the campaign group PricedOut, said: “You need to get going very quickly if you want to deliver new towns, but it is definitely possible, especially if you prioritise places where there is existing transport infrastructure which could be upgraded without having to build it from scratch.”As well as housing, Starmer has talked about his government making it easier to win planning consent for key infrastructure, and for businesses to expand: part of the prospectus for “wealth creation” he repeatedly referred to in Manchester.As with industrial strategy – another plank of the economic mission – Labour’s approach appears set to be unashamedly interventionist.Related: Change? If only. Labour’s housing plans are built on flimsy foundations, fantasies and fudgeOn housing, the political calculation is that the crisis has become so severe that the risks of infuriating local opponents of new development are outweighed by the potential gains in being seen to tackle the issue.Recent YouGov polling pointed to a sharp increase in voter concern about housing. More than a third of 18--24-year-olds, and more than a quarter of 25-49-year-olds identified it as one of the top three issues facing the country.Poser agrees with the idea that it will be a political benefit if the party gets housebuilding right – but underlines the urgency needed.“If they are successful, they will be rewarded with dividends from voters who see a party that is finally serious about building homes. But the flipside of that is, five years is obviously not a huge amount of time to get that started.”Not everyone in Labour, however, is convinced that the politics of housebuilding has swung as far against nimbyism as Starmer and his colleagues clearly hope.After the leader’s “bulldozing” conference speech, one senior party adviser privately expressed astonishment that this was the particular fight with some voters that Starmer was prepared to pick (and not, say, the argument over a wealth tax).They recalled knocking on doors in a recently built housing estate where residents were up in arms about the potential for another new development up the road. Such concerns are likely to be amplified if Labour wins a large number of seats in areas earmarked for rapid housing expansion – and hopes to hold on to them.But given the prominence of housing in the campaign, a Labour government appears unlikely to face backbench opposition of the kind that scuppered Conservative plans to overhaul the planning system three years ago.Indeed, as the shadow housing minister, Matthew Pennycook, made clear in a round of interviews on Thursday, many of the changes Labour plans to make can be implemented without new legislation.Labour insiders say that with the groundwork already prepared, this process can begin immediately after the election on 4 July, through a blitz of ministerial statements and statutory instruments.The mood among longtime housing campaigners is of guarded optimism: they appreciate the gung-ho rhetoric, but as in so many other areas of Labour’s pitch, wonder whether the party will put sufficient resources behind it.Charles Trew, the head of policy at Shelter, says it is “genuinely affordable” socially rented housing that matters, after a long period in which local authority homes have been sold off through right to buy and not replaced. “We have lost 260,000 social rented homes since 2010,” he says.Labour has not promised an increase in funding for the Affordable Homes Programme, which backs building projects, instead leaning on the idea that private-sector housebuilders can be pressed into including more affordable property in developments.As Angela Rayner, the shadow communities secretary, has put it: “Developers have been let off the hook and for too long allowed to wriggle out of their responsibilities to provide new social and affordable homes. Labour will robustly hold them to account.”Trew welcomed the fact that Rayner had promised “the biggest boost to affordable, social and council housing for a generation”, but pointed out that Labour had given no specific target for social homes. “It would be great to see a number, and the funding to deliver it.”Without a plan for a significant increase in taxpayer-funded housing, Labour will be reliant on developers, who are in turn subject to the whims of the markets – as with other areas of its programme, such as the “green prosperity plan”, which require a heavy injection of private-sector capital.Breach suggests reform more radical than anything Labour has yet proposed would be the best way to achieve its goals: a zoning system, in which areas are earmarked as ripe for development, and the presumption is then in favour of permission being granted. This was the approach mooted by Robert Jenrick when he was housing secretary but killed off by Tory MPs.“Our system is very dysfunctional, very discretionary, relative to that of other countries,” Breach says.Ryan Shorthouse, chair of the centre-right thinktank Bright Blue, who has previously lamented the Conservatives’ failure to tackle housing affordability, agreed that something akin to zoning may be necessary for Labour to meet its ambitious promises – but confessed himself “excited” about the prospect for change. “At the end of the day, a lot of it is about politics. Everything’s going to change after this election, and the whole tone of the debate will be different,” he says.",Labour plans to build 1.5m homes.

I think not,” he said.Asked whether he thought the PM should suspend those involved, he said: “I do.”And former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng told GB News: “It’s childish and incredibly stupid. How did they think they wouldn’t be caught?” He pointed the finger at Mr Sunak, saying he is in charge so is “ultimately responsible”.He went on: “Sometimes it might be unfair, maybe he didn’t know what was going on, but as the leader of an organisation, your character, your job is to impose some sort of discipline on the institution, and if things go wrong – I know it’s an old-fashioned view, and people don’t really subscribe to it any more, but ultimately I think the leader bears responsibility for what’s going on.”After a day of silence from the prime minister, Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper told The Independent: “Rishi Sunak must personally intervene to order a Cabinet Office inquiry and suspend all those under investigation by the Gambling Commission.Pat McFadden has urged the Gambling Commission to name those being investigated (PA Wire)“People are sick and tired of this sleaze. Day by day, hour by hour, the Conservative government mire themselves in more of it.”In his damning letter to the Gambling Commission, Mr McFadden said: “With postal ballots already being sent out, many millions of people will be casting their vote this week. They deserve to have all relevant facts about this scandal at their disposal when doing so.“I believe it is in the public interest that the Gambling Commission makes public the names of other figures you are investigating relating to this matter. There will be particular interest in whether any government ministers bet on the date of the election before it was called.”The Independent has revealed that an unnamed cabinet minister is believed to be among several figures being investigated, with numerous senior Tories ruling themselves out including Grant Shapps, Penny Mordaunt, James Cleverly, Mark Harper and Mr Gove.Former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has laid the blame at Rishi Sunak’s door (PA)Over the weekend, the Conservative Party’s chief data officer Nick Mason became the latest figure to be placed under investigation by the Gambling Commission.He is the fourth named figure close to the party leadership to come under investigation by the gambling watchdog for allegedly betting on the timing of the election before the date had been announced.The latest allegations were published by The Sunday Times, which claimed that dozens of bets had been placed by Mr Mason with potential winnings worth thousands of pounds.Mr Gove said: “The perception that we operate outside the rules that we set for others – that was damaging at the time of Partygate and is damaging here.“If you’re in a privileged position, [close] to the prime minister, at the heart of a political operation, and you use inside information to make additional money for yourself, that’s just not acceptable. So if these allegations are true, it’s very difficult to defend.”Home secretary Mr Cleverly said he would not defend any Tories found to have placed bets, but that it was a matter for the Gambling Commission to investigate.He said: “My understanding is that it is a small number of individuals” involved, adding: “There is an investigation by the Gambling Commission, and we have been told very, very clearly that we are not to discuss the investigations.”Several reports suggested that the commission was investigating “many more” individuals and had widened its inquiry to include potential bets by family and friends of those connected to the party.An industry source told The Independent that the Gambling Commission had asked for details of all the bets made on a July election after 1 May, and that it is now “combing through the data and picking off people from that”.The revelations are a fresh blow to Rishi Sunak’s hopes of getting the Tory election campaign on track, after three other Conservative figures were caught up in the scandal.Craig Williams, Mr Sunak’s parliamentary private secretary, who is standing in Montgomeryshire, was the first Tory candidate to be publicly linked to the betting scandal.Laura Saunders, who has worked for the Tories since 2015 and is standing in Bristol North West, and her husband Tony Lee, director of campaigning, are both being investigated.Shadow education secretary Ms Phillipson described “genuine disgust” among voters over the general election betting.She told the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: “People across the country will place bets, but I think there is genuine disgust amongst so many voters that what we’re seeing here is pretty shocking behaviour.“Rishi Sunak promised us that his government would be different; he hasn’t acted against candidates concerned, he should suspend them, and – as Michael Gove has said – this just reminds people of the worst excesses of the Conservatives over the last 14 years.”",Senior Tories turn on Rishi Sunak over failure to get a grip on election betting scandal,13,9

As Sunak’s parliamentary private secretary in the last parliament, Williams helped the prime minister to manage relations with MPs.When the Guardian revealed on 12 June that Williams had placed a £100 bet on there being a July election three days before Sunak announced the date in May, Williams admitted having a “flutter” on the election and said one of his betting accounts was the subject of inquiries by the Gambling Commission.The next day he apologised for the bet, which had odds of 5-1, meaning he could have made £500, and conceded that he had made a “huge error of judgment”. He has refused to answer questions about whether he was privy to inside information before placing the bet.Police protection officerThe only person to have so far faced disciplinary action over the scandal is an unnamed Metropolitan police officer who is part of Sunak’s close protection security team. The officer was arrested on 17 June for the alleged offence of misconduct in public office, after the force was contacted by the Gambling Commission.When the matter was referred to the Met’s directorate of professional standards and the police watchdog, the officer was also removed from operational duties.

A spokesman for the official told the paper that he denied wrongdoing.What are the rules for MPs and others on betting with inside knowledge?Using confidential information to gain an unfair advantage when betting may constitute a criminal offence.Gamblers are not allowed to use inside information to place a bet or to instruct someone else to do so on their behalf.They are also not allowed to pass inside information on to someone else which they use for betting.Laura Saunders (Laura Saunders)Additionally, the MPs’ code of conduct bars members from “causing significant damage to the reputation and integrity of the house”.An MP placing a bet with inside knowledge is likely to cross this threshold.Who else is being investigated?Craig Williams, the PM’s parliamentary private secretary, was the first person caught up in the scandal.He admitted placing a bet on the election prior to Mr Sunak’s announcement after he was approached by a journalist.The 39-year-old Tory candidate for Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr placed a £100 bet with 5-1 odds at Ladbrokes, meaning he would have won £500, but his name was raised as potentially a “politically exposed person”, so the wager was not registered.The bookmaker is believed to be particularly cautious over “novelty” betting markets such as the general election.According to The Guardian, which first reported the story, the bet was placed via an online account that would have required Mr Williams to provide personal details, including his date of birth and debit card. The bookmaker also knows the location of the bet.Ladbrokes declined to comment on the incident but the Gambling Commission issued a statement confirming that it was investigating.Mr Williams apologised after admiting that he had placed a wager on the bet, but refused to comment further while the GC carried out its probe.“I clearly made a huge error of judgment, that’s for sure, and I apologise,” he told. “I will not be expanding on my statement because it’s an independent process.”Laura Saunders became the second person to be named in the affair.Ms Saunders, the Tory candidate for Bristol North West, is also under investigation by the Gambling Commission (GC) over claims she may have had inside knowledge about the prime minister’s decision to call a snap poll for 4 July.Ms Saunders has worked for the party since 2015 and was married to Tony Lee, who works as the Conservative Party’s director of campaigns. Mr Lee has since taken a leave of absence after it came to light he was the third person being probed by the GC.According to the BBC, which first named Ms Saunders as the candidate under investigation, she worked most recently at the party’s international division at Conservative Campaign Headquarters, which works with other centre-right parties around the world.Close protection officer arrestedA police officer in Mr Sunak’s close protection team was arrested and suspended over alleged bets about the timing of the general election.The police constable from the Met’s Royalty and Specialist Protection Command was arrested on 17 June on suspicion of misconduct in public office after the betting watchdog contacted the force last Friday.The officer was taken into custody and bailed pending further enquiries, with the case being referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, according to the Met.What have senior Tories said about the scandal?Mr Sunak said it was “very disappointing” news that Mr Williams was being investigated by the GC.“Well, it’s very disappointing news and you would have seen Craig Williams say that it was a huge error of judgement,” he told broadcasters at the G7 summit earlier in June.After further revelations, Mr Sunak said he would sack anyone found guilty of wrongdoing.“These investigations are ongoing … one of them is a criminal investigation that’s being conducted by the police,” he told the BBC Question Time Leaders Special general election debate. “What I can tell you is if anyone is found to have broken the rules, not only should they face the full consequences of the law, I will make sure that they are booted out of the Conservative Party.”Michael Gove, the outgoing cabinet minister, said it would be “reprehensible” to use inside information to bet on the general election date.“If people have used inside information to place bets, that is deeply wrong,” he told the BBC on Thursday morning after Ms Saunders’s case came to light.“What I can’t do is sort of get too much into the detail of the case while an investigation is going on.“But I can talk about the broad principle and you’re absolutely right, it’s reprehensible.”After Mr Mason was named the fourth Tory under investigation, Mr Gove likened the controversy to the Partygate scandal, saying it looked like there is “one rule for them and one rule for us”.",Everything we know about Tory election betting scandal,13,9
333,"The man who could become the face of the greatest shock in British political history has claimed that whether he wins or not, there is a “bubbling undercurrent” of change in the electorate which means once safe Tory strongholds will fall.Tom Wilson is the 29-year-old Labour candidate running against Rishi Sunak in Richmond and Northallerton who, according to polls last week, could be the first electoral “king killer” – in that he may be the first person to defeat a sitting prime minister in a general election.He became a person of interest for the entire political establishment when an MRP poll last week suggested Mr Sunak’s constituency was “too close to call”.For everyone looking for the so-called “Portillo moment” of this election – named after the shock defeat of Michael Portillo in the 1997 Tory collapse – this looked unbeatable.Tom Wilson met the prime minister briefly on Sunday, shaking hands while both out campaigning in the constituency (Tom Wilson)In his first major interview with a national newspaper, Mr Wilson told The Independent that the feedback he is getting on the doorstep in the Yorkshire constituency he grew up in suggests that the ultimate electoral shock may be possible.But the fact that the Tories are reportedly sending extra bodies to help the prime minister hold on to a seat he won with a majority north of 27,000 in 2019 is a victory in itself.“It feels like years ago [when] I first made my application,” Mr Wilson told The Independent. “It was very much about making them work for it. And actually, we’ve already achieved that. So yeah, in that sense we’ve already won.”He laughed about the prospect of activists being bussed up from CCHQ in London to save the prime minister.“There’s rumours, isn’t there? I’m yet to see a bunch of suited types lost in the dales.Tom Wilson is Labour’s candidate for Richmond and Northallerton (Tom Wilson)“They’re clearly restricting things to higher ground [with] the story about supposedly bringing resources out of seats with majorities of up to 7,000.“We have to treat that almost as a bit of a ruse. There’s no reason they necessarily are going to tell everyone that they’re doing this. We can’t be complacent.”Mr Wilson met the prime minister briefly on Sunday, shaking hands while both out campaigning in the constituency. There was another awkward moment at a show where he was running an allotment stall while Mr Sunak was doing a tour.“I guess the first time I meet him properly will be at the count,” he said.Richmond and Northallerton is a vast, sprawling rural seat, the second biggest in land area in England. But what is going on there is reflected elsewhere in that suddenly Labour – always seen as an industrial or metropolitan party – is speaking to the rural vote as well.Wilson with Labour activists at Catterick garrison (Tom Wilson)In Norfolk South West, Mr Sunak’s predecessor Liz Truss is fighting for her political life and just last week the prime minister took his battle bus to Sir Geoffrey Cox’s seat in west Devon which had a majority of more than 25,000. One of the MRP polls, in fact, had blue East Anglia painted almost entirely red last week.Sir Keir Starmer has become the first Labour leader to don his wellies and tramp into Tory farmland territory proclaiming “rural communities are in my DNA”.It is a change that Mr Wilson senses as well. He has found that there are deep concerns about services in traditional Tory heartlands like his constituency, not least the closure of a hospital which will force people to travel to Newcastle or Leeds for treatment. It perhaps sums up most of all why Labour is picking up votes in rural communities.“There is a bubbling undercurrent of quite poor people in vulnerable situations in this constituency – being rural magnifies every problem,” he said.“Because not only have you got to worry about whether the ambulance can get to you on time, it’s also that you’re so much further away from the hospital when you take a stumble or when an elderly relative lives in a tiny little village in the dales – there’s a real concern there that they’re not going to get the treatment they need.A local farmer puts Labour posters up on his barn to support Wilson against Sunak (Tom Wilson)“And because it’s rural, you can't always guarantee that you can live near your family. And so there’s, yeah, there’s this huge discontent.”Mr Wilson said the surge in support for candidates like him is often based on “hope”.“People seeming to lose hope seems to be a running theme in this election, and being able to present your ideas for a kind of credible plan to help them directly, and just giving people that time, you can start to see people maybe rediscover a bit of that hope,” he said.After 4 July, Mr Wilson very much hopes that he will be the new MP for Richmond and Northallerton but admits he sometimes wonders if he is “daydreaming”.“It’s quite incredible, isn’t it? But if you get too lost daydreaming about it, then it’ll never happen.“The fact that it seems to be in the range of possibilities is motivating. Like I say, a lot of people have thoroughly been consigned to the Tories always winning, and now think that this is an opportunity for change, not just here in the prime minister’s seat, but across the country.“No voter fits easily the kind of boxes or demographics that the national analysis of elections tends to put people into. Everyone’s their own individual, they all have their own priorities and their own issues.”The prime minister’s campaign missteps have also had an impact on his local seat, not least the anger over him returning early from the D-Day commemorations with Catterick garrison based in the seat.But for Mr Wilson, who works for the NHS, it was the way David Cameron and George Osborne’s austerity in the coalition government thwarted his dreams of becoming a musician that got him into politics.“When I was a teenager I wanted to become a musician, first and foremost, and I was learning how to play the drums and bass guitar at a music centre in Darlington. But in the Cameron era the local council suddenly had a black hole of however many tens of thousands of pounds.”He became involved in a campaign to save the centre and when that was not possible “it became a fundraising campaign with the local councillors across the board. Then it was very shortly after that that first I joined the Labour Party.”He has, though, very much got the election bug whatever the result.Mr Wilson added: “I’ve really enjoyed it, naturally, the experience of being a candidate and talking to people, where they may open up to a candidate in a way that they don’t open up to your average campaigner or your canvasser. It gives you such a window into people’s lives.”",Meet Rishi Sunak’s Labour Party opponent who hopes to bring the PM down,13,9
350,"This is how the Conservative world ends, not with a bang but a flutter. The Tories in office were gamblers, shaggers, nutters and clowns, but at least they were funny – and their wrist too limp to grasp power entirely. Now the cavaliers are leaving the stage; here come the roundheads. Brace yourselves for a war on joy.The most significant moment in this campaign was when Keir Starmer got angry about people laughing at his hundredth recital of the “daddy was a toolmaker” line. He couldn’t grasp that they were laughing at him, not his father. Though some will assume his fury was concocted to save face, what little we know suggests it was 100 per cent real.The Tories have never understood the man. They call him Corbyn in disguise, a commie dressed as a Blairite – and thus every attack line fails because voters can sense it’s not true. He’s a hawk on war; a tough guy on security. There’s no grand plan to redistribute power and wealth. Keir’s character is conservative: calm and honourable, concerned less with method of government than style, with shades of Ted Heath’s “to govern is to serve”. He likes beer, 1980s music and football. He had a strained relationship with his dad, which fascinates touchy-feely media types but is familiar to those of us whose fathers were “present but not involved”. And he self-defines as working class to emphasise he’s the very opposite of Corbyn, that while the radical Left is motored by ideas, he is all about biography – a “lived experience” that super-rich Rishi could never understand.Starmer is exciting, says Labour, because he is boring. So boring he could be an android. In a recent interview, he said he didn’t have a favourite novel or poem, and wasn’t afraid of anything as a child. Asked by a journalist desperate for colour what he dreamt of last night, he replied, “I don’t dream” (not even of electric sheep). He goes to bed at 11, passes out and wakes at 5am.Want to know how he’ll govern? Look at how he’s silenced and expelled the Labour Left. Listen to his highly personal attacks on his opponents: Rishi is a liar, Boris was “a pathetic spectacle of a man”, “without shame” and “ridiculous”, His preferred tone is sanctimonious, which in No 10 will quickly become tedious.The Left is always over-earnest. It can deploy humour as a weapon, but the reason why its efforts at satire are never truly funny is because they are uni-directional, the gags at service to a crusade that is almost unconsciously religious. “Joking aside,” they’d like to say, “the Tories are pure evil.” And one must never discount the possibility that the old crone at the edge of the village really is a witch.See, the great divide in British history isn’t Right v Left but cavalier v roundhead, a historic war between those who think life is a mess but we should try to enjoy it versus those who see it as a deadly serious struggle to build heaven on earth. Starmer looks unoriginal because he’s not here to start a revolution, he’s here to complete one. For decades, perhaps centuries, we’ve been eradicating our traditional order to build something egalitarian, bureaucratic and politically correct –though we’ve hitherto permitted a little bit of extra wealth or freedom or Ruritanian camp as a nod to how things used to be. Those are the relics that Labour’s puritans find most offensive. They are what will be swept away.The Lords has no teeth anymore, but it must go. Foxes cannot be chased, but even drag hunting will end. Private schooling is already exclusive, but Starmer will make it prohibitive (grammars and home-schooling will be next). Gentlemen’s clubs will be encouraged to admit women. Shrunken heads will be returned with a letter of apology. The CofE can bumble on because it’s Labour at prayer anyway, but the last vestiges of Christian ethics will be erased from the law books – abortion decriminalised, suicide to be assisted – as a new moral paradigm is clinically entrenched. You know what’s coming: rainbow flags everywhere, ministers reeling off pronouns, the Equality Act expanded, gender nonsense endorsed.The next government will also go to war on the car, declare a climate emergency, discourage meat, scream at smokers that they’re going to Hell, and chip away at property. No, Starmer won’t raise the big three taxes; that would hurt productivity. But he implied in his definition of “working people” – those who cannot write a cheque – that idle wealth is a decadent luxury.Charles I collected Van Dycks. Cromwell sold them off. And, if the Labour super-majority were so inclined, it would ban maypoles and Christmas puddings.If you want a vision of the future, remember lockdown – an attempt to make the country do the “right thing”, with the noblest of intentions but demoralising and destructive. And absolutely no laughing at the back.Whatever gimmicks are tried by Labour, no matter how comically they go wrong, critics will be accused of frivolity – of insufficient concern for the public’s welfare. The second most significant moment of the election campaign was when Sunak admitted to a diet of Haribo and Twix, and an angry caller demanded to know why he was making light of tooth decay.Britain is going to be run by people like that for five long years.",Brace yourself for Starmer’s war on life’s great pleasures,13,11

226,"Rishi Sunak will warn that it would take decades to recover from the “disaster” of a Labour government as he seeks to rally Tories to fight for every vote in the closing stages of the General Election campaign.The Prime Minister will tell activists they have just 10 days to “take our message to every corner of the United Kingdom” before polls open on July 4.With the Conservatives still around 20 points behind in the polls and after a bruising few days dominated by allegations about alleged insider betting, Mr Sunak will urge Tories not to “surrender” to Sir Keir Starmer’s party.The Prime Minister will launch the Scottish Tory manifesto and address a campaign event in London at the start of the last full week of campaigning.His latest intervention comes with him under pressure from within the Conservative Party to take a tougher stance against those being investigated by the Gambling Commission for betting on the election date.According to extracts of his speech briefed to the Daily Mail, Mr Sunak will say: “We have 10 days to take our message to every corner of the United Kingdom.“To make the argument that this country needs lower taxes, not £2,000 more taxes for every working family.“To make the case that a Labour government would be bad for our country, and an unchecked Labour government would be a disaster from which it would take decades to recover.”(PA Graphics)Labour has repeatedly denied Tory claims that it is planning to increase taxes on working families.But Mr Sunak will say: “When a politician won’t tell you what they are going to do, it means that they know you won’t like it.“All their evasions tell you is that they are going to whack up council tax and a bunch of other taxes.“And one thing we know about Keir Starmer is that he has no problem going back on his promises. His career is a story of commitments dropped as soon as they became too difficult to keep.“I tell you this: once you have handed Keir Starmer and Labour a blank cheque, you won’t be able to get it back.”In an attempt to boost Tory morale, Mr Sunak will say: “Don’t surrender to Labour. Fight for every vote, fight for our values, fight for our vision of Britain.”The Conservative campaign has been plunged into a deeper crisis by the gambling controversy, with the party’s chief data officer Nick Mason understood to be taking a leave of absence amid claims he placed bets on the election date.Director of campaigning Tony Lee has also taken a leave of absence, while Mr Lee’s would-be MP wife Laura Saunders and fellow candidate Craig Williams, who was a parliamentary aide to the Prime Minister, are also under investigation by the Gambling Commission.Home Secretary James Cleverly said he was not aware of any ministers caught up in the betting row (Lucy North/PA)With speculation at Westminster about how wide the inquiry might go, Home Secretary James Cleverly faced questions about whether ministers – potentially even in the Cabinet – had placed bets on the surprise summer election.Asked if ministers had bet on the date, he told the BBC: “Not to my knowledge.”Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove compared the impact of the row with the Partygate scandal.“It looks like one rule for them and one rule for us,” he told the Sunday Times, adding: “That’s the most potentially damaging thing.”Mr Gove went on to suggest it was “just not acceptable” for those in a “privileged position” close to the Prime Minister to use what he described as “inside information to make additional money for yourself”.Former justice secretary Sir Robert Buckland suggested Mr Sunak should have taken a tougher line and suspend those caught up in the row.“I do expect everybody to uphold the highest standards,” he told LBC Radio. ”I’m deeply hurt and rather angry that this has happened in the middle of a campaign that is tough enough without things like this to complicate it further.”Former Tory whip Anne Milton told Times Radio: “Suspension is the right thing to do while people are investigated. It’s harsh … if the allegations are found not to be true, but that is what would happen in any other sphere of work.”Mr Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer will face questions from Sun readers on Monday afternoon in the latest set piece of the election campaign.Labour is set to focus on health issues, raising concerns about “DIY dentistry” because of a lack of NHS treatment.Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: “It’s virtually impossible to get a dentist appointment after 14 years of Conservative neglect.“People are resorting to pulling their own teeth out – DIY dentistry should be the stuff of Charles Dickens’ books, not Britain in 2024.”",Sunak warns Labour government would be ‘disaster’ as he battles to save campaign,14,4
232,"Rishi Sunak’s election campaign was dealt another blow on Sunday after it emerged that a fourth Conservative was being investigated over a bet on the date of the general election.Nick Mason, the party’s data chief, has taken a leave of absence after becoming the latest Tory to be reportedly investigated by the Gambling Commission for allegedly betting on the timing of the election before the date had been announced.The latest allegations were published by The Sunday Times, which claimed dozens of bets had been placed with potential winnings worth thousands of pounds. A spokesman for the official told the paper that he denied wrongdoing.What are the rules for MPs and others on betting with inside knowledge?Using confidential information to gain an unfair advantage when betting may constitute a criminal offence.Gamblers are not allowed to use inside information to place a bet or to instruct someone else to do so on their behalf.They are also not allowed to pass inside information on to someone else which they use for betting.Laura Saunders (Laura Saunders)Additionally, the MPs’ code of conduct bars members from “causing significant damage to the reputation and integrity of the house”.An MP placing a bet with inside knowledge is likely to cross this threshold.Who else is being investigated?Craig Williams, the PM’s parliamentary private secretary, was the first person caught up in the scandal.He admitted placing a bet on the election prior to Mr Sunak’s announcement after he was approached by a journalist.The 39-year-old Tory candidate for Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr placed a £100 bet with 5-1 odds at Ladbrokes, meaning he would have won £500, but his name was raised as potentially a “politically exposed person”, so the wager was not registered.That sparked the Gambling Commission writing to firms demanding the details of all bets made on a July election after 1 May, which it is now combing through. It is now believed to have widened its search beyond MPs and candidates to their friends and relatives as well.Bookmakers are particularly cautious over “novelty” betting markets such as the general election.According to The Guardian, which first reported the story, Mr Williams placed his bet via an online account that would have required him to provide personal details, including his date of birth and debit card. The bookmaker also knows the location of the bet.Ladbrokes declined to comment on the incident but the Gambling Commission issued a statement confirming that it was investigating.Mr Williams apologised after admiting that he had placed a wager on the bet, but refused to comment further while the GC carried out its probe.“I clearly made a huge error of judgment, that’s for sure, and I apologise,” he told. “I will not be expanding on my statement because it’s an independent process.”Laura Saunders became the second person to be named in the affair.Ms Saunders, the Tory candidate for Bristol North West, is also under investigation by the Gambling Commission (GC) over claims she may have had inside knowledge about the prime minister’s decision to call a snap poll for 4 July.Ms Saunders has worked for the party since 2015 and was married to Tony Lee, who works as the Conservative Party’s director of campaigns.

It's safer.""Some people come along and set your tent on fire,"" he tells me.He says no one ever zips up their sleeping bags or tent doors in case they need to escape quickly.This shocking story of the dangers faced by being homeless on the streets of London doesn't seem to shock Trevor. It's just part of life, he says.""There's no point reporting it to the police, they won't do anything.""At 53 years old, Trevor has been homeless for the best part of a decade.In and out of temporary accommodation, night shelters and hostels. He says he's tired.But he's also fed up with what he says is a long line of broken political promises that have failed to tackle Britain's worsening housing crisis.""Every government has always said that they are going to solve this problem. But none of them have,"" he says.Trevor is right. Because the latest figures are stark and reveal a worsening situation.In the run-up to the election, all of the political parties are promising to tackle the issue.A 'source of national shame'The annual rough sleeping snapshot provides the government's estimate for how many people were rough sleeping on a given night in autumn 2023.It shows that 3,898 people were sleeping rough across England, an increase of 27% on the previous year.And the number of people sleeping rough is now 61% higher than it was 10 years ago.The Conservatives defend their record despite not having met their 2019 manifesto promise to build 300,000 new homes a year.While Labour says they want to build 1.5 million new homes in their first five years in power.But crucially, there is no target for the number of affordable or social homes Labour would build.And that is central to easing the housing crisis, according to Matt Downie, chief executive of the homeless charity Crisis.""The scale of rough sleeping is now a source of national shame. It is a sign of extreme inequality and must prompt a rethink at the highest levels of government,"" he says.""It cannot be overstated how dehumanising sleeping on the streets is. Through our frontline services we hear directly from people who have been spat at, urinated on or attacked simply because they do not have the security of a safe home. Things have got to change.""To bring these numbers down, we urgently need Westminster to put long-term funding into the proven solutions. We need to see a commitment to build the levels of social housing we need every year.""For Trevor, who is desperate to find a place to call home, the sums do not add up.In his area of Brent, northwest London, rooms rent for upwards of £1,000 a month.

108,"LABOUR’S plan to charge VAT on private school fees shouldn’t automatically lead to higher costs for parents, a Gwent candidate has said.Catherine Fookes, who is standing for the party in Monmouthshire which is home to one of Wales’ best known independent schools, said the impact of raising VAT on fees charged to parents will be a matter for those schools.She was speaking after the Liberal Democrat candidate for Monmouthshire said he wanted to clarify the party is opposed to “taxing education”.William Powell, a qualified languages teacher who has taught in both the state and independent sector, said: “I oppose any attempt to undermine parental choice – especially when it could impact further on class sizes in state schools.”Mr Powell said he attended his local state school, near Brecon in Powys, as did his own children but said he also feared raising VAT on fees would mean private schools would do less in their local communities.He said he’d been asked to clarify his party’s stance after attending hustings and a recording of BBC Radio 4’s Any Questions political discussion show in Newport.He said: “As we already see in Monmouthshire, independent schools often give back to our local community in accordance with their charitable status.“Liberal Democrats want to see this sort of best practice become the norm across the sector, with sharing sports facilities, theatre spaces or specialist teachers; mentoring schemes for teachers and pupils; higher education support;  debating clubs as well as bursaries and scholarships.“Under Labour’s proposed regressive policy, all this great partnership work would inevitably be the first thing that private schools cut back on – and everyone would therefore be the loser.”Labour’s candidate, who is also a county councillor representing Monmouth, said she has already met with the headteacher of the town’s Haberdashers independent school, and defended Labour’s policy.Ms Fookes, who has also been a governor at Monmouth Comprehensive, said she recognised the independent schools in Monmouth as “part of our community” and added they “contribute to our local economy and are used by many families.”READ MORE: Questions wanted for Abergavenny general election hustingsShe said: “A UK Labour government will levy VAT on private schools, end their business rate exemptions and spend that money improving standards and opportunities for the over 93 per cent of children attending state schools.“I have already met with the headteacher of the Haberdashers school as I know that if I am elected, I would need to represent all the residents in the community, no matter where they go to school. No additional costs are required to be passed on to families by independent schools. That will be a decision for them to make.”Labour has said additional funds from VAT on fees would support the recruitment of 6,500 new teachers in England, and new teachers in Wales though leader Kier Starmer acknowledged, when he visited Abergavenny, it would be a matter for the Welsh Government how it spends additional funding.Ms Fookes said she wants Labour to “drive high standards in all our state schools” and said: “Our Welsh Labour Government has been doing this with one hand tied behind its back.”Mr Powell said the Liberal Democrats want a “fairer funding formula for Wales” which he claimed would deliver more money than Labour’s planned VAT rise. He also said the current VAT exemption applies to all education provided by “an eligible body” including universities, music lessons and tutoring sessions.Figures from member association the Independent Schools Council show there are 7,304 pupils attending 19 independent schools in Wales in 2024, which is the lowest number of any part of the UK other than the north east of England.Full list of candidates standing in the Monmouthshire constituency:Ian Chandler, Green PartyDavid TC Davies, Welsh ConservativeJune Davies, True & Fair PartyCatherine Fookes, Welsh LabourOwen Lewis, IndependentEmma Meredith, Heritage PartyWilliam Powell, Welsh Liberal DemocratsMax Windsor-Peplow, Reform UK",Election candidates clash over plan for VAT on private school fees,14,6
283,"Six voters across the UK volunteered to let the research agency Revealing Reality spend three days recording what they saw on their phone screens as part of a study aimed at understanding what media people are consuming in the run-up to the election. These are their stories.***ZoyaAge: 28 Location: Birmingham Job: Telecoms manager Previous vote: Labour Probable vote: Green Favourite news source: TikTok/InstagramZoya had never heard of the Israel-Palestine dispute before the 7 October attack by Hamas and Israel’s subsequent aerial bombardment and ground invasion. Since then her social media feeds have been swamped with Gaza-related content and it has become one of her top political issues. This has undermined her trust in the BBC and Sky News, which she feels are pro-Israel. She prefers Instagram, TikTok and clips from Al Jazeera as they provide her with pro-Palestine content, some of which is AI-generated.Her phone usage stats show she consumes very little mainstream media. She doesn’t watch much TV and spends most of her evening scrolling on her phone. Zoya doesn’t visit news websites because she thinks their stories are too long and full of jargon. Instead, occasional bits of news filter through on her social media feeds among food and lifestyle material, often made by British-Pakistani content creators.Her screen recording shows she encounters very little election-related content. She spends a lot of time looking at videos of life in Dubai and she is intrigued by a TikTok video posted by an influencer claiming that Rishi Sunak is offering people £75,000 to emigrate from the UK. (The claim is fake.)When she does want political information, she searches TikTok for summaries of party policies. She is mainly concerned about health and crime, but is opposed to proposals to send more money to Ukraine and wants it spent in the UK instead. She said she liked Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader, because he was a “good guy” who understood her community, unlike Keir Starmer, and would probably vote Green due to the party’s policy on Gaza.***StaceyAge: 36 Location: Clacton Job: Full-time mother of five Previous vote: N/A Probable vote: Labour Favourite news source: FacebookStacey is the sort of voter Nigel Farage needs to win if he is to be elected in Clacton. But her respect for the Reform leader went down after seeing claims online suggesting the Reform party leader staged being attacked by a milkshake. (These claims are false.)She spends six hours a day on Facebook, TikTok and Instagram. She sees close to nothing about national news, but will sometimes click on a Sun or MailOnline celebrity story if it is recommended by Facebook.Her news content mainly consists of updates posted on local Facebook groups by members of the public, but she also checks the Facebook page of her local Clacton and Frinton Gazette. If she wants to research something, she will Google it.She lives with five children, some who have disabilities, in a two-bed house with mould. Her biggest concern is the lack of social housing in Clacton, and she is upset that when a local council development was built, homes were given to people “from out of the area”.Her main exposure to election-related media on her phone was a paid-for Facebook advert by the local Labour party candidate. She stumbled across his video in her feed by chance, but spent several minutes watching it and reading the comments. She concluded that she might vote for him as he understood local issues and was promising more housing.***SimonAge: 45 Location: Dundee Job: Technician Previous vote: SNP Probable vote: SNP Favourite news source: FacebookSimon’s phone recording showed him spending an average of five hours a day on Facebook, mainly scrolling his news feed without engaging deeply with any content.A strong supporter of Scottish independence, he lost faith in the BBC over its perceived pro-union bias during the 2014 referendum. Despite this, he still “reluctantly” visits their news website regularly for overviews of what is going on in the world and sometimes watches BBC TV news and listens to Radio 2.He used to be a “fervent” online poster, but no longer publicly shares much content. Instead, like other people in this study, he shares material privately in WhatsApp groups. The arrival of Euro 2024 has also seen politics content overwhelmed by Tartan army memes.Politics content on his feed was often in the form of memes – such as a Simpsons joke mocking Starmer for repeatedly mentioning that his father was a toolmaker. Simon paused scrolling for long enough to comment: “He’s the tool.” He also hovered over a meme of Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross being kicked by a man in a kilt and one of Farage turning into Hitler.Simon has heard Conservative minister Grant Shapps’ warning of a Labour supermajority – which strengthened his desire to vote for the Scottish National party.***AvaAge: 67 Location: Lowestoft Job: Technician Previous vote: Conservative Probable vote: Undecided Favourite news source: BBCAva’s phone activity shows she has retreated from political news on social media. On Facebook, she has unfriended many “acquaintances” due to unpleasant political discussions during past elections. Instead, she has turned back to BBC TV news and the World Service.She avoids engaging in political debates online so as not to offend others with her opinions or risk receiving offensive comments. She has growing disdain for online political content, saying: “If anybody were to admit to me that they made their minds up on who to vote on some Instagram posts, I’d be less than impressed.”She is a lifelong Conservative voter but did not mind Labour until “Mr Corbyn came in”. His policies – such as support for nuclear disarmament – left her feeling “afraid”. She much prefers Starmer, but dislikes the Labour leader’s deputy, Angela Rayner.***FinleyAge: 19 Location: Buckinghamshire Job: Student Previous vote: N/A Probable vote: Liberal Democrat Favourite news source: X/YouTubeFinley is an avid gamer and first-time voter who has never had any relationship with mainstream news outlets. Instead, he relies on TikTok, X and Instagram – but he will turn to YouTube for lengthy explainers on complicated topics.Many of his opinions are formed by watching reaction videos. He won’t read traditional news stories, but will seek out extreme viewpoints in order to comprehend political arguments, saying: “I suppose I’d be more interested in people’s reactions than, you know, the thing itself.”His Instagram feed is full of Gaza content, but his main concern in this election is transgender rights. He was prompted to research party manifestos after stumbling across a decade-old video on TikTok explaining elections by the comedian Jay Foreman. Finley was deeply concerned about the government’s temporary ban on puberty blockers, although he did not know which party introduced it.He has never watched linear TV and does not passively consume broadcast news. Instead, he relaxes by flicking through TikTok videos at speed, usually giving them a fraction of a second of his attention. A few of Labour’s in-house TikTok posts made their way into his feed, but he thought many of them were “a bit annoying” and trying too hard.He knew Farage, but only as a meme, rather than a politician, largely because gamers used the Cameo app to pay the Reform leader to say silly things. He also learned about Sunak leaving the D-day commemorations early only after seeing a reaction video by the YouTuber Niko Omilana.He trusts the BBC News brand, but never actively consumes any of its content. He also could not understand why older people posted political content under their own names on social media.***MatthewAge: 60 Location: Wigan Job: Retired Previous vote: Conservative Probable vote: Labour Favourite news source: BBC NewsA self-described creature of habit, Matthew makes a point of sitting down in front of the TV for the evening news at 10pm. He also regularly checks the BBC News app during the day, although he rarely reads beyond the headlines and the first few paragraphs of any story. If there’s something he’s really interested in, then he’ll share a link in a WhatsApp group for friends or ex-colleagues – and he laughed at memes of Sunak portrayed as a Dickensian child asking for “more Sky TV”.He reads a lot of business news from mainstream news outlets through the Stocks app on his iPhone, even though he’s not entirely sure why he sees it. “If it’s ended up in the Apple app, you broadly think it’s probably going to be correct … If it’s on there, I think it’s trustworthy,” he said.He liked Tony Blair, voted Remain, but strongly disliked Corbyn. He is now considering voting Labour, in part because the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, worked at the Bank of England and he feels the country is ready for change.

364,"We are entering the last full week of campaigning for a general election that many have written off as a foregone conclusion. Certainly the chances of a Conservative victory are remote, as conceded by a number of senior ministers anxious to limit the damage to their own party.But while the polls are unremittingly bleak, they still show a large number of undecideds as well as Tories deserting their natural home who might yet be persuaded back.Many say they intend to vote for Reform UK, which in some polls is running neck and neck with the Conservatives. Their two votes combined would be enough to run Labour close in the election yet Sir Keir Starmer seems to be on course for the biggest parliamentary majority in post-war history.If Rishi Sunak’s intention in calling a snap election was to catch Reform off guard and squeeze its vote then it has backfired. The pollster Peter Kellner believes there are three million Conservatives who are moving over to Reform and need to be won back by July 4. There are around 130 seats which polling projections say Labour will win where the combined Tory-Reform vote would be sufficient to keep them in Conservative hands.Even holding on to half of these constituencies would be the difference between a virtual wipeout for the Tories and a respectable result providing a platform on which to provide strong opposition and build for the future.Nigel Farage’s comments about Nato’s role in Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine may persuade many Tories thinking of voting Reform to stay loyal. So, too, might the prospect of Labour winning an unprecedented majority because of the split on the Right.

79,"Is this the first post-mainstream-media election? The Guardian asked six volunteers to record their phone screens for three days – and the results provide a glimpse of what news, if any, the British public is consuming as they go to the polls.Zoya, 28, a British-Pakistani woman in Birmingham, used to be a loyal Labour voter who knew nothing about Palestine. After watching TikTok videos and AI-generated Instagram posts, she is now a Green supporter who feels Gaza is her top issue.Stacey, 36, who lives in the Clacton constituency where Nigel Farage is standing for election, rarely engages with mainstream news outlets, but may vote Labour for the first time after the party paid to push adverts into her Facebook feed.Finley, 19, a student in Buckinghamshire, has almost zero connection with mainstream news and forms his political opinions by reading the angry comments left below Instagram videos.Working with the research agency Revealing Reality, the Guardian was allowed to monitor the phone activity of these and three other volunteers and interviewed them about their media consumption.Although the sample is just a snapshot, several trends were clear: voters are seeing less political content on their social media feeds, traditional news outlets are less prominent in their lives, and influencers have an ever greater role in shaping political opinions.Most notably, compared with elections that took place in the 2010s, people are less willing to share their political views on social media. Conversations about politics are instead taking place in private chat groups on Snapchat, Instagram and WhatsApp.Damon De Ionno, of Revealing Reality, who ran the research programme, said this reflected rapid changes in online behaviour since the last general election. “Social media went through a period where it was fun to put stuff out there and it was a lighthearted playground. People are now just much more wary about putting views out there, or stories about themselves.”There is a generational divide. Older voters are still seeking out mainstream broadcasters such as the BBC and ITV and viewing it as a civic duty to be aware of the broad national news agenda.From the research group, Peter, 60, in Wigan, has stuck to his habit of watching a news bulletin every evening. Ava, 67, in Lowestoft, chose to block Facebook friends who posted about politics in the wake of the 2019 election.Peter, 45, an SNP supporter in Dundee, spends five hours a day scrolling through Facebook and views the BBC with suspicion, but still relies on the broadcaster for an overview of what is going on while picking up headlines from Radio 2.The younger participants tended to have some trust in the BBC, but they didn’t feel the same deep connection to it – and didn’t feel the need to be across the broader Westminster-centric news agenda. Instead, they cared deeply about certain key issues that they deemed directly relevant to their lives, such as the war in Gaza, gender issues and housing.As a result, the sources they relied on tended to be influencers or friends rather than mainstream news outlets. Finley, a first-time voter, knew little about Keir Starmer, but said his friendship group was talking about how the Labour leader “went back on a policy about giving trans people better rights”.Watching the phone activity of the younger participants revealed how they often encounter news stories through other people’s reaction posts – such as learning about Rishi Sunak’s D-day absence by reverse-engineering memes and jokes that float across their social media feeds. They may see election-related videos on TikTok, but when interviewed later they would barely remember viewing them.Maeve Garner, one of the researchers, said political content on social media feeds had changed a lot since the 2019 election. “Back then it was still mainstream news sources or headlines being shared. Now you see memes and videos. Memes mean there’s less conversation and debate compared to a news headline.”While there has been an enormous amount of media attention on whether the Sun will endorse a particular candidate in the election, none of the participants read a print newspaper. They relied on news aggregation services such as Apple News or Google’s Discover, which gave them a variety of headlines from a number of mainstream news websites. They were rarely aware of which particular outlet they were reading, although many turned to the BBC News website for a brief overview of what was going on.De Ionno said this could reflect the nature of the contest between Sunak and Starmer. “The personalties are very weak on both sides. It doesn’t have that human story. Boris [Johnson] was worth talking about; same with [Jeremy] Corbyn. People are is quite disengaged from the national picture.”He said a general shift in online media was under way, including in politics. “More content is being produced by influencers and people who want to be influencers. Social media has become less social – there’s a lot less sharing and nearly all the content is professionally produced.”",‘There’s a lot less sharing’: how news consumption has changed since last UK election,14,8
271,"Sir Keir Starmer has said that if he witnessed a mother attempting to shoplift baby formula, he would offer to pay for it.The question was put to the Labour leader by the Big Issue, which also asked prime minister Rishi Sunak, the Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey and Scottish first minister John Swinney what they'd do in the scenario.It follows reports of a surge in shoplifting and other criminal offences following the cost of living crisis, which has seen soaring inflation and sharp price rises for everyday essentials.The price of baby formula has reached ""historically high"" levels, with some supermarkets placing security tags on the products, and the Competition and Markets Authority watchdog launching a market study to help consumers.Asked what he would do if he saw someone trying to steal baby formula, Starmer told the Big Issue: ""I’d offer to pay it. The desperation of families around the country should make the Tories feel nothing but shame.”Read more:Asda shop bans ‘granny trolleys’ in crackdown on theft (The Telegraph)Co-op store put on lockdown after would-be shoplifters turn 'violent' (Southern Daily Echo)The scandal of London's disappearing police stations (The Evening Standard)Tory leader Sunak said: “Shoplifting is not a victimless crime, and we’ll always support shopkeepers to prevent theft. At the same time, we will continue to help parents with the cost of living.”Liberal Democrat leader Davey said: “I’d try and try to persuade [the parent] not to, obviously... Try and find them other help, that would be the best way of doing it.”Meanwhile SNP leader and first minister of Scotland John Swinney said: “I’d discreetly offer to pay for the formula as no parent should ever have to face this situation... Sadly this is not hypothetical – I meet with my constituents, and people across Scotland, every week who face this kind of hardship.”How much has shoplifting risen in the UK?According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), shoplifting offences recorded by police in England and Wales have risen to the highest level in 20 years.Some 402,482 offences were recorded in the year to September 2023, up nearly a third (32%) on 304,459 in the previous 12 months.A survey by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) puts the figure even higher, reporting a record high of 16.7 million shoplifting incidents in 2023.The trade-association's claim that only 36% of retail crimes are reported to police, and additional data from Scotland, could explain the discrepancy with the ONS figures.Respondents to the survey suggested that pressures caused by the cost of living crisis could be encouraging people to steal multiple items at a time instead of one or two.'We’ll always support shopkeepers to prevent theft,' Rishi Sunak said. (Alamy)How much is the cost of living crisis to blame?A recent report by the London School of Economics (LSE) shows a clear link between a 10% rise in the cost of living and increases in violence, robberies, shoplifting, burglary and theft over the past year.The study points to previous academic literature which suggests a link between economic hardship and crime, although it acknowledges the relationship is complex and multifaceted"".It found that with a 10% rise in living costs, there was an 8% increase in crimes including burglary and theft and some violent offences.However, the study pointed out that while there appeared to be a correlation between the cost of living and these crimes, this is not the same thing as causation.It found that some crimes, including antisocial behaviour offences, had fallen, and that there had been an overall a 2.4% decrease in calls to the police.Referencing the study in March 2024 as he called on the government to tackle the root causes of crime head-on, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: “The causes of crime are complex. But the overall formula is pretty simple: Too much inequality and too little opportunity produces criminality.""That’s not – and nor should it ever be – a justification for criminal behaviour. If you break the law of course you should pay the consequences. Nor does it imply that all those in poverty turn to criminal behaviour.Tory cuts have consequences. New research shows a clear link between the cost-of-living crisis and crime. We urgently need a national strategy to tackle the complex causes of crime, invest in our broken criminal justice system and support victims.pic.twitter.com/oiukLXem0H— Sadiq Khan (@SadiqKhan) March 15, 2024""But if we want to be sincere about making our city safer, we need to be serious about crime prevention. That begins with acknowledging that no one just wakes up in the morning and – out of nowhere – harms another person with a knife or steals a car… joins a criminal gang or breaks into someone’s home. The clock begins ticking long before the crime is committed.""In January 2024, policing minister Chris Philp said inflation was “no excuse at all” for people to resort to crime, telling Sky News: “We have a very generous benefits system. We are spending well over £100 billion a year on working age benefits. They went up by 10% in April this year.""They are going up by another six or seven per cent in April. The national minimum wage is going to go up by 10%. There is no excuse at all for any criminal activity including shoplifting.”However, according to the Big Issue, his claims don't stand up to examination. Pointing to research by the Trussell Trust and Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF), Universal Credit claimants were on average £35 a week short of the money they needed for essentials like food and heating.The findings, based on conservative estimates, found that a single person needs around £120 per week to cover essentials before housing costs, but would only receive £85 each week on universal credit.Benefits were set to increase by 6.7% under measures announced in April, although 180,000 claimants working less than half of a full-time week will be required to look for more work in an attempt to get people off welfare.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

I feel very optimistic about the fact that we can reconcile those two things and move forward together as a country.“If we have a political culture that’s about bringing people together – and navigating our way through these conversations with respect, genuinely listening to different perspectives, rather than seeing these differences as divisions to be exploited.” (Sky News)Minister accuses broadcaster of suggesting ‘someone is guilty until proven innocent’ when asked about betting scandal08:42 , Jabed AhmedChris Heaton-Harris has accused a broadcaster of “trying to suggest someone is guilty until proven innocent” when asked why Rishi Sunak would not take robust action over the betting allegations.Asked whether the Prime Minister should ask Craig Williams when he placed his bet, the Northern Ireland Secretary told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It wouldn’t surprise me in the slightest if that conversation has been had but you asked me if I knew, and I don’t.”Mr Heaton-Harris added he would not provide any extra comment on an ongoing investigation when asked if Mr Sunak is confident the bet was properly placed.Asked why the Prime Minister cannot take what former minister Tobias Ellwood has called “robust action”, he told presenter Mishal Husain: “I think what you’re trying to suggest is that someone is guilty until they’re proven innocent and that is not how this works.”Voters will be looking at tax plans not betting scandal, minister claims08:25 , Salma OuaguiraA Tory minister has said voters at the general election will be looking at who is planning to cut taxes and immigration, not the betting scandal engulfing the party, Archie Mitchell reports.Northern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris was asked by BBC Radio 4’s Today programme whether the scandal would cost the Conservatives seats at the election.Mr Heaton-Harris said: “I actually don’t know… people decide how they vote on a whole host of things. I would imagine most people will be looking at whether they want a Conservative government that will reduce their taxes or a Labour government that will increase them.“Whether they want a Labour government that will no doubt bring higher immigration figures and what they’ll cut immigration.”Labour: ‘People are literally pulling their own teeth out’08:24 , Salma OuaguiraWes Streeting has said that “people are literally pulling their own teeth out” becuase of the state of NHS dentists.The shadow health secretary added that Labour would “get the British Dental Association in to start the process of long overdue contract reform”.“Because I think what will shock people, especially those who’ve either paid through the nose for private dentistry, or have been priced out altogether, is that last year there was a £400 million underspend in the NHS dentistry budget,” he said.Tory minister admits betting scandal is ‘not great’ and distracting from campaign08:10 , Salma OuaguiraA Conservative minister has admitted the election betting scandal engulfing the party is “not great” and is distracting from the campaign, Archie Mitchell reports.Asked how damaging the Gambling Commission’s investigation has been, Northern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris told LBC: “It’s not great. We should be talking about how we are going to lower taxes and immigration.”But the minister defended Rishi Sunak’s decision not to suspend the two Tory candidates involved in the scandal, saying it is up to the Gambling Commission’s investigation.He claimed candidates are “innocent until proven gulilty” and added the Gambling Commission investigation should be respected.Pressed about Craig Williams, who admitted he put a bet on the July 4 date, he said the party has to wait until he is found guilty by the watchdog as “we don’t know whether he did that with prior knowledge.” (LBC)Everything we know about Tory election betting scandal08:00 , Salma OuaguiraEverything we know about Tory election betting scandalCabinet minister accuses Labour of trying to pressure the Gambling Commission07:50 , Salma OuaguiraChris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland Secretary has accused Labour of trying to “pressure” the Gambling Commission as they investigate into the Tory general election betting scandal.The minister said Pat McFadden’s letter to the watchdog at the weekend urging to release the name of the candidates was “pretty concerning”.He told Times Radio: “It has said it is investigating offences in relation to the date of the election, that it is an ongoing investigation and that it won’t provide any details at this time and it is not confirming or denying the identity of any individuals concerned. And it is right that it has an investigation. It is an independent body.“I actually think, I saw that the leader of Labour’s campaign, Pat McFadden, wrote to try and put some undue influence on the Gambling Commission over the weekend and I think that is actually pretty concerning in itself, Labour trying to lean on yet another independent body like it leant on the Speaker of the House of Commons to not have a vote on Gaza.“I think you are beginning to see, people are beginning to see, what a Labour government would actually be like in the United Kingdom.”Tories: ‘No doubt betting scandal will cost party seats'07:45 , Salma OuaguiraConservative candidate Tobias Ellwood has said the ongoing Gambling Commission inquiries into bets on the general election date are “deeply unhelpful, self-inflicted distraction”.Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Tobias Ellwood said “in what world they thought this was acceptable is beyond belief”.He said the row will “in no doubt” cost the already struggling party in the polls several seats on July 4.Cabinet minister criticises Labour’s VAT on private schools07:42 , Salma OuaguiraNorthern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris has said Labour’s plan to impose VAT on private school fees is “unwise”.The Cabinet minister has said the plans could cause a pupil exodus ti state schools and put more pressure on the sector.Asked if he believed the policy was “unfair”, the Northern Ireland Secretary told Sky News: “I think that is unwise certainly. I think people who have saved hard, worked hard, want to spend extra money on their children;’s education should be allowed to.“I actually think it is a very bad policy because it also means lots of children would be entering… a state education system which is doing really well but is not ready to cater for thousands of extra pupils coming in at this time.”Northern Ireland Secretary: ‘I am not a betting man'07:30 , Salma OuaguiraNorthern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris has denied being a “betting man” while being pressed on the Tory gambling scandal.Speaking on Sky News Breakfast, he said: “I don’t mind people betting on things they don’t have knwoledge about.”Mr Heaton-Harris, who is not running on the general election, added that people found guilty of betting on the general election date will be suspended but not while the investigation is ongoing.

Nobody ‘poked the bear with a stick’.“The people of Ukraine voted overwhelmingly in 1991 to be a sovereign and independent country.“They were perfectly entitled to seek both Nato and EU membership. There is only one person responsible for Russian aggression against Ukraine – both in 2014 and 2022 – and that is Putin.“To try to spread the blame is morally repugnant and parroting Putin’s lies.”Former prime minister Boris Johnson criticised Nigel Farage (Andrew Boyers/PA) (PA Wire)Senior Tories turn on Rishi Sunak over failure to get a grip on election betting scandalSunday 23 June 2024 23:00 , Tom WatlingSenior Tories turn on Rishi Sunak over failure to get a grip on betting scandalThe great election turn-off: the true scale of millennials and Gen Z who won’t voteSunday 23 June 2024 22:00 , Matt MathersHuge numbers of younger people feel disenfranchised by the political parties and are not going to vote, exclusive polling for The Independent shows.According to research carried out by Techne UK, around four in 10 people – 41 per cent – aged 18 to 34 have either not registered to vote (24 per cent) or are registered but have decided not to go to the ballot box (17 per cent) next month.Full report:The great election turn-off: the true scale of millennials and Gen Z who won’t voteICYMI: Farage accused of ‘playing into Putin’s hands’ as he doubles down on Ukraine invasion commentsSunday 23 June 2024 21:00 , Matt MathersRishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer have led criticism of Nigel Farage after the Reform UK leader claimed that the West “provoked” Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.It did not stop Mr Farage from doubling down on his comments, originally made in a BBC Panorama interview which aired on Friday night, in a column piece on Saturday afternoon for the Daily Telegraph, claiming that he should “not be blamed for telling the truth about Putin’s war”.Full report:Farage accused of ‘playing into Putin’s hands’ as he doubles down on Ukraine commentsListen: Tory aide describes Rwanda policy as ‘cr**’ in leaked recordingSunday 23 June 2024 20:00 , Matt MathersListen: Tory aide describes Rwanda policy as ‘cr**’ in leaked recordingPhillipson: Electorate are ‘genuinely disgusted’ by betting scandalSunday 23 June 2024 19:20 , Tom WatlingShadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson has said there is “genuine disgust” among voters over the General Election betting allegations.Asked if she had ever put a bet on a political event, Ms Phillipson told the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: “No, I don’t think, it’s only a few occasions in my life where I’ve ever gambled full stop, it’s not really my thing.“I don’t think that’s really the point.

I love it. There’s no better job.“It is a lot easier and a lot less pressured than being prime minister.“The fact of the matter is, I stood and I lost. And what terrifies me now is not not becoming leader, it is seeing Labour come in.”She continued: “This is one of the things that I’ve found most difficult doing this job, that people tend not to know what it is, because I’m always asked the leadership question. We’re so interested in the personalities, in the gossip and so on...“We need to focus on this election. The choice is going to be between us or between them. Be afraid if it is them, is all I would say. And we will talk about leadership things after an election, but not before.”Political leaders wish Princess Royal a speedy recovery13:39 , Joe MiddletonPolitical leaders have wished Princess Anne a speedy recovery after she suffered minor injuries to her head and a concussion when it is believed she was kicked by a horse on her Gatcombe Park estate.The Princess Royal, 73, an Olympic-medal-winning horsewoman, was walking on her Gloucestershire estate on Sunday evening when the incident happened.Emergency services were despatched to the estate and, after medical care at the scene, the princess was transferred to Southmead Hospital in Bristol for appropriate tests, treatment and observation.Prime minister Rishi Sunak said: “Everyone in the country is immensely fond of Her Royal Highness. We’re all sending her our best wishes for a swift recovery.”Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: “Wishing Her Royal Highness a speedy recovery and sending my best wishes on behalf of all of us at the Labour Party.”Labour dodges question about European Court of Justice role in new EU deal13:26 , Andre LangloisShadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds has dodged a question about whether a future Labour government would accept a role for the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in a future deal with the European Union.Taking questions during Bloomberg’s Business Debate, Mr Reynolds said: “We’re not going to give away our negotiating hand entirely but... the argument on food and agricultural products is this: do you want lower standards than the European Union?“If you don’t want lower standards, surely we remove pragmatically some of those checks and balances to make sure we can have as close a relationship as is possible, to remove some of those costs. There will still be costs because we’re not going to talk about going back into a customs union.”Tory business secretary Kemi Badenoch described his response as “astonishing” and added: “What would they have to give up in order to get that? That is the question that they don’t want to answer, saying it’s part of their negotiating hand.”She accused Labour of trying to take the country “back into the EU without saying so” and said: “We cannot allow any kind of oversight from the ECJ – that’s not something that you should be keeping in your back pocket. That’s something that you need to be honest about with the British public.”Mr Reynolds hit back: “This is a conversation on one side, on the Conservative side, which is all about to be frank the next leadership election in the Conservative Party and the red lines within there.”Watch: Tory minister reveals how he would bet on election 'if he was allowed'13:17 , Joe MiddletonKemi Badenoch and Jonathan Reynolds clash over climate and net zero commitments13:12 , Jabed AhmedBusiness secretary Kemi Badenoch and her Labour counterpart Jonathan Reynolds have clashed over whether net zero is an opportunity to be seized or cost to be mitigated.Speaking at Bloomberg’s UK Election 2024: The Business Debate, Mr Reynolds said: “It’s an opportunity. I mean, it couldn’t be any clearer than that – it’s one of the greatest opportunities that has ever existed and actually for the UK, when you think about some of that regional inequality that we are very familiar with, that the transition could be something that isn’t just an opportunity in itself, (but it) actually addresses some of the real long, deep-seated problems within the British economy.“And the job of Government around that is not to deliver that itself, of course it’s not, it’s to build and shape the markets that the private sector will then operate around.”Ms Badenoch responded: “It is both. When we decided that net zero was going to be a policy, this was a cross-party thing. It wasn’t just Conservatives. There is no major party that has said it does not want the net zero target by 2050, but that was in 2018. Look at what happened since then – Covid and a war in Ukraine that’s completely changed the landscape for what that meant.”The Business Secretary added: “Yes, it can be an opportunity, but we need to make sure that we deliver other things on a no-regrets basis.”Mr Reynolds responded and added Labour had altered its £28 billion climate pledge.Rachel Reeves weighs in on Tory election betting scandal13:03 , Jabed AhmedRishi Sunak has shown an “astonishing lack of leadership” by failing to suspend Conservatives facing investigation into betting on the date of the General Election, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has insisted.Ms Reeves said Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer had “been really clear” that “if this had been Labour candidates, their feet would not have touched the ground”.Speaking during a visit to a windfarm in East Renfrewshire, the shadow chancellor said: “When wrong doing takes place in Labour, candidates are suspended. That is not an easy thing to do but it is the right thing to do.”She stated: “It is an astonishing lack of leadership from Rishi Sunak that these candidates are still in place, they have still got the Conservative rosette.“Rishi Sunak is now so weak he is not even able to suspend people who are accused of profiteering from inside information. It is frankly one rule for Conservative candidates and staffers and another rule for everybody else.”She added: “In the end voters will judge the Conservatives on their 14 years and sleaze, the abuse of public office, is quite high in people’s minds. It is one of the reasons why people want change after 14 years of chaos and decline” (Reuters)Reform leader claims Labour in power would be ‘even more incompetent than Tories’12:58 , Salma OuaguiraNigel Farage has claimed that if Labour gets into Downing Street, it would be “even more incompetent than the Conservatives”.The Reform leader said: “I believe this Labour government will get into trouble very, very quickly. They will prove to be, if it is possible, even more incompetent than the Conservatives have been.“And as he tries to take us back to EU rules, as we get more lunacy on trans laws and everything else, you will find a government and a Parliament split from its people.“So my ambition is for us to establish a bridgehead in Parliament on July 4 and over the course of the next five years to build up a mass movement for common sense, for decency, to represent the silent majority in this country.”Farage doubles down on small boats ‘invasion’ attack12:53 , Salma OuaguiraNigel Farage has claimed he was right to describe migrants crossing the Channel in small boats an “invasion”.He doubled down on Reform’s pledge to ditch the European Court on Human Rights as he criticised Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda scheme.He said the UK was “not meanspirited or nasty” but people coming to the UK illegally would never be granted refugee status unless they pay taxes and obey the law.

They can’t convince anyone to back Slippery Starmer and they know there is no love for the Labour Party on the doors, so they’ve resorted to campaigning for Reform in the hope they can stop Conservatives being elected.“Many people across our country are very worried about a Labour Government, and now the cat is out of the bag. A vote for Reform is a vote for Labour and Slippery Starmer.”Farage blasts Tories ‘greedy and stupid’ over betting scandal12:46 , Salma OuaguiraNigel Farage has attacked the Conservatives over the betting scandal engulfing the party.The Reform leader told supporters in Maidstone: “The sheer level of greed and stupidity that leads people right at the heart of government, who know when the election is going to be called, to put on bets is astonishing but perhaps sums up the self-entitled view that this Conservative Party has after 14 years in government.”Mr Farage claimed the current accusations against Tories are just the “tip of the iceberg” and predicted “this scandal will get worse”.Farage: ‘I take no lectures from Labour’12:38 , Salma OuaguiraNigel Farage has responded to attacks made by the main parties on his controversial comments on Ukraine.Speaking from the top of a double-decker bus, he has doubled down on statements about the war and western involvement.He said: “I won’t be lectured by the Conservative party or Sir Keir Starmer. This is the same Starmer who backed Corbyn to leave NATO. So, no thank you.”The Reform leader took aim at Starmer’s pledge to scrap a law protecting Nortern Ireland veterans from prosecution, the Legacy Act. And blasted: “Along with David Lammy, he wants us to join the European Defence Union.” (REUTERS)Sunak responds after IFS slams Tory and Labour manifestos12:38 , Jabed AhmedRishi Sunak has responded to the Institute for Fiscal Studies’ (IFS) analysis of the major parties’ manifestos.Earlier today IFS director Paul Johnson said both the Conservative and Labour manifestos “essentially ignore” some of the “big challenges” in the economy.Facing questions about the analysis, the prime minister said: “No, I don’t agree with that. We have a fully costed manifesto which can deliver tax cuts for people at every stage in their lives and that is largely funded by making sure that we can find some savings in the growth of the welfare budget, because it’s been growing at unsustainable levels since the pandemic.“We’ve set out a very clear plan to reform that, to support people into work, and in fact, the IFS acknowledge that last time around they said that that wasn’t possible, that it was actually delivered, and that’s something that the IFS themselves have said.“Labour in contrast don’t think you can save a single penny from the welfare bill, which is already where we’re spending more than on transport, schools, law enforcement. I don’t think that’s right. I want to deliver tax cuts for people and constraining the increase in the welfare budget is the right way to do that to support people in work.”Farage brands Boris ‘liar’ over Putin12:26 , Salma OuaguiraNigel Farage has branded Boris Johnson a “liar” in a fierce attack for the prime ministe’s criticism over his comments on Ukraine.He unveiled a giant version of an i newspaper frontpage from 2016 with the the headline “Boris blames EU for war in Ukraine”.The Reform leader also said he will not apologise for claiming that the invasion by Russia was “provoked” by the West.He said: “I can’t take those words away. The fact that I was more far-sighted than more politicians is not something I’ll apologise for.”Despite the comments, he condemned Putin’s actions, adding: “None of this justifies what he’s done. And who knows - he may have done it anyway. But we gave him to give his people a reason for doing so.“And you think I’m on my own in thinking this? The Pope in 2022 - it’s not often the Pope and I are on the same side of any debate particularly - I’m a bit more Henry VIII. But the Pope made this point in 2022.” (REUTERS)Nigel Farage is speaking from Maidstone12:22 , Salma OuaguiraThe Reform leader claims his party represents “the new kids on the block” and is the topic of conversation during this election capaign.Speaking in Maidstone, he jokes about his grandchild’s birthday: “I want to make a little announcement. Yesterday was 23 June the anniversary of Brexit. It was also yesterday that my first grandchild was born. I don’t think I’ll ever forget when his brithday is.”He adds: “We are doing rather well. There is more conversation about Reform than anything going on in this campaign that’s partly because Sunak and Starmer are simply so monotone, dull, and don’t say anything believable.”Nigel Farage speaking at the Mercure Maidstone Great Danes Hotel in Maidstone Kent (Jordan Pettitt/PA Wire)Conservatives running parallel inquiry to the Gambling Commission, Sunak says12:10 , Jabed AhmedPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has said his party “will act” if the Conservatives’ own parallel inquiry into the alleged betting scandal finds wrongdoing.He said: “The Gambling Commission is independent of Government – it’s independent of me.“I don’t have the details of their investigation, right? They don’t report to me, I don’t have the details, but what I can tell you is, in parallel we’ve been conducting our own internal inquiries and of course will act on any relevant findings or information from that and pass it on to the Gambling Commission.”When asked whether he had ever bet on politics whilst being an MP, the Prime Minister replied: “No.” (POOL/AFP via Getty Images)Sunak rules out he is facing probe from the Gambling Commission amid Tory betting scandal12:06 , Jabed AhmedRishi Sunak has said he was “not aware” of the Gambling Commission investigating any further Tory candidates over allegations of betting on the General Election.“The Gambling Commission don’t talk about the individuals that they are investigating,” the Prime Minister told journalists in a huddle in Edinburgh.“What I can tell you is I am not aware of any other candidate that they are looking at.”He also ruled himself out.Opinion poll round-up with 10 days to go12:00 , Jabed AhmedTwo opinion polls have been published in the past 24 hours, both of which show Labour well ahead of the Conservatives and Reform in third place.A poll by Savanta, carried out online from June 19-21 among 2,103 UK adults, gives Labour a 23-percentage point lead.The latest poll by Opinium, carried out online from June 19-21 among 2,052 UK adults, puts Labour 20 points ahead.An average of all polls with survey work completed during the seven days to June 24 puts Labour on 40%, 20 points ahead of the Conservatives on 20%, followed by Reform on 18%, the Lib Dems on 11% and the Greens on 6%.Coming up: Nigel Farage to give a speech from Kent11:57 , Salma OuaguiraNigel Farage is expected to deliver the “most important speech of the campaign so far”.Reform supporters are waiting at the Mercure Maidstone Great Danes Gotel in Maidstone, Kent for his arrival.People wait for a speech by Reform UK leader Nigel Farage at the Mercure Maidstone Great Danes Hotel in Maidstone Kent (Jordan Pettitt/PA Wire)More than half of all Londoners planning to vote Labour, according to new poll11:56 , Jabed AhmedLabour has a 33-point lead in London amid a “anti-Conservative” mood in the capital, according to a new poll.The Savanta survey for the Mile End Institute at Queen Mary University of London found 55 per cent of Londoners are planning to vote Labour with only 22 per cent Tory.The poll further found a ten per cent voting intention for the Liberal Democrats, eight per cent for Reform UK, and five per cent for the Greens.Dr Elizabeth Simon, Postdoctoral Researcher in British Politics at Queen Mary University of London, said: “The fact that over a quarter of Londoners who voted for the Liberal Democrats at the 2019 General Election are now saying they will vote Labour is likely reflective of ‘anti-Conservative’ sentiment in the capital.“There appears to be a willingness to vote tactically to minimise the chance that Conservative candidates are elected, among Londoners.”Sunak and Starmer hit back at Farage over Ukraine comments11:39 , Jabed AhmedBoth Sir Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak have hit back over Nigel Farage’s comments about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Sir Keir said he “fundamentally” disagrees with the Reform UK leader’s comments that it would be better to negotiate with Vladimir Putin.“I fundamentally disagree. Russia is the aggressor here,” he said.The Labour leader added that he had been “proud of the fact that we’ve had unity throughout our parliament” in support for Kyiv.Speaking in Scotland, the prime minister echoed these comments.“You all heard what Nigel Farage said about Ukraine,” Mr Sunak said.“That plays into Putin’s hands. That kind of appeasement is dangerous for Britain’s security, the security of our allies that rely on us and will only embolden Putin.”Labour will look at potential changes to sex education in schools, Starmer says11:32 , Jabed AhmedSir Keir Starmer has said he is opposed to “gender ideology” being taught in schools.Asked if he would rip up the ban on teaching children and young people about “gender ideology” at school, he said: “No, I’m not in favour of ideology being taught in our schools on gender.”Asked about potential changes to sex education in schools, he said: “I think we need to complete the consultation process and make sure that there is guidance that is age appropriate. That is helpful for teachers and has at its heart the safeguarding of children.” (Jacob King/PA Wire)Labour would rather ‘virtue signal to eco-zealots’ than protect jobs, Sunak claims11:30 , Jabed AhmedPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has promised to “stand full square behind Scotland’s North Sea oil and gas industry”, as he accused Labour of “virtue signalling to eco-zealots”.Speaking in Edinburgh, Mr Sunak said: “Our North Sea industry isn’t safe with Labour.”He added: “The Conservative Government that I lead will always stand full square behind Scotland’s North Sea oil and gas industry.“We’re committed to new licences, more investment in infrastructure and skills and energy security for our country. We’ll deliver a secure future for the North Sea industry and for the workers that it employs, whereas Labour want to stop all new licences in the North Sea from day one of a Labour government.“Keir Starmer and Ed Miliband want to tax the UK’s oil and gas sector and the 100,000 Scottish jobs that it supports into oblivion.”To laughter, Mr Sunak said: “But Labour don’t want to ban all oil and gas it turns out – just British oil and gas. I mean, they would rather virtue signal to eco-zealots than protect jobs here at home.”Sunak accuses Farage of ‘dangerous appeasement’ towards Putin11:30 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak has accused the Reform leader of having a “dangerous appeasement” towards Putin.He told supporters the party is “not on the side of who you think they are” referring to Nigel Farage’s claims about the war in Ukraine.During the manifesto launch in Scotland, the prime minister added: “Reform are standing candidates here in Scotland that are pro independence and anti monarchy.“And you all heard what Nigel Farage said about Ukraine. That plays into Putin’s hands. That kind of appeasement is dangerous for Britain’s security, the security of our allies that rely on us and will only embolden Putin.” (Getty Images)Starmer says he is ‘very proud’ of Labour’s record on women’s rights11:26 , Jabed AhmedSir Keir Starmer vowed to make “further progress” on gender issues, as he sidestepped a question about women’s rights.The Labour leader was challenged over why, whenever asked about women’s rights, he pivots to talking about people who identify as trans.Sir Keir told broadcasters: “I’m very proud of our record on women’s rights. As a party in government we passed really important legislation that has made a material difference when it comes to equality.“Those challenges, that progress is not over. We need to make further progress, which is why I’m really proud of what we’ve got in the manifesto that we’re putting before the country this time. And that has to be done with a sort of real determination, with a conversation and discussion which is done respecting all different views. I think we can do that and further make the progress that we need.”Scottish Tories’ manifesto framed around ‘beating the SNP'11:19 , Salma OuaguiraAt the launch of the Scottish Conservative manifesto with Douglas Ross and Rishi Sunak - ‘beating the SNP’ gets top billing pic.twitter.com/mvW4lqr8PM— Libby Brooks (@libby_brooks) June 24, 2024Sunak: ‘Only Tories can stand against SNP'11:17 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak is now on the stage presenting the Scottish Tories’ manifesto.The prime minister has attacked Scottish rivals telling supporters that the Tories are the only party to “properly stand up to the SNP” at Holyrood.He said: “A vote for the Scottish Conservatives is a vote to put this issue to bed. To move past these tired and stale arguments and to go forward united and together.”The PM added: “But that can only happen if the SNP are routed. If they do not just lose some seats but the SNP lose big. And voting Scottish Conservative is the only way to ensure that that happens.” (Getty Images)‘immediate priority’ to scrap intermediate rate of income tax in Scotland, Douglas Ross says11:17 , Jabed AhmedThe Scottish Conservatives manifesto pledges to scrap the intermediate rate of income tax in Scotland.The tax rate – which sees Scots pay 21p in the pound on earning between £26,562 and £43,662 – should be reduced by 1p, the party has said, returning it to the same rate as other parts of the UK.Speaking at the launch of the manifesto, Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross said the tax cut would be an “immediate priority” and claimed it would save the majority of taxpayers in Scotland £171 per year.Keir Starmer asked about comparisons between Tory betting scandal and Rayner council house probe11:14 , Jabed AhmedSir Keir Starmer has faced questions about why he called for Conservative candidates caught up in the alleged betting scandal to be suspended, after his deputy Angela Rayner was not suspended amid a row over her past council house, which police probed.The Labour leader said: “I think there’s a material difference and that is that the Tories caught up in this gambling escapade are openly admitting that they did it.“There’s no issue here about that. It is the middle of an election campaign and Rishi Sunak needs to show some leadership. If these were my candidates, I’ll tell you what, they’d be gone. Their feet wouldn’t have touched the floor.”Sir Keir added: “There’s a bigger argument here about politics, because the first instinct of these Tories about a General Election is not ‘what can we do for our country’ but ‘let’s see if we can make some money’ – and that is part of the change that is absolutely vital (in) the election a week on Thursday.”Greater Manchester Police dropped the probe in May and concluded Ms Rayner would face no further police action.Ross: SNP cannot ignore independence result11:11 , Salma OuaguiraDouglas Ross begins his speech describing the Tory Scottish manifesto as a “laser-focused on voter’s priorities”.Speaking from Edinburgh, he pledges to grow the economy, rebuild Scotish public services ans tackle issues “that really matter to communities”.He adds: “If the SNP do not just lose this election in Scotland but have a terrible result and are defeated right across the country – then we will have put the nationalists’ political obsession to rest for a generation.“Scotland will have again firmly said no to independence. No to more division. No to five more years of separatist campaigning and distraction. That will be a verdict that John Swinney and his SNP Government cannot ignore.” (Getty Images)The five key areas Scottish Tory manifesto is focused on11:10 , Jabed AhmedThe Scottish Tory manifesto is focused on five key areas, the document says.They are:“Repairing the roads”“Ending long NHS waits”“Restoring our schools”“Making Scotland safer”“Cutting your tax”The majority of these areas largely relate to devolved competencies of the Scottish Government in Holyrood, not the UK Government in Westminster.

(Jeff Moore/PA Wire)IFS director says huge decisions must be made over the economy and state10:47 , Jabed AhmedHuge decisions over the size and shape of the state will need to be taken by the next government, according to Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) director Paul Johnson.Addressing a manifesto analysis briefing in Westminster, Mr Johnson said taxes are at the “highest level ever” in the UK yet public services are struggling.Mr Johnson said: “Despite the high tax levels, spending on many public services will – on current plans – likely need to be cut over the next five years unless taxes are raised further or government debt raises ever upwards.”On how such a situation has emerged, Mr Johnson said: “The answer is in large part a £50 billion increase in debt interest spending relative to forecasts and a pretty big growth in the welfare budget over the last few years.“We’ve also got rising health spending, a defence budget which for the first time in decades is going to grow not shrink, and the reality of demographic change and the need to transition to net zero.”He added low economic growth and the after-effects of the pandemic and energy crisis have created a “pretty toxic mix” for public finances, and this means higher taxes or worse public services during the next government.Reform urges Labour to apologise over NHS attack10:36 , Salma OuaguiraRichard Tice has urged Wes Streeting to apologise over attacks he made to Reform UK’s health service plans on BBC Radio 4 this morning.Taking to X, formerly Twitter, the party chairman said: “Our health reform plans are of course still free at point of delivery.

32,"As the country gears up for a general election in under two weeks, young voters are relying less and less on traditional media to access the news.A substantial 21 per cent of 18- to 34-year-olds say that TikTok and Instagram have been their main source of information during the election campaign, an exclusive Techne poll for The Independent can reveal.Perhaps most surprising is that Twitter and Facebook are the least-preferred source for young voters – being chosen by just 4 per cent.While all of these platforms can share both image and video content, Instagram and TikTok have more of a skew towards visual content, while Twitter and Facebook are more centred on text-based content.All age groups under the age of 54 are more likely to turn to Instagram and TikTok for election coverage than to Twitter and Facebook, the poll suggests.On the opposite end of the spectrum, 55- to 64-year-olds are the most likely of all age groups to get their information from Facebook and Twitter, at 14 per cent.Techne UK chief executive Michela Morizzo said that the parties should take into account voters’ information preferences in their campaign strategies.“Only approximately half of upcoming general election voters rely on traditional media sources, and so we can see, only in the last five years or so, from the election in 2019, significant changes in how voters think about the political parties and where they compare their proposals. This very much affects the campaigning strategy and tools that candidates should use. It is key to correctly match the target audience with the right tools, otherwise the strategy is completely useless.”Though there has been much flurry around politicians dipping their toes into TikTok, Facebook and Twitter have been by and large the primary outlets for investment among the major parties’ social media campaigns.So if the parties are aiming to catch Gen Z voters in their net, this may not have the impact they were hoping.Recent analysis by Who Targets Me, an organisation that monitors political advertising, found that Labour had spent over £2.4m on social media advertising via Meta (which owns Facebook) and Google during this campaign.Sam Jeffers, executive director of Who Targets Me, explained that social media platforms are crucial for engaging with voters, whether via ads, news, or more lighthearted content.“The campaigns will be hoping to reach younger voters with fun, viral videos on TikTok, but they’re also going to try to find them with ads on Instagram, YouTube and elsewhere. You have to look at it all together, as part of a broader, more complicated media diet. In the end, it all adds up to the social media platforms being incredibly important in how voters, particularly younger ones, get their politics.”He added: “TikTok doesn’t allow paid political ads, so the parties can’t run their target campaigns there. But social media users tend not to spend their time on just one platform. Even if people happen to use TikTok a lot, they’ll still also hop around other services looking for interesting and entertaining stuff.”For the most part, traditional news outlets remain the preferred source of election coverage for half (48 per cent) of all voters, a figure that remains broadly similar across all age groups.Around one in 10 voters relies on the personal views of family and friends to guide them during the run-up to the general election.Young voters are least likely to turn to family and friends as a primary source of election information (8 per cent), while over-55s are most likely to do so (14 per cent).","One in five young voters prefers TikTok and Instagram for election news, poll reveals",14,9
319,"The UK will take to the polls on July 4 after prime minister Rishi Sunak called a snap general election at the end of May.Speaking outside of Downing Street, the prime minister announced that King Charles had granted his request to dissolve Parliament and promised to “fight for every vote” in the run up to polling day.The following weeks have seen fervent campaigning from all parties, as they vie for votes up and down the country. The Labour and Conservative ‘battlebuses’ are travelling far and wide to visit as many areas as possible, attempting to woo voters, and avoid gaffes along the way.Polling has remained steady since the election was called. This is probably much to the dismay of Mr Sunak, as his party lags behind. Most of the latest predictions put Labour around 20 points ahead of the Conservatives on average.All the large parties have now released their election manifestos, laying out their vision for the future of Britain. It is down to voters to decide which party they feel is best to take the country forward as they cast their ballot for the candidate they want to represent their area in parliament.To cast your vote on July 4, there’s a few things you will need to be aware of. Here’s everything you need to know about voting in the next general election.How to register to voteRegistering to vote can be done online or with a paper form.In England and Northern Ireland you can register to vote from 16, while in Wales and Scotland it’s 14. However, you must be 18 on polling day to vote in a general election.The deadline to register to vote in the July 4 general election was June 18 at 11.59pm, the Electoral Commission has confirmed. This date has now passed.You must be a British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizen, and also be resident at an address in the UK or registered as an overseas voter.You will cast a single vote for the person that you want to represent your constituency as a Member of Parliament (MP). They will either represent a political party or be standing as an independent candidate.MPs are elected using the first past the post voting system – whoever gets the most votes, wins.How to apply for a postal voteIf you’ll be away from home or abroad during the general election, you can apply for a postal vote. This means you will complete your ballot paper remotely, and post it back to your polling station.You can apply for a postal vote on the government’s website. You must first be registered to vote.You should receive your ballot paper by post around three weeks before polling day. It must be completed and sent back to the polling station in time for them to receive it no later than 10pm on polling day, so it is advisable to return it as soon as possible after you receive it.If you are unable to do so, you are allowed to take your completed postal vote directly to your local polling station before this deadline. You can hand in your own and up to five other people’s. It is an offence for a political campaigner to hand yours in if they do not know you personally.How to apply for a proxy voteA proxy vote is when someone votes on your behalf at the polling station. Similar to a postal vote, a proxy vote is for someone who is not able to physically be at the polling station on polling day.However, it is only allowed under certain circumstances.These are: being away on polling day, being registered as an overseas voter, having a medical issue or disability, and not being able to vote in person due to work or military service.You must apply for a proxy vote by 5pm, six working days before the election.However, if you are unable to vote on polling day due to circumstances such as a medical emergency or losing your photo ID, you can apply for an emergency proxy vote. You will have until 5pm on polling day to apply.What about voter ID?Following the introduction of new election laws in 2023, the July general election will be the first ever where people will be required to present a form of identification to vote.Many standard forms of ID are valid, including passports and driver’s licences.However, there are some omissions such as veteran cards, or travel passes for younger people.If you don’t possess an accepted form of ID, you can apply for a Voter Authority Certificate from the government. They are free and do not expire, but must be ordered with time to arrive before the election date.Read our guide to find out more about the new voter ID laws.",General Election 2024: How do I vote on July 4 and when is the deadline to register?,14,9
318,"The Scottish Tories' manifesto has been launched highlighting tax, the NHS and schools.Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, joined Scottish party leader, Douglas Ross, in Edinburgh and said the General Election was about “standing up to the SNP”.The manifesto pledges were heavily weighted towards issues that are the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament and not Westminster.READ NEXT:Glasgow South constituents speak ahead of electionThe manifesto promises include scrapping the 21% intermediate rate of income tax in Scotland and realigning the rate with the rest of the UK.The rate is paid on earnings between £26,562 and £43,662.Income tax is a devolved issue, voted on by MSPs at the Scottish Parliament, not MPs.The UK Tory Manifesto launched earlier in the campaign put a National Insurance cut, which is a Westminster matter, at the forefront of the party’s message.(Image: Getty)The Prime Minister said: ""Douglas and I are confident that we're going to make good progress here in Scotland and that's because people are responding very positively to the choice that's in front of them.""A vote for the Scottish Conservatives means that you're going to have your taxes cut, in contrast to the SNP making this the high-tax capital of the UK already and Labour storing up thousands of pounds of tax rises for working people.""READ NEXT: Glasgow West: Partick to Drumchapel the battle for votesOn the NHS the Conservatives said waiting lists in Scotland were too long, and said schools needed restoring.The two Tory leaders focussed their attention on the SNP, who the Conservatives will be in direct contention for several Scottish and not Labour, who polls suggest it losing power to across the UK.The Prime Minister said: ""It's only Douglas and his team that have been prepared to properly stand up to the SNP, standing against both Nicola Sturgeon's gender recognition reforms and the dangerous hate crime act. It shows you that only the Scottish Conservatives have the courage to stand up to the nationalists.""""If the SNP win the majority of seats at this election, they will treat that as a mandate to carry on campaigning for independence for another five years.A vote for the Scottish Conservatives is a vote to put this issue to bed, to move past these tired and stale arguments and to go forward united and together.""The SNP meanwhile, said the two Tory leaders are “finished”.Alison Thewlis, SNP candidate for Glasgow North said Sunak and Ross should ""compare notes on which one has run the worst campaign"".She said ""They are both on their last legs as leaders, their party is already finished in this campaign and the real choice for Scotland in this election is who is now best placed to put Scotland's interests first.""The Tories deserve the democratic drubbing that is coming their way.“From forcing Scotland out of the EU with a Brexit we didn't vote for, to Liz Truss's disastrous mini budget and the Tory cost-of-living crisis - people in Scotland have paid the price of Tory chaos and incompetence, which has left households poorer.""And in the face of relentless Tory cuts, the SNP has done all it can within its limited power to make life better for people in Scotland - lifting 100,000 children out of poverty with the game-changing Scottish child payment, scrapping peak fares on trains, and expanding free, funded childcare for families in Scotland.""",Rishi Sunak urges Scots to vote Tory for tax cuts in Scottish manifesto launch,14,1
105,"Kemi Badenoch has hinted at a potential Conservative leadership run after the general election.The Business Secretary said there was “no better job” than her current frontbench role but suggested she would be interested in the leadership opportunity, if the party loses power next Thursday.The bookmakers’ favourite to succeed Rishi Sunak, she came fourth in the contest to succeed Boris Johnson in July 2022.Mrs Badenoch spoke at a general election business hustings debate with Jonathan Reynolds, her Labour counterpart - JASON ALDEN/BLOOMBERG FINANCE LPSpeaking at a Bloomberg debate with Jonathan Reynolds, her Labour counterpart, Mrs Badenoch said: “I’m already the Secretary of [State for] Business and Trade, and it’s actually been the job of a lifetime.“I love it – there’s no better job. It is a lot easier and a lot less pressured than being prime minister. The fact of the matter is I stood and I lost, and what terrifies me now is not not becoming leader, it is seeing Labour come in.”She added: “This is one of the things that I’ve found most difficult doing this job, that people tend not to know what it is because I’m always asked the leadership question. We’re so interested in the personalities, in the gossip and so on…“We need to focus on this election. The choice is going to be between us or between them. Be afraid if it is them, is all I would say. And we will talk about leadership things after an election, but not before.”Mrs Badenoch has previously hit out at those on the Tory Right who unsuccessfully plotted against Mr Sunak earlier this year.Some of the rebels wanted to see her installed as leader, prior to a general election, but she insisted the Prime Minister had her “full support” and told those agitating for his downfall to “stop messing around”.A seat-by-seat poll by Savanta for The Telegraph last week suggested Mrs Badenoch would be the only “big beast” left standing after the election, with hopefuls including Penny Mordaunt, James Cleverly and Grant Shapps projected to lose their seats.The poll suggested the Tories would retain just 53 seats, while Labour was predicted to win a record-breaking peacetime majority of 382.At the Bloomberg debate, Mrs Badenoch claimed business was “terrified of what Labour is selling”, saying: “You should be terrified of surrendering your business and tax to Labour.”Last week, she warned Labour would reverse Brexit if it wins the general election and that Britain’s departure from the European Union should be a “10 to 20-year project” – which Sir Keir Starmer becoming prime minister would put at risk.In an interview with The Telegraph, she said she understood why voters on the Right were “frustrated” with the Conservatives but urged them not to back Nigel Farage’s Reform UK.",Kemi Badenoch hints at leadership bid ‘after election’,14,11
324,"The beautiful Surrey Hills are well known for two things: a high concentration of some of the UK’s richest residents, who commute from the “stockbroker belt” to well-paying jobs in London, and some of the country’s most popular cycling routes.The two combined on a recent chilly Saturday morning in a 100km bike ride that passed through the picturesque lanes of the newly created Godalming and Ash constituency. Most of the 10 riders from Velo Club Godalming Haslemere were happy to chat politics as they pedalled up (and down) 1,168 metres of the county’s steepest hills on customised carbon-fibre racing bikes, some of which cost more than a family car.Steve Street, 55, a retired engineering consultant who has lived in Godalming for more than 30 years, was excited about the election, as the constituency could be one of the tightest races in the country.“I hope he loses,” Street said of Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, who has held the former seat of South West Surrey since 2005. “I’ve not been that impressed with him, he appears to be a bit of a ‘yes man’ toeing the party line but not doing what makes sense for the country.”InteractiveIf Hunt does lose, he will join a list of just 35 cabinet members who have been defeated while holding office since 1900.In Street’s view, the Conservatives are “no longer the party of business”. They lost him with Brexit, which still makes him angry. “I disagreed with it from the start but as it was the will of the people I agreed we’d better go ahead and do it. But I think it’s been badly implemented and caused so many issues for industry and businesses, and messed up the economy.”Street voted Liberal Democrat in 2019, partly to punish the Conservatives for Brexit. Many others also turned to the Lib Dems, whose share of the vote in the constituency increased from 9.9% in 2017 to 38.7%. Hunt retained the seat with 53.3% and a majority of 8,817.InteractiveThis time pollsters predict it will be one of the closest races in the country, with the Lib Dems’ Paul Follows – the leader of the local Waverley borough council – expected to win with 38%, ahead of Hunt on 33.4%. Under current projections, Labour could come in third with 13.1%, just ahead of Reform on 12.9%.Despite the tightness of the race, Street said he was considering voting Labour this time around. “I’m looking for the party that is going to be pro-business. Labour is pitching itself as very pro-business and I think that could be enough for me to vote for them, maybe.”While Street has earned enough to retire in his early 50s, he said he would like whichever party that wins the election to do more to tackle “the widening gap between rich and poor”.“It’s always talked about as a north-south divide,” he said. “But there are places down south that are very poor. Even here, which is a very rich area, there are pockets of real deprivation.”He said Hunt had “shown himself as out of touch with real people” with his comments earlier this year that £100,000 a year was “not a huge salary”. “It’s such a stupid statement, and it’s the sort of thing that sticks in people’s memories,” Street said.defaultA lot of the voters the Guardian spoke to over several days in the constituency described Hunt as a good local MP, often seen at town and village events and supportive of local charities. The Guardian bumped into Hunt at the annual Godalming town parade and show, at which he repeatedly described himself as “the underdog” in the election.While many voters came up to chat warmly with Hunt and his labrador, Poppy, some challenged him on local, national and international issues, including on the party’s stance on the war in Gaza.Anushka Athique, 42, a lecturer who lives in the neighbouring town of Farncombe, said she “couldn’t pass up the opportunity to speak my mind to him – if I hadn’t I would have gone away feeling a coward”.“I have been writing to him fortnightly about the war in Gaza and the need for an immediate ceasefire,” she said. “He has never replied.”Athique said she hadn’t decided who to vote for “but I’ll do whatever I have to do to get him out”. Asked why, she said: “Just look at every job he has done, every job he has fucked it up: culture secretary, fucked it up; health secretary, really fucked it up; chancellor, the country is bust.”Gaza was also on the mind of Penny Rivers, 67, who has lived in Godalming since 1974. “I’m voting Lib Dem as they are the only major party that has called for an immediate ceasefire,” she said. “We are hoping to have a Labour government and a Lib Dem MP. We hoped for it last time, but this time we are much more hopeful. People are tired and fed up, we need change.”Rivers said people may think of Surrey as “leafy and well-to-do, but people are suffering here just like everywhere else”. She said the cost of living crisis may have hit poorer families in Surrey more than elsewhere as “we have such high housing costs compared to incomes”. “There are now two food banks in Godalming,” she added. “It’s down to austerity and the Tory government.”She said she would like the government to do more for younger people. “We’re old and have had all sorts of advantages that today’s young people can’t imagine. We have four children, all of whom can’t afford to own their own homes despite having good, well-paid jobs.” Her eldest child is 40 and still renting. “We bought our house when I was 24,” she said.Rivers said she knew Hunt well, and she was soon seen giving him a bear hug. “He is a good local MP and has stepped up in various ways,” she said. “But he is part of the national government that has failed the people.”She had one more thing to say before letting go of the Guardian reporter’s arm. “You know the worst thing about this government? It’s the war on woke. Woke means caring for people and it can only be a good thing to care for people no matter what.”Robert Oulton, a Labour party member, was not at the Labour stall at the town fair. Instead he was manning a rival stall calling on people to “vote smart. Vote together. Vote for change … Vote for Paul Follows, the only candidate that can beat the Conservatives here.”Oulton, 70, a retired GP who lives in Farncombe, said he had made the decision in effect to campaign for the Lib Dems because “the country so desperately needs change, we can’t go on like this. We need to get the Tories out, so it has to be tactical voting.”He said he had met a lot of other people who were “on the journey” to tactical voting. “Whether they be Labour or Greens, they are very aware of the situation.”However, Oulton and his fellow activists hadn’t convinced everyone of the merits of tactical voting. Peter Lockhart, 58, who lives in the village of Shalford, near Guildford, is a lifelong Labour member and will be voting for the party’s candidate, James Walsh, on 4 July. “Labour is my community,” Lockhart said. “It chimes with my worldview, despite some frustrations.”Lockhart said he had sympathy with the tactical voting argument but “we want people to vote with their heart”.In the village of Bramley, which was in the midst of a tap water crisis after petrol was found to have leaked into the water supply, Sylvie Thomas, 82, was unafraid to speak frankly. “We’re in so much of a mess, it’s all promises and lies,” Thomas said as she proudly showed off her immaculate home and garden decorated in West Ham United’s claret and blue in memory of her father who played for the team. “They [the Conservatives] have been in too long, it is time for a change.”Max Aiken, 76, an artist and retired architect, didn’t want to vote for any of the candidates on the ballot paper. “I was hoping for something more radical, I’m looking around for someone like [French president Emmanuel Macron], but I’m looking in vain.”Aiken voted Conservative at the last election, but in Bath, and had only recently moved to the village of Cranleigh. “The Tories are promising to fix everything next time, but they have had 14 years and haven’t fixed much,” he said.“I’m not a Lib Dem, and I don’t think [Keir] Starmer is the answer. I don’t think the country knows what the answer is,” he said. “What we really need is someone with a handbag with a brick in it.”",‘I hope he loses’: Jeremy Hunt facing uphill battle in Godalming as voters long for change,14,8
114,"Labour has clarified its position on transgender rights as Wes Streeting says the party would “modernise and reform” gender laws if it comes into power on July 4.The shadow health secretary has said Labour’s policy aims to allow transgender people to “live their lives with freedom, dignity and respect”. His comments come after all the major parties unveiled their manifestos over the past few weeks, outlining their visions for the country. Each covers transgender policy, with the issue becoming a major cultural talking point over the past few years.For the latest updates ahead of the general election, follow The Independent’s live coverageUnder current UK legislation, the ability to change legal sex is enshrined in the 2004 Gender Recognition Act. This followed a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) which found that the previous inability to do so in the UK was a breach of certain human rights.The 2010 Equality Act defines sex in binary terms as ‘a reference to a man or woman’ – but this can be changed. A trans person can change their legal sex by obtaining a Gender Recognition Certificate, amending the sex category on their birth certification. However, they must also meet certain criteria to do so.Simplifying the gender reassignment processLabour has said it wants to “simplify” the process of changing gender in the UK. Speaking to The Times, shadow women and equalities secretary Anneliese Dodds said the party’s plans would see the system become “modernised”.“This means stripping out the futile and dehumanising parts of the process for obtaining a gender recognition certificate, while retaining important safeguards.”Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer (Stefan Rousseau/PA) (PA Wire)Current legislation requires someone to have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, have been living with their affirmed gender for two years, and intend to live in that gender for the rest of their lives.A panel will then consider the application, only if it is accompanied by two medical reports. At present, only 2 per cent of transgender people in the UK have a certificate.Labour’s manifesto does not provide more detail on the measures, so it is likely it would undergo consultation should the party come into power after the July general election.Changing the definition of sexThe Conservatives have taken a different approach to gender recognition law. The party has pledged to introduce new legislation which would change the definition of sex to mean ‘biological sex’, or sex at birth, should they secure another term in July.The measure would allow single-sex services and spaces to legally bar transgender people without falling foul of discrimination law. Speaking in early June, women and equalities minister Kemi Badenoch said: “the protection of women and girls’ spaces is too important to allow the confusion to continue.”Women and equalities minister Kemi Badenoch (Stefan Rousseau/PA) (PA Wire)“Whether it is rapists being housed in women’s prisons, or instances of men playing in women’s sports where they have an unfair advantage, it is clear that public authorities and regulatory bodies are confused about what the law says on sex and gender and when to act”.The government’s proposed changes would also make gender recognition a reserved matter which only Westminster can legislate on. This comes after Scotland’s Gender Recognition Reform Bill was blocked by the UK government in 2023 for clashing with UK-wide legislation.Implementing the Cass ReviewBoth parties have committed to implementing the recommendations of the Cass Review: a landmark report on gender identity services for children and young people in the UK. It was commissioned by NHS England in 2020 and published in April 2024 following an interim report in 2022.At nearly 400 pages, the review is complex and far-reaching, with author Dr Hilary Cass making several recommendations. Key points include strongly discouraging social gender transition before the age of 18, and withdrawing puberty blockers from medical practice (a step already underway in England).Dr Hilary Cass after the Cass Review’s publication (Yui Mok/PA) (PA Wire)The report was largely accepted by medical professionals in the UK as a positive step in gender-related care. It acknowledges the care required by gender dysphoric youth and recommends their expansion, including regional services and support up to age 25.However, some groups have criticised the report for the possible consequences it could have. LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall UK has said it is “concerned” that some of the recommendations could lead to “children and young people being denied the care that they need.”Meanwhile, Amnesty UK and Liberty warned that the review “is being weaponised by people who revel in spreading disinformation and myths about healthcare for trans young people.”Teaching gender in schoolsLooking to education, the Conservatives have vowed to ensure “the concept of gender identity” is not taught to children. It comes alongside the ban on sex education for under-9s.To enforce this, the government says they will provide guidance for teachers that must be followed.Labour has not committed to undo this measure if in power, as their education spokesperson Bridget Phillipson discussed the issue in May.Speaking on BBC One, she said that the Conservatives’ proposals had “good and straightforward principles” in it, while other aspects drifted into unhelpful “partisan” language. Ms Phillipson implied the party would review the measures if in power, but it does not make an appearance in Labour’s manifesto.",What are Labour and the Conservative positions on transgender rights ahead of the 2024 general election?,14,9

But while the economic news is good, with inflation coming down, the polls are still heavily against the Tories.The last general election was in 2019, when Boris Johnson and the Tories won 365 seats, while Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour won 202. Since then, both parties have switched leaders — in some cases, more than once — not to mention Brexit coming into effect and a worldwide Coronavirus pandemic.So what are the polls saying? If Mr Sunak was hoping to wait for the polls to swing in his favour before calling the election, he was sorely mistaken.With Nigel Farage now leading Reform, the right-wing challenger party is just three points behind the Tories, at 16 per cent of voter intention.Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour has a 24-point lead in the latest poll on voter intentions from Techne UK, with the Tory-Labour gap remaining as wide as ever.After a dip in the polls following Mr Sunak’s election announcement, the Tories have made little gains with voters.At just 19 per cent of the vote, the Conservatives are at their lowest levels of popularity with the electorate under Mr Sunak.Meanwhile the Lib Dems are at 11 per cent, after being neck-in-neck with Reform for the past few months, gunning for the spot of third-highest polling party.Both parties appear to be picking up support from historical Tory voters.Labour have polled consistently in the region of 44 per cent and the Conservatives have been shedding more points since January.Although it is not entirely clear why Mr Sunak chose now to go to the polls, one in four people believe that the prime minister was hoping to benefit from recently improved inflation figures, according to a Redfield and Wilton poll for the Independent.If that is the case, the Tories have seen no joy when it comes to voter intention.The latest data is taken from 1,630 surveyed individuals across the UK, weighted to be representative of the population.Satisfaction with both Mr Sunak and Sir Keir remains poor, according to a separate monthly poll by Ipsos UK.The general public has been overall dissatisfied with both the prime minister and Sir Starmer, with Ipsos polls showing negative net satisfaction consistently for both party leaders since Mr Sunak entered No. 10 in November 2022.Mr Sunak’s approval rating fell to the ranks of lowest-ever for a prime minister in April, at -59 per cent approval; matched only by John Major in August 1994. This is lower than Liz Truss, whose net approval rating was at -51 per cent for her brief stint as prime minister.The data is taken from 1,000 British adults surveyed each month, answering the question: “Are you satisfied/dissatisfied with how ... is doing his job as prime minister/as leader of the Labour Party?”Despite low figures overall, satisfaction has jumped for the Labour leader in the past month, with a 13-point boost from -31 per cent to -18 per cent.Mr Sunak saw a 5-point jump in the same period, from -59 per cent to -55 per cent. This puts Mr Starmer at a 37-point lead in net satisfaction.An exclusive Independent poll from Redfield and Wilton shows that the economy tops the list of issues that are most important to voters, at 37 per cent. With inflation finally slowing down (at 2.3 per cent as of May), the economy could be a key button for the Tories to press; if the general public can look beyond the past two years.Meanwhile, healthcare is the most important issue for 1 in 5 voters at this election, in the wake of widespread strikes, pandemic strains, and scandals across the NHS including the infected blood inquiry and sky-high waiting lists.Migration is also a dividing concern among voters, with both Labour and the Tories pledging to cut numbers.",General election polls: Are Labour or the Conservatives on track to win in July?,14,9

225,"Rishi Sunak will warn that it would take decades to recover from the “disaster” of a Labour government as he seeks to rally Tories to fight for every vote in the closing stages of the General Election campaign.The Prime Minister will tell activists they have just 10 days to “take our message to every corner of the United Kingdom” before polls open on July 4.With the Conservatives still around 20 points behind in the polls and after a bruising few days dominated by allegations about alleged insider betting, Mr Sunak will urge Tories not to “surrender” to Sir Keir Starmer’s party.The Prime Minister will launch the Scottish Tory manifesto and address a campaign event in London at the start of the last full week of campaigning.His latest intervention comes with him under pressure from within the Conservative Party to take a tougher stance against those being investigated by the Gambling Commission for betting on the election date.According to extracts of his speech briefed to the Daily Mail, Mr Sunak will say: “We have 10 days to take our message to every corner of the United Kingdom.“To make the argument that this country needs lower taxes, not £2,000 more taxes for every working family.“To make the case that a Labour government would be bad for our country, and an unchecked Labour government would be a disaster from which it would take decades to recover.”(PA Graphics)Labour has repeatedly denied Tory claims that it is planning to increase taxes on working families.But Mr Sunak will say: “When a politician won’t tell you what they are going to do, it means that they know you won’t like it.“All their evasions tell you is that they are going to whack up council tax and a bunch of other taxes.“And one thing we know about Keir Starmer is that he has no problem going back on his promises. His career is a story of commitments dropped as soon as they became too difficult to keep.“I tell you this: once you have handed Keir Starmer and Labour a blank cheque, you won’t be able to get it back.”In an attempt to boost Tory morale, Mr Sunak will say: “Don’t surrender to Labour. Fight for every vote, fight for our values, fight for our vision of Britain.”The Conservative campaign has been plunged into a deeper crisis by the gambling controversy, with the party’s chief data officer Nick Mason understood to be taking a leave of absence amid claims he placed bets on the election date.Director of campaigning Tony Lee has also taken a leave of absence, while Mr Lee’s would-be MP wife Laura Saunders and fellow candidate Craig Williams, who was a parliamentary aide to the Prime Minister, are also under investigation by the Gambling Commission.Home Secretary James Cleverly said he was not aware of any ministers caught up in the betting row (Lucy North/PA)Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris faced questions about how wide the inquiry might go as he was sent out on the airwaves for a faltering broadcast round on Monday morning.The minister said it would be wrong to “suggest somebody is guilty until proven innocent” when asked why the Prime Minister would not take what former defence minister Tobias Ellwood called “robust action”.Asked whether Mr Sunak should ask Mr Williams when he placed his bet, the Northern Ireland Secretary told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It wouldn’t surprise me in the slightest if that conversation has been had, but you asked me if I knew, and I don’t.”He suggested the Conservative Party does not know whether the Tory candidate had insider knowledge when he placed his bet or whether it was “just a hunch”.“There’s both a principle point and a practical point there,” Mr Heaton-Harris told LBC when asked why Mr Williams had not had party backing withdrawn pending the inquiry.“It needs to be determined whether or not he had prior knowledge.”Asked how damaging the scandal was, he said: “It’s not great because we should be talking about how we’re going to lower taxes and how we’re going to lower immigration.”Mr Ellwood on Monday joined a growing chorus of senior Tory voices calling for the Prime Minister to take action over the allegations.The Conservative candidate for Bournemouth East said the inquiries were a “deeply unhelpful, self-inflicted distraction” and suggested Mr Sunak should have suspended those being investigated.Ministers have been pressed on whether members of Cabinet could be involved after the Prime Minister repeatedly refused to say whether he could confirm his top team would not face allegations.Asked if ministers had bet on the date, Home Secretary James Cleverly told the BBC: “Not to my knowledge.”Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove compared the impact of the row with the Partygate scandal.“It looks like one rule for them and one rule for us,” he told the Sunday Times, adding: “That’s the most potentially damaging thing.”Mr Gove went on to suggest it was “just not acceptable” for those in a “privileged position” close to the Prime Minister to use what he described as “inside information to make additional money for yourself”.Mr Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer will face questions from Sun readers on Monday afternoon in the latest set piece of the election campaign.Labour is set to focus on health issues, raising concerns about “DIY dentistry” because of a lack of NHS treatment.Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: “It’s virtually impossible to get a dentist appointment after 14 years of Conservative neglect.“People are resorting to pulling their own teeth out – DIY dentistry should be the stuff of Charles Dickens’ books, not Britain in 2024.”",Sunak warns Labour government would be ‘disaster’ as he battles to save campaign,14,4
301,"The Conservatives have launched their own inquiry into whether politicians or officials gambled on the timing of the election, Rishi Sunak has said, as the prime minister denied that he had placed any bets himself.Sunak told reporters he was not aware of any further candidates being looked into and was not himself being investigated, saying he had never bet on a political event.The prime minister said he did not have further details of the investigation but Conservative campaign headquarters would “act on any relevant findings or information”.Four Tory candidates and officials are under investigation by the Gambling Commission, including Sunak’s top parliamentary aide, the candidate for Montgomeryshire and Glyndŵr, Craig Williams; its candidate in Bristol West, Laura Saunders; her husband and the party’s director of campaigning, Tony Lee; and the party’s chief data officer, Nick Mason, who has denied wrongdoing.An unnamed Metropolitan police officer who is part of Sunak’s close protection security team has also been arrested in connection with the inquiry into bets placed on a July election.Labour wrote to the head of the Gambling Commission on Sunday urging the watchdog to name those it had placed under investigation “in the public interest”, saying that “ongoing speculation … is casting a shadow over the election”.George Osborne, the former Conservative chancellor, told his Political Currency podcast earlier this month that about 40 people knew the date of the election in advance.Tobias Ellwood, the Tory former minister and candidate in Bournemouth East, said Sunak should be doing more to limit the damage, “given the scale of this, as we see now, and the potential for the story to continue to eclipse, to overshadow, the election.“I’m not sure anyone, including the prime minister, could have predicted the number of people involved when the story first broke. The public wants to see clearer, robust action.”Ellwood also said he thought the scandal would cost the Conservative party seats. “I have no doubt about it,” he said.Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, who is standing down as an MP, was asked if he thought Sunak should have suspended the two candidates being investigated. He said they should remain until the investigation was complete. “I think what you’re trying to suggest is that someone is guilty until they’re proven innocent and that is not how this works,” he said.Keir Starmer rejected the suggestion that MPs should be banned outright from gambling after the scandal. Speaking at a school in Kettering, the Labour leader said: “I’m not sure we need to start changing the rules. The rules actually aren’t the problem here, there’s a problem with the politicians. The moment the election was called they didn’t say give me a microphone and let me make my case, they said let me head down to the bookies.”",Tories launch internal inquiry into election date betting,14,8
268,"Sir Keir Starmer has said he would offer to pay if he saw a parent shoplifting baby formula.The Labour leader told the Big Issue: “I’d offer to pay it. The desperation of families around the country should make the Tories feel nothing but shame.“Of course, shoplifting is a problem for businesses, so we’d have 13,000 more neighbourhood police to provide reassurance on our high streets.“But we’d also change the rules so people could use food bank vouchers and loyalty card points to buy baby formula,” he added.Necessary baby food items are now commonly kept locked or have security tags on them - JAMES LINSELL/SWNSSir Keir and John Swinney, the leader of the SNP, both said they would get out their wallets for a parent deemed “clearly in need” stealing baby formula.The Labour leader echoed comments made by Sadiq Khan, the London Mayor, earlier this year, who said he would offer to pay if he saw a parent shoplifting baby products.Meanwhile, Rishi Sunak said he would not, and told the magazine: “Shoplifting is not a victimless crime and we’ll always support shopkeepers to prevent theft.“At the same time, we will continue to help parents with the cost of living.”Sir Ed Davey said that he would “try to persuade [the parent] not to, obviously“, adding that to “try and find them other help, that would be the best way of doing it.”Mr Swinney, the Scottish First Minister, said: “I’d discreetly offer to pay as no parent should ever have to face this situation.“Sadly, this is not hypothetical – I meet with my constituents, and people across Scotland, every week who face this kind of hardship.”In April, Mr Khan told the Big Issue: “What upsets me is the tags you have now, on nappies and baby foods, because of the issue that is in relation to somebody who is shoplifting.“In the hypothetical case, I suspect I’ll take my wallet out, and I would pay for it.”",Keir Starmer: I would pay if I saw parent shoplifting baby formula,14,11
241,"Senior Conservatives and campaigners are calling for a ban on political bets by MPs, as the Gambling Commission was urged to look into another £500 wager connected with the growing election gambling scandal.The former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said parties should examine the rules when parliament returns amid growing outrage over Tory candidates and aides allegedly staking money on politics. The former defence minister Tobias Ellwood also said there should be new restrictions.The Conservatives have launched their own inquiry into whether politicians or officials gambled on the timing of the election. Rishi Sunak was forced to deny having placed any bets himself and told reporters he was not aware of any further candidates under scrutiny.“We’ve been conducting our own internal inquiries and of course will act on any relevant findings or information from that and pass it on to the Gambling Commission,” he said.The Gambling Commission has been urged to investigate a flurry of unusual activity around the time Sunak called the election, an industry source told the Guardian.It includes a bet of £504, placed on the Sunday before the election was called, that Sunak would still be PM before the 2024 election. The implication is that the punter may have known that the election call was imminent, thus giving the Tory party no time to replace Sunak.Marginal odds meant the punter stood to gain only £35 from the bet. Details of the bet have been provided to the commission by a professional gambler.Earlier this month the Guardian revealed that the gambling watchdog had written to all licensed bookmakers requesting information on anyone who stood to gain more than £199 by betting on the timing of the election. The scope of the investigation is understood to include bets placed against an autumn election as well as those placed on a summer one.Another gambling industry source said more junior figures may emerge as the commission conducts background checks on the hundreds of people who placed bets on the timing of the poll in the days before Sunak announced the date.Four Tory candidates and officials are under investigation by the Gambling Commission: Sunak’s top parliamentary aide, Craig Williams, the candidate for Montgomeryshire and Glyndŵr; the Tory candidate in Bristol West, Laura Saunders; her husband and the party’s director of campaigning, Tony Lee; and the party’s chief data officer, Nick Mason, who has denied wrongdoing.An unnamed Metropolitan police officer who is part of Sunak’s close protection security team has been arrested in connection with the inquiry.Duncan Smith said the public took a “dim view” of politicians who gambled on politics. “I am opposed to people associated with politics betting on political outcomes in general because they’re too close to it,” he said. “It also looks casual if you’re betting on stuff that affects people’s quality of life.“You can either do it by the party saying it won’t be tolerated, or you could do it by legislation. If you start relying on legislation, it would be a complex process. Parties are capable of saying that anyone who does this shouldn’t be in the party. They can move quicker than governments.“But one way or the other, it needs to be made clear that the public takes a dim view of it and it shouldn’t happen. It’s a matter for the next parliament.”Ellwood told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme it was comparable to the rules placed on the stock market. “Let’s introduce clear rules, as you have in the City in connection to the purchase of stocks and shares, for example. Let’s prevent any current politician or party professional from placing any bets in the future,” he said.It is understood that Labour is not planning any action on restricting political betting by its candidates or staff, as long as the bets are not placed with any insider information.Speaking at a school in Kettering, Keir Starmer said: “I’m not sure we need to start changing the rules. The rules actually aren’t the problem here; there’s a problem with the politicians. The moment the election was called, they didn’t say, ‘Give me a microphone and let me make my case,’; they said, ‘Let me head down to bookies.’”Other senior politicians and campaigners have joined calls for bets to be restricted. Don Foster, the Liberal Democrat peer and chair of Peers for Gambling Reform, said all betting on elections should be banned.“The current rules are incredibly opaque and this farrago is a good illustration,” he said. “My personal view is that after the election, we should clarify the rules, including saying that gambling companies should not be allowed to take bets on the outcome of, or anything relating to, elections at any level within the UK.”Will Prochaska, of the Coalition Against Gambling Ads, said: “Political betting should be banned, along with betting on anything other than sports or horse racing. It’s totally inappropriate for the gambling industry to offer a market for political betting, not least because it tempts those with inside information to try and make a few quid, but also because it normalises the idea that we should bet on anything and everything, which is not normal.“In the absence of a complete ban, clearly, politicians and their staff should not be able to gamble on political events. We need to protect politics from people who view it as chance to make a quick buck.”",Senior Tories call for ban on political bets by MPs after election scandal,14,8

I love it. There’s no better job.“It is a lot easier and a lot less pressured than being prime minister.“The fact of the matter is, I stood and I lost. And what terrifies me now is not not becoming leader, it is seeing Labour come in.”She continued: “This is one of the things that I’ve found most difficult doing this job, that people tend not to know what it is, because I’m always asked the leadership question. We’re so interested in the personalities, in the gossip and so on...“We need to focus on this election. The choice is going to be between us or between them. Be afraid if it is them, is all I would say. And we will talk about leadership things after an election, but not before.”Political leaders wish Princess Royal a speedy recovery13:39 , Joe MiddletonPolitical leaders have wished Princess Anne a speedy recovery after she suffered minor injuries to her head and a concussion when it is believed she was kicked by a horse on her Gatcombe Park estate.The Princess Royal, 73, an Olympic-medal-winning horsewoman, was walking on her Gloucestershire estate on Sunday evening when the incident happened.Emergency services were despatched to the estate and, after medical care at the scene, the princess was transferred to Southmead Hospital in Bristol for appropriate tests, treatment and observation.Prime minister Rishi Sunak said: “Everyone in the country is immensely fond of Her Royal Highness. We’re all sending her our best wishes for a swift recovery.”Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: “Wishing Her Royal Highness a speedy recovery and sending my best wishes on behalf of all of us at the Labour Party.”Labour dodges question about European Court of Justice role in new EU deal13:26 , Andre LangloisShadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds has dodged a question about whether a future Labour government would accept a role for the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in a future deal with the European Union.Taking questions during Bloomberg’s Business Debate, Mr Reynolds said: “We’re not going to give away our negotiating hand entirely but... the argument on food and agricultural products is this: do you want lower standards than the European Union?“If you don’t want lower standards, surely we remove pragmatically some of those checks and balances to make sure we can have as close a relationship as is possible, to remove some of those costs. There will still be costs because we’re not going to talk about going back into a customs union.”Tory business secretary Kemi Badenoch described his response as “astonishing” and added: “What would they have to give up in order to get that? That is the question that they don’t want to answer, saying it’s part of their negotiating hand.”She accused Labour of trying to take the country “back into the EU without saying so” and said: “We cannot allow any kind of oversight from the ECJ – that’s not something that you should be keeping in your back pocket. That’s something that you need to be honest about with the British public.”Mr Reynolds hit back: “This is a conversation on one side, on the Conservative side, which is all about to be frank the next leadership election in the Conservative Party and the red lines within there.”Watch: Tory minister reveals how he would bet on election 'if he was allowed'13:17 , Joe MiddletonKemi Badenoch and Jonathan Reynolds clash over climate and net zero commitments13:12 , Jabed AhmedBusiness secretary Kemi Badenoch and her Labour counterpart Jonathan Reynolds have clashed over whether net zero is an opportunity to be seized or cost to be mitigated.Speaking at Bloomberg’s UK Election 2024: The Business Debate, Mr Reynolds said: “It’s an opportunity. I mean, it couldn’t be any clearer than that – it’s one of the greatest opportunities that has ever existed and actually for the UK, when you think about some of that regional inequality that we are very familiar with, that the transition could be something that isn’t just an opportunity in itself, (but it) actually addresses some of the real long, deep-seated problems within the British economy.“And the job of Government around that is not to deliver that itself, of course it’s not, it’s to build and shape the markets that the private sector will then operate around.”Ms Badenoch responded: “It is both. When we decided that net zero was going to be a policy, this was a cross-party thing. It wasn’t just Conservatives. There is no major party that has said it does not want the net zero target by 2050, but that was in 2018. Look at what happened since then – Covid and a war in Ukraine that’s completely changed the landscape for what that meant.”The Business Secretary added: “Yes, it can be an opportunity, but we need to make sure that we deliver other things on a no-regrets basis.”Mr Reynolds responded and added Labour had altered its £28 billion climate pledge.Rachel Reeves weighs in on Tory election betting scandal13:03 , Jabed AhmedRishi Sunak has shown an “astonishing lack of leadership” by failing to suspend Conservatives facing investigation into betting on the date of the General Election, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has insisted.Ms Reeves said Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer had “been really clear” that “if this had been Labour candidates, their feet would not have touched the ground”.Speaking during a visit to a windfarm in East Renfrewshire, the shadow chancellor said: “When wrong doing takes place in Labour, candidates are suspended. That is not an easy thing to do but it is the right thing to do.”She stated: “It is an astonishing lack of leadership from Rishi Sunak that these candidates are still in place, they have still got the Conservative rosette.“Rishi Sunak is now so weak he is not even able to suspend people who are accused of profiteering from inside information. It is frankly one rule for Conservative candidates and staffers and another rule for everybody else.”She added: “In the end voters will judge the Conservatives on their 14 years and sleaze, the abuse of public office, is quite high in people’s minds. It is one of the reasons why people want change after 14 years of chaos and decline” (Reuters)Reform leader claims Labour in power would be ‘even more incompetent than Tories’12:58 , Salma OuaguiraNigel Farage has claimed that if Labour gets into Downing Street, it would be “even more incompetent than the Conservatives”.The Reform leader said: “I believe this Labour government will get into trouble very, very quickly. They will prove to be, if it is possible, even more incompetent than the Conservatives have been.“And as he tries to take us back to EU rules, as we get more lunacy on trans laws and everything else, you will find a government and a Parliament split from its people.“So my ambition is for us to establish a bridgehead in Parliament on July 4 and over the course of the next five years to build up a mass movement for common sense, for decency, to represent the silent majority in this country.”Farage doubles down on small boats ‘invasion’ attack12:53 , Salma OuaguiraNigel Farage has claimed he was right to describe migrants crossing the Channel in small boats an “invasion”.He doubled down on Reform’s pledge to ditch the European Court on Human Rights as he criticised Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda scheme.He said the UK was “not meanspirited or nasty” but people coming to the UK illegally would never be granted refugee status unless they pay taxes and obey the law.

They can’t convince anyone to back Slippery Starmer and they know there is no love for the Labour Party on the doors, so they’ve resorted to campaigning for Reform in the hope they can stop Conservatives being elected.“Many people across our country are very worried about a Labour Government, and now the cat is out of the bag. A vote for Reform is a vote for Labour and Slippery Starmer.”Farage blasts Tories ‘greedy and stupid’ over betting scandal12:46 , Salma OuaguiraNigel Farage has attacked the Conservatives over the betting scandal engulfing the party.The Reform leader told supporters in Maidstone: “The sheer level of greed and stupidity that leads people right at the heart of government, who know when the election is going to be called, to put on bets is astonishing but perhaps sums up the self-entitled view that this Conservative Party has after 14 years in government.”Mr Farage claimed the current accusations against Tories are just the “tip of the iceberg” and predicted “this scandal will get worse”.Farage: ‘I take no lectures from Labour’12:38 , Salma OuaguiraNigel Farage has responded to attacks made by the main parties on his controversial comments on Ukraine.Speaking from the top of a double-decker bus, he has doubled down on statements about the war and western involvement.He said: “I won’t be lectured by the Conservative party or Sir Keir Starmer. This is the same Starmer who backed Corbyn to leave NATO. So, no thank you.”The Reform leader took aim at Starmer’s pledge to scrap a law protecting Nortern Ireland veterans from prosecution, the Legacy Act. And blasted: “Along with David Lammy, he wants us to join the European Defence Union.” (REUTERS)Sunak responds after IFS slams Tory and Labour manifestos12:38 , Jabed AhmedRishi Sunak has responded to the Institute for Fiscal Studies’ (IFS) analysis of the major parties’ manifestos.Earlier today IFS director Paul Johnson said both the Conservative and Labour manifestos “essentially ignore” some of the “big challenges” in the economy.Facing questions about the analysis, the prime minister said: “No, I don’t agree with that. We have a fully costed manifesto which can deliver tax cuts for people at every stage in their lives and that is largely funded by making sure that we can find some savings in the growth of the welfare budget, because it’s been growing at unsustainable levels since the pandemic.“We’ve set out a very clear plan to reform that, to support people into work, and in fact, the IFS acknowledge that last time around they said that that wasn’t possible, that it was actually delivered, and that’s something that the IFS themselves have said.“Labour in contrast don’t think you can save a single penny from the welfare bill, which is already where we’re spending more than on transport, schools, law enforcement. I don’t think that’s right. I want to deliver tax cuts for people and constraining the increase in the welfare budget is the right way to do that to support people in work.”Farage brands Boris ‘liar’ over Putin12:26 , Salma OuaguiraNigel Farage has branded Boris Johnson a “liar” in a fierce attack for the prime ministe’s criticism over his comments on Ukraine.He unveiled a giant version of an i newspaper frontpage from 2016 with the the headline “Boris blames EU for war in Ukraine”.The Reform leader also said he will not apologise for claiming that the invasion by Russia was “provoked” by the West.He said: “I can’t take those words away. The fact that I was more far-sighted than more politicians is not something I’ll apologise for.”Despite the comments, he condemned Putin’s actions, adding: “None of this justifies what he’s done. And who knows - he may have done it anyway. But we gave him to give his people a reason for doing so.“And you think I’m on my own in thinking this? The Pope in 2022 - it’s not often the Pope and I are on the same side of any debate particularly - I’m a bit more Henry VIII. But the Pope made this point in 2022.” (REUTERS)Nigel Farage is speaking from Maidstone12:22 , Salma OuaguiraThe Reform leader claims his party represents “the new kids on the block” and is the topic of conversation during this election capaign.Speaking in Maidstone, he jokes about his grandchild’s birthday: “I want to make a little announcement. Yesterday was 23 June the anniversary of Brexit. It was also yesterday that my first grandchild was born. I don’t think I’ll ever forget when his brithday is.”He adds: “We are doing rather well. There is more conversation about Reform than anything going on in this campaign that’s partly because Sunak and Starmer are simply so monotone, dull, and don’t say anything believable.”Nigel Farage speaking at the Mercure Maidstone Great Danes Hotel in Maidstone Kent (Jordan Pettitt/PA Wire)Conservatives running parallel inquiry to the Gambling Commission, Sunak says12:10 , Jabed AhmedPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has said his party “will act” if the Conservatives’ own parallel inquiry into the alleged betting scandal finds wrongdoing.He said: “The Gambling Commission is independent of Government – it’s independent of me.“I don’t have the details of their investigation, right? They don’t report to me, I don’t have the details, but what I can tell you is, in parallel we’ve been conducting our own internal inquiries and of course will act on any relevant findings or information from that and pass it on to the Gambling Commission.”When asked whether he had ever bet on politics whilst being an MP, the Prime Minister replied: “No.” (POOL/AFP via Getty Images)Sunak rules out he is facing probe from the Gambling Commission amid Tory betting scandal12:06 , Jabed AhmedRishi Sunak has said he was “not aware” of the Gambling Commission investigating any further Tory candidates over allegations of betting on the General Election.“The Gambling Commission don’t talk about the individuals that they are investigating,” the Prime Minister told journalists in a huddle in Edinburgh.“What I can tell you is I am not aware of any other candidate that they are looking at.”He also ruled himself out.Opinion poll round-up with 10 days to go12:00 , Jabed AhmedTwo opinion polls have been published in the past 24 hours, both of which show Labour well ahead of the Conservatives and Reform in third place.A poll by Savanta, carried out online from June 19-21 among 2,103 UK adults, gives Labour a 23-percentage point lead.The latest poll by Opinium, carried out online from June 19-21 among 2,052 UK adults, puts Labour 20 points ahead.An average of all polls with survey work completed during the seven days to June 24 puts Labour on 40%, 20 points ahead of the Conservatives on 20%, followed by Reform on 18%, the Lib Dems on 11% and the Greens on 6%.Coming up: Nigel Farage to give a speech from Kent11:57 , Salma OuaguiraNigel Farage is expected to deliver the “most important speech of the campaign so far”.Reform supporters are waiting at the Mercure Maidstone Great Danes Gotel in Maidstone, Kent for his arrival.People wait for a speech by Reform UK leader Nigel Farage at the Mercure Maidstone Great Danes Hotel in Maidstone Kent (Jordan Pettitt/PA Wire)More than half of all Londoners planning to vote Labour, according to new poll11:56 , Jabed AhmedLabour has a 33-point lead in London amid a “anti-Conservative” mood in the capital, according to a new poll.The Savanta survey for the Mile End Institute at Queen Mary University of London found 55 per cent of Londoners are planning to vote Labour with only 22 per cent Tory.The poll further found a ten per cent voting intention for the Liberal Democrats, eight per cent for Reform UK, and five per cent for the Greens.Dr Elizabeth Simon, Postdoctoral Researcher in British Politics at Queen Mary University of London, said: “The fact that over a quarter of Londoners who voted for the Liberal Democrats at the 2019 General Election are now saying they will vote Labour is likely reflective of ‘anti-Conservative’ sentiment in the capital.“There appears to be a willingness to vote tactically to minimise the chance that Conservative candidates are elected, among Londoners.”Sunak and Starmer hit back at Farage over Ukraine comments11:39 , Jabed AhmedBoth Sir Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak have hit back over Nigel Farage’s comments about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Sir Keir said he “fundamentally” disagrees with the Reform UK leader’s comments that it would be better to negotiate with Vladimir Putin.“I fundamentally disagree. Russia is the aggressor here,” he said.The Labour leader added that he had been “proud of the fact that we’ve had unity throughout our parliament” in support for Kyiv.Speaking in Scotland, the prime minister echoed these comments.“You all heard what Nigel Farage said about Ukraine,” Mr Sunak said.“That plays into Putin’s hands. That kind of appeasement is dangerous for Britain’s security, the security of our allies that rely on us and will only embolden Putin.”Labour will look at potential changes to sex education in schools, Starmer says11:32 , Jabed AhmedSir Keir Starmer has said he is opposed to “gender ideology” being taught in schools.Asked if he would rip up the ban on teaching children and young people about “gender ideology” at school, he said: “No, I’m not in favour of ideology being taught in our schools on gender.”Asked about potential changes to sex education in schools, he said: “I think we need to complete the consultation process and make sure that there is guidance that is age appropriate. That is helpful for teachers and has at its heart the safeguarding of children.” (Jacob King/PA Wire)Labour would rather ‘virtue signal to eco-zealots’ than protect jobs, Sunak claims11:30 , Jabed AhmedPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has promised to “stand full square behind Scotland’s North Sea oil and gas industry”, as he accused Labour of “virtue signalling to eco-zealots”.Speaking in Edinburgh, Mr Sunak said: “Our North Sea industry isn’t safe with Labour.”He added: “The Conservative Government that I lead will always stand full square behind Scotland’s North Sea oil and gas industry.“We’re committed to new licences, more investment in infrastructure and skills and energy security for our country. We’ll deliver a secure future for the North Sea industry and for the workers that it employs, whereas Labour want to stop all new licences in the North Sea from day one of a Labour government.“Keir Starmer and Ed Miliband want to tax the UK’s oil and gas sector and the 100,000 Scottish jobs that it supports into oblivion.”To laughter, Mr Sunak said: “But Labour don’t want to ban all oil and gas it turns out – just British oil and gas. I mean, they would rather virtue signal to eco-zealots than protect jobs here at home.”Sunak accuses Farage of ‘dangerous appeasement’ towards Putin11:30 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak has accused the Reform leader of having a “dangerous appeasement” towards Putin.He told supporters the party is “not on the side of who you think they are” referring to Nigel Farage’s claims about the war in Ukraine.During the manifesto launch in Scotland, the prime minister added: “Reform are standing candidates here in Scotland that are pro independence and anti monarchy.“And you all heard what Nigel Farage said about Ukraine. That plays into Putin’s hands. That kind of appeasement is dangerous for Britain’s security, the security of our allies that rely on us and will only embolden Putin.” (Getty Images)Starmer says he is ‘very proud’ of Labour’s record on women’s rights11:26 , Jabed AhmedSir Keir Starmer vowed to make “further progress” on gender issues, as he sidestepped a question about women’s rights.The Labour leader was challenged over why, whenever asked about women’s rights, he pivots to talking about people who identify as trans.Sir Keir told broadcasters: “I’m very proud of our record on women’s rights. As a party in government we passed really important legislation that has made a material difference when it comes to equality.“Those challenges, that progress is not over. We need to make further progress, which is why I’m really proud of what we’ve got in the manifesto that we’re putting before the country this time. And that has to be done with a sort of real determination, with a conversation and discussion which is done respecting all different views. I think we can do that and further make the progress that we need.”Scottish Tories’ manifesto framed around ‘beating the SNP'11:19 , Salma OuaguiraAt the launch of the Scottish Conservative manifesto with Douglas Ross and Rishi Sunak - ‘beating the SNP’ gets top billing pic.twitter.com/mvW4lqr8PM— Libby Brooks (@libby_brooks) June 24, 2024Sunak: ‘Only Tories can stand against SNP'11:17 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak is now on the stage presenting the Scottish Tories’ manifesto.The prime minister has attacked Scottish rivals telling supporters that the Tories are the only party to “properly stand up to the SNP” at Holyrood.He said: “A vote for the Scottish Conservatives is a vote to put this issue to bed. To move past these tired and stale arguments and to go forward united and together.”The PM added: “But that can only happen if the SNP are routed. If they do not just lose some seats but the SNP lose big. And voting Scottish Conservative is the only way to ensure that that happens.” (Getty Images)‘immediate priority’ to scrap intermediate rate of income tax in Scotland, Douglas Ross says11:17 , Jabed AhmedThe Scottish Conservatives manifesto pledges to scrap the intermediate rate of income tax in Scotland.The tax rate – which sees Scots pay 21p in the pound on earning between £26,562 and £43,662 – should be reduced by 1p, the party has said, returning it to the same rate as other parts of the UK.Speaking at the launch of the manifesto, Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross said the tax cut would be an “immediate priority” and claimed it would save the majority of taxpayers in Scotland £171 per year.Keir Starmer asked about comparisons between Tory betting scandal and Rayner council house probe11:14 , Jabed AhmedSir Keir Starmer has faced questions about why he called for Conservative candidates caught up in the alleged betting scandal to be suspended, after his deputy Angela Rayner was not suspended amid a row over her past council house, which police probed.The Labour leader said: “I think there’s a material difference and that is that the Tories caught up in this gambling escapade are openly admitting that they did it.“There’s no issue here about that. It is the middle of an election campaign and Rishi Sunak needs to show some leadership. If these were my candidates, I’ll tell you what, they’d be gone. Their feet wouldn’t have touched the floor.”Sir Keir added: “There’s a bigger argument here about politics, because the first instinct of these Tories about a General Election is not ‘what can we do for our country’ but ‘let’s see if we can make some money’ – and that is part of the change that is absolutely vital (in) the election a week on Thursday.”Greater Manchester Police dropped the probe in May and concluded Ms Rayner would face no further police action.Ross: SNP cannot ignore independence result11:11 , Salma OuaguiraDouglas Ross begins his speech describing the Tory Scottish manifesto as a “laser-focused on voter’s priorities”.Speaking from Edinburgh, he pledges to grow the economy, rebuild Scotish public services ans tackle issues “that really matter to communities”.He adds: “If the SNP do not just lose this election in Scotland but have a terrible result and are defeated right across the country – then we will have put the nationalists’ political obsession to rest for a generation.“Scotland will have again firmly said no to independence. No to more division. No to five more years of separatist campaigning and distraction. That will be a verdict that John Swinney and his SNP Government cannot ignore.” (Getty Images)The five key areas Scottish Tory manifesto is focused on11:10 , Jabed AhmedThe Scottish Tory manifesto is focused on five key areas, the document says.They are:“Repairing the roads”“Ending long NHS waits”“Restoring our schools”“Making Scotland safer”“Cutting your tax”The majority of these areas largely relate to devolved competencies of the Scottish Government in Holyrood, not the UK Government in Westminster.

The economy has flatlined for 14 years. That is exactly what we are wanting to change, that’s why we’ve set out our plans for growth in our manifesto.“So, the choice is more stagnation as we’ve seen for the last 14 years, which hasn’t done our country any good, or turn the page, rebuild, regrow our economy and create wealth so that, across Britain, people feel better off.”11:02 , Salma OuaguiraComing up: Rishi Sunak set to launch Scottish Tories’ manifesto10:54 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak is expected to appear alongside Douglas Ross to unveil the Tories’ Scottish manifesto.The prime minister and the Scottish Conservative leader are set to make a speech at an event in Edinburgh.Rishi Sunak set to join Douglas Ross to launch Scotland's election campaign manifesto (Getty Images)Ed Davey visits Wimbledon ambulance station10:51 , Jabed AhmedLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey donned overalls and a hi-vis jacket to clean an ambulance during a campaign visit in target seat Wimbledon in south-west London.On his visit to Wimbledon ambulance station, he chatted to staff and stroked post-traumatic stress disorder assistance dog Teddy.The dog was wearing a harness stating “Do not pet”.The Lib Dem leader then used a jet wash to hose down an ambulance, catching watching photographers as the spray bounced off the vehicle.He was making the visit to highlight his warning that there are now just “10 days left to save the NHS”. (Jeff Moore/PA Wire)IFS director says huge decisions must be made over the economy and state10:47 , Jabed AhmedHuge decisions over the size and shape of the state will need to be taken by the next government, according to Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) director Paul Johnson.Addressing a manifesto analysis briefing in Westminster, Mr Johnson said taxes are at the “highest level ever” in the UK yet public services are struggling.Mr Johnson said: “Despite the high tax levels, spending on many public services will – on current plans – likely need to be cut over the next five years unless taxes are raised further or government debt raises ever upwards.”On how such a situation has emerged, Mr Johnson said: “The answer is in large part a £50 billion increase in debt interest spending relative to forecasts and a pretty big growth in the welfare budget over the last few years.“We’ve also got rising health spending, a defence budget which for the first time in decades is going to grow not shrink, and the reality of demographic change and the need to transition to net zero.”He added low economic growth and the after-effects of the pandemic and energy crisis have created a “pretty toxic mix” for public finances, and this means higher taxes or worse public services during the next government.Reform urges Labour to apologise over NHS attack10:36 , Salma OuaguiraRichard Tice has urged Wes Streeting to apologise over attacks he made to Reform UK’s health service plans on BBC Radio 4 this morning.Taking to X, formerly Twitter, the party chairman said: “Our health reform plans are of course still free at point of delivery.

77,"In yet another example of how there’s more than one election taking place in Britain, Rishi Sunak has lent his presence to the launch of the Scottish Tories’ manifesto in Edinburgh. In fact the Prime Minister’s attendance was a sort of reminder that the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party is, of course, still a part of the larger UK party. So far.But that formal situation is the only thing currently uniting the two because the campaigning on either side of the Cheviots is entirely different. In the south the Tories are trying desperately to hang onto some sort of respectability in terms of constituencies retained, when the opinion polls are suggesting a massive hammering is on the cards and a hugely reduced number of MPs.Whereas, in Scotland – and for a change, as of now at least – the Tories won’t exactly set the political world on fire but there’s a degree of hope that they might emerge from the July 4 poll with roughly the same number of seats – six – that they secured in 2021.It should be said that the half dozen might not be the same seats, but would be seen as a minor triumph, given the devastation expected to be visited on the party in England.The hope of such an outcome is probably the reason why big-time Tory figures from England are notable only by their absence in this almost exclusively Scottish election. The presence of the prime minister of the United Kingdom during the campaigning is obviously a “must” for the premier party of the Union but there seems to be a view in the Scotland party that “one is enough” in terms of prominent Tory visitors travelling north to join in the campaign. And that one is the PM. No more.The Scottish party is not without its rows and in-fighting, given the abrupt disposal of a candidate in a winnable seat and his replacement by Douglas Ross, the Scottish leader, is a prime example. But it is on a minuscule scale, when compared to the battles, scandals and sleaze that have seemed to emerge regularly in England.Rishi Sunak helps launch the Scottish Conservative manifesto in Edinburgh on Monday - Wattie CheungAs a result bringing senior Cabinet figures north at this present time would be of no benefit in the Scottish party’s fight. Furthermore, and not surprisingly, the issues in Scotland are different from those in England. The SNP’s obsession with independence is the Scottish Tories’ main line of attack, which they say hampers voters’ “real” priorities of education, transport, the NHS and law and order.All of these are devolved to the Scottish Parliament so can’t be fixed by the July 4 election and won’t be sorted by the Tories until they form a government at Holyrood, a situation not likely to occur any time soon.However, the Scottish Tories could do reasonably well on the issue of North Sea oil and gas by cutting through the morass of conflicting policies being offered up by the SNP and Labour. Sunak and Ross want to keep the “black gold” flowing, to protect Britain’s energy future and the well-paid jobs that go with it, whereas their opponents favour drastic reductions and a high tax regimen for the oil companies.Saving the current oil and gas industry from cutbacks and eliminating entirely the SNP’s perpetual – and lone – demand for independence are where the Tories hope they can actually win seats.In an otherwise unexciting manifesto launch, those who like a bit of blood and thunder with their politics heard the prime minister launch into a direct attack on Nigel Farage, whom many Tories on the Right seem to think is their salvation.That’s far from the case in Scotland and Sunak didn’t hold back, claiming that Reform had candidates that were pro-independence and anti-monarchy.Rishi Sunak and Douglas Ross in Edinburgh on Monday - Edward Massey/CCHQAnd regarding Farage’s assertion that the West was partially at fault  for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, he said: “That plays into Putin’s hands. That kind of appeasement is dangerous for Britain’s security, the security of our allies that rely on us, and will only embolden Putin.” Quite right.",Sunak and Ross launch manifesto in land where there is still hope,14,11
102,"Keir Starmer has defended serving in Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, saying he wanted to help preserve the Labour party and that he “always knew there was going to be a day after”.Speaking in separate interviews hosted by the Sun newspaper that included questions from a watching audience, Rishi Sunak and Starmer underwent at times difficult interrogations, including over migration and the NHS.Both party leaders were quick to dismiss the record of their predecessors. Rishi Sunak said Liz Truss’s economic policy was badly mistaken and claimed that a Starmer-led government would create similar fiscal instability. Starmer meanwhile gave his fullest answer yet as to why he had endorsed Corbyn in the 2019 election when he did not believe in him, and why he did not quit to serve on the backbenches as some colleagues had.“Everybody then took a decision about what they did, how we dealt with this,” he said. “I felt that on issues such as Brexit, which I thought were going to define us for decades to come, leaders are temporary, but political parties are permanent, but it was important to have a voice in the shadow cabinet.“It meant that I could challenge on antisemitism, and it meant that the Labour party never veered from its position on things that are fundamental, like Nato,” he said.The entire Corbyn period was, Starmer said, “very difficult for me and for my party”, but he had to look towards the future.“I knew there would be a day after, where we needed to pick it up, to say to the electorate: ‘In 2019, we got this wrong’, and rebuild – we were all working to that end,” he said. “Everybody knew there was always going to be a day after, when we would have the opportunity for a new party, and to make sure our party was there to face the future.”Sunak sought to argue that Labour would be as damaging to the economy as Truss, as he was challenged about the impact of the short-serving prime minister.Asked if he felt “some responsibility for inflicting Liz Truss on the voters”, Sunak stressed that he had fought Truss for the Conservative leadership and warned against her plans.“I was right then, when I warned about Liz Truss. That’s why all of you can trust me now,” he said. “I have also warned about the damage that Keir Starmer would do to our economy. I was saying something that no one wanted to hear, but I was saying it because I believed it. And I’m telling you again now, it all seems a bit familiar.“If Keir Starmer is your prime minister, the economy is going to suffer and all of you are going to suffer. I don’t want to see that happen.”In another pointed remark, Sunak argued that Labour’s decision to scrap the Rwanda deportation plan for asylum seekers would see a rush in arrivals.“Those illegal migrants will not be on planes to Rwanda,” he said. “They will be out on our streets, putting pressure on public services – and by the way, I can tell you now they are queueing up in Calais, waiting for a Starmer government so they can come here and stay here.”Rishi Sunak stopped off in Chelsea after the debate to deliver a brief stump speech to Tory activists. Greg Hands, a trade minister and former Tory chair who was elected with a 11,000 majority in 2019, is seeking re-election in the west London seat.Sunak told local activists he was “not blind to people’s frustrations with me, with our party”, but said “this election is not a referendum on me”. He said Keir Starmer had “changed his mind on every major position that he has taken, including just the other day U-turning on his U-turning about supporting Jeremy Corbyn” and accused the Labour leader of threatening the security of women with his policy on transgender rights.",Sunak says Truss’s budget was mistaken as Starmer defends backing of Corbyn,14,8

It is a lot easier and a lot less pressured than being prime minister. The fact of the matter is I stood and I lost, and what terrifies me now is not not becoming leader, it is seeing Labour come in.“This is one of the things that I’ve found most difficult doing this job, that people tend not to know what it is because I’m always asked the leadership question. We’re so interested in the personalities, in the gossip and so on.“We need to focus on this election. The choice is going to be between us or between them. Be afraid if it is them is all I would say. And we will talk about leadership things after an election, but not before.”Mrs Badenoch has previously hit out at those on the Tory Right who unsuccessfully plotted against Mr Sunak earlier this year.Some of the rebels wanted to see her installed as leader prior to a general election, but she insisted the Prime Minister had her “full support” and told those agitating for his downfall to “stop messing around”.A seat-by-seat poll by Savanta for The Telegraph last week suggested Mrs Badenoch would be the only “big beast” left standing after the election, with hopefuls including Penny Mordaunt, James Cleverly and Grant Shapps projected to lose their seats.The poll suggested the Tories would retain just 53 seats, with Labour predicted to win a record-breaking peacetime majority of 382.Last week, Mrs Badenoch claimed Labour would reverse Brexit if it wins on July 4 and that Britain’s departure from the European Union should be a “10 to 20-year project” – which she said would be put at risk by Sir Keir Starmer becoming prime minister.In an interview with The Telegraph, she said she understood why voters on the Right were “frustrated” with the Conservatives but urged them not to back Nigel Farage’s Reform UK.",Badenoch hints at Tory leadership bid after election,14,11

The leaders did not go head to head and instead were given 30-minute slots to answer audience questions.The debate announcements were confirmed after the Tories had pressed Sir Keir to take part in a record six debates during the six-week election countdown.Conservative sources had dubbed the opposition leader “the knight that won’t fight” and “Sir Fear Starmer” after he failed to sign up to their weekly debate demand.Labour headquarters indicated instead that their leader would take part in two head-to-head debates against Mr Sunak, matching what Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn did ahead of the 2019 election.What channels are the debates on?The BBC, ITV and Sky News have hosted debates in an array of formats in the race to the general election.All broadcasts from the BBC are available on BBC1, BBC News and are live on the corporation’s streaming platforms BBC Iplayer.The BBC also confirmed they will air several debates on local radio.ITV will show their programmes on their main channel ITV1, as well as their steaming service ITVX.

186,"Rishi Sunak has announced a general election for July 4, as the country prepares for its first national vote since 2019.Here, The Telegraph examines the processes involved, including how votes are called and who can take part.When is the general election?Why is there an election now?Why was the general election not on the same day as the local elections?What happens next?How are general elections called?How often are elections called?Who can vote in the general election?When should I register to vote?When will polling take place?When is the general election?The general election will take place on July 4 as the country heads to the polls between 7am and 10pm to have their say on the next prime minister. It had looked likely that Rishi Sunak would wait until the autumn to call the next election, but the Prime Minister announced in a rain-sodden speech outside of Downing Street on May 22 that July 4 was the chosen date.Follow The Telegraph’s live general election coverageMany assumed Mr Sunak would want more time for the new Rwanda deterrent and recent tax cuts to take effect, having described a ballot in the second half of the year as his “working assumption”.But speculation reached fever pitch in Westminster when the Conservatives refused to rule out an election being called that day. That afternoon, an umbrella-less Mr Sunak announced his snap election decision and set in motion the vote to happen six weeks later on July 4.The choice means that Mr Sunak will have been in No 10 for 618 days by the polling date and has been called a “mistake” by figures like Prof Sir John Curtice, the polling expert.Why is there an election now?Tory figures close to general election planning had also been working under the assumption there was not going to be a summer ballot, but that all changed on May 22.Lord Cameron cut a trip to Albania short in order to return to a Cabinet meeting and Grant Shapps delayed a flight to a Nato meeting two hours to be there.On the day of the announcement, news came that the rate of inflation had fallen even further than expected, which Mr Sunak hailed as a sign that “everything is heading in the right direction”.With the Government’s record perhaps at its strongest on the economy, the Prime Minister was keen to use the news as a launchpad for triggering the election – but what else played into his decision?Key factors for the Prime Minister would have included whether economic statistics was continuing to improve, and whether polling and focus group research suggested that voters were feeling the positive effects of the National Insurance cuts, crediting the Tories for the boost.Getting Rwanda deportation flights off the ground also strengthened the case for going to the polls in the summer, along with a steady decline in the NHS elective waiting list.It had been rumoured that figures in Downing Street were mulling over whether it would be in the Tories’ interests to trigger a ballot sooner rather than later, despite being way behind Labour in the polls.Why was the general election not on the same day as the local elections?The general election could have been called on May 2 - the same day as the locals - but Mr Sunak made the decision to avoid a spring poll.The Institute for Government pointed out that a spring election would avoid the risk that “a heavy defeat in the local elections could increase pressure on the Prime Minister – including from within his party – and make it difficult to regain momentum ahead of an election that would by then be less than a year away”.However, that opportunity passed. On March 14, the Prime Minister ruled out a national ballot on May 2, confirming there “won’t be a general election on that day”.It was thought that heavy losses at the locals could tempt restless Tory MPs to mount a challenge against their leader.However, despite a dire set of results for the Conservatives, resulting in hundreds of council seats lost, the rebels appear to have backed off for now.What happens next? Following Mr Sunak’s announcement on May 22, Parliament was prorogued and dissolved eight days later on May 30 after the Prime Minister was granted permission by the King Charles.Prorogation happened on May 24, in line with the 2022 Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act that sets out polling day to take place 25 working days following the dissolution on May 30, landing the general election on July 4.Election candidates have begun to use the six-week lead up to ballot day to campaign for their parties, including both Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer who have undertaken appearances up and down the country.Both leaders, and many other political figures, have also taken part in TV election debates in a bid to win over voters and released their 2024 party manifestos, starting with the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives. It is up to each party when to publish its manifesto, but an analysis by the Institute for Government shows that all Labour and Conservative manifestos since 1997 have been launched between 18 and 29 days before the election.How are general elections called?It is up to the Prime Minister to decide when to hold a national vote, but this power has only been restored in recent years.In 2011, the Fixed Term Parliaments Act effectively put the House of Commons in charge, with general elections held every five years unless a majority of MPs willed it otherwise.For an election to be called early, two thirds of the House had to back the plans. This is how Theresa May’s snap election was triggered in 2017. Alternatively, MPs could spark a ballot by passing a vote of no confidence in the Government.After trying and failing three times to secure the necessary two thirds majority for an early vote in 2019, the Tories opted to circumvent the law with a new purpose-built piece of legislation - the Early Parliamentary General Election Act - which required only a simple majority to pass. This paved the way for Boris Johnson’s snap election in 2019.The Government went on to repeal the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, replacing it with the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act. This new law stripped the Commons of its power to block an early ballot, putting the Prime Minister back in control.Traditionally, the Prime Minister travels to Buckingham Palace to request the dissolution of Parliament, before returning to Downing Street to announce the forthcoming election.How often are elections called? Each Parliament must be dissolved for a general election by the fifth anniversary of the day it first met.This measure was passed under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act by the 2011 coalition government, which set in stone the five-year periods between general elections.Elections may be held earlier – such occurred in 2017 with Theresa May and 2019 by Boris Johnson following a Brexit deadlock – under special circumstances.However, local elections such as the May 2024 by-elections and mayoral elections operate on a different time scale. Who can vote in the general election?The vast majority of UK adults can vote in a general election.In order to vote, you must:be registered to votebe 18 or over on the day of the election (‘polling day’)be a British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizenbe a resident at an address in the UK or Gibraltar, or living abroad and registered as an overseas voter (it is also possible to register if you have no fixed address)not be legally excluded from voting (for example, if you are serving a prison sentence)When should I register to vote?The deadline for registering to vote has now passed. Registration usually stays open until midnight at the end of the 12th working day before polling day, meaning the window closed on June 18 at 11.59pm. The deadline to vote by post passed the following day at 5pm.For those who are registered, it is still possible to apply for a proxy vote until 5pm on June 26.When will polling take place?Parliament was dissolved a few days after the election announcement and polling day takes place 25 working days after that.The Civil Service has entered “purdah” – the period between an election being called and polling day which involves strict restrictions on the work of officials to ensure that Whitehall resources are not being used to benefit any party in particular.",When is the general election?

And you all heard what Nigel Farage said about Ukraine.”He launched the manifesto alongside Douglas Ross, the outgoing Scottish Tory leader, who is standing in Aberdeenshire North and Moray East.The document made five key pledges – repairing the roads, ending long NHS waits, “restoring our schools”, making Scotland safer, and “cutting your tax”.Ian Murray, Labour’s shadow Scottish secretary, said: “Douglas Ross and Rishi Sunak are hoping Scots will suddenly forget the last 14 years where a Tory government crashed the economy, sent mortgages and prices soaring and partied during the pandemic.”Richard Thomson, the SNP candidate for Gordon and Buchan, said: “After 14 years of disaster after disaster from Westminster, it’s clear the Tories’ obsession with the SNP is all they have left.”",Independence is ‘dead for a generation if SNP is routed in general election’,14,11

40,"Britain’s top trade union leader has warned Sir Keir Starmer that he will have to tackle a “dangerously underfunded” fire service as one of his first priorities on becoming prime minister.Matt Wrack, the general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) and president of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), has told the Labour leader that fire and rescue services are in a state of emergency.It comes as Starmer entering Downing Street as prime minister on 5 July is now seen as almost inevitable with Labour more than 20 points ahead in most opinion polls.Speaking to The Independent, Mr Wrack warned that the UK is “dangerously underprepared” for responding to fires, floods and extreme weather events, and has called on Keir Starmer to rapidly invest in the fire and rescue service when he enters Number 10.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will have a lot in his inbox when, as expected, he becomes prime minister (Aaron Chown/PA)The FBU has claimed that responses to national emergencies and major incidents including wildfires, heatwaves, and flooding have been impeded by a lack of resilience over the past two years.It comes as he unveils the Firefighters’ Manifesto which sets out the FBU’s vision for the future of the fire service. It advocates investment to address a crisis caused by a lack of resources, deregulation and cuts. Firefighters are calling on all parliamentary candidates to pledge their support for the manifesto.Across the UK, one in five firefighter jobs have been cut since 2010 with 82 fire stations and 17 control rooms have been closed down.Fire and rescue services frequently fail to meet their own targets for fire cover. The average response time for fire brigades to arrive at the scene has risen to a record nine minutes and 12 seconds across England. This is an increase of more than a minute in the last 10 years.Several fire and rescue services across the UK have adopted a new policy of sending firefighters out in crews of three instead of the minimum of five firefighters needed to respond to incidents where lives are at risk.They are often forced to wait for additional crews to arrive before tackling a serious incident, wasting crucial time needed to save lives.The document highlights the case study of 19 July 2022, as temperatures soared, the London Fire Brigade had its busiest day since the Second World War and ran out of fire engines to respond to incidents. But 39 fire engines sat idle in fire stations because there were not enough firefighters to crew them.Matt Wrack, TUC president, has issued a warning to Starmer (Clive Gee/PA) (PA Wire)It also points out that in the wake of flooding caused by Storm Babet in October 2023, a record 72 calls went unanswered or were deferred in Northamptonshire alone as resources ran out.Mr Wrack said: “When Keir Starmer enters 10 Downing Street, the crisis in the fire and rescue service will be one of the most important things in his in-tray.“The UK is dangerously underprepared and under-resourced when it comes to keeping communities safe from fires, floods and other disasters. To turn things around, we will need significant investment.“Under the Tories, one in five firefighter jobs have been cut, as has 30 percent of central government funding. This has led to the worst response times in history, and a hollowing out of national resilience.“Firefighters are regularly pushed beyond safe limits. Every day, public safety is put at risk because of a lack of resourcing.“The incoming government must face the emergency.”",Starmer warned rescuing ‘dangerously underfunded’ fire service must be a first priority as prime minister,15,9
278,"Sir Keir Starmer will hold a national summit on knife crime every year to hold law enforcement and technology companies to account on behalf of victims.The Labour leader said the party’s aim to halve knife crime incidents within a decade would be a “moral mission” at the heart of an incoming Labour government.He also pledged to bring families of victims and survivors of knife attacks into a cross-government coalition of government ministers, councils and tech firms so that their voices can be heard.Shawn Seesahai was murdered in a park in Wolverhampton by two 12-year-old boys - WEST MIDLANDS POLICE“Knife crime is an issue above and beyond party politics,” he said ahead of a meeting on Tuesday with victims’ families where he will set out Labour’s policy.“For the parents grieving sons and daughters who never came home, action to end this scourge cannot wait. Far too often we hear the same stories from grieving families who have been subject to these brutal murders carried out by children.“It is our duty as political leaders of all stripes to work together to end knife crime and keep our young people safe.“Cutting knife crime will be a moral mission for the next Labour government. Our new cross-government coalition will put knife crime victims and their families at the heart of government, working with us to take the strongest action in a generation to end this tragic crime.”It comes as knife crime nationally has risen by 7.2 per cent to nearly 50,000 offences, close to the past record high of 51,200, according to the Office for National Statistics. One in four police forces including the West Midlands and the Metropolitan Police recorded their highest-ever knife crime rates in 2023.It follows the conviction of two 12-year-old boys for the knife murder of Shawn Seesahai, 19, in a Wolverhampton park in November last year. They are thought to be the youngest killers convicted since the murder of the toddler James Bulger in Merseyside in 1993 by the 11-year-olds Robert Thompson and Jon Venables.Sir Keir has pledged that no young person caught with a knife will escape sanction under Labour such as jail, tagging, curfew, fine or behavioural contracts.Under its Young Futures programme, every area will be expected to identify the young people most at risk of being drawn into violent crime, with a package of support that responds to the challenges they are facing.Labour’s manifesto also pledged new laws that would result in tech firm executives facing up to two years in jail if banned zombie knives and machetes were sold on their platforms. The party plans to extend the list of banned weapons.The measures would be similar to those in the Online Safety Act by holding executives personally to account through “tough sanctions” if their firms flout rules on sales of ninja swords, zombie-style blades and machetes.Chris Philp, the policing minister, said: “When Keir Starmer was in charge of the Crown Prosecution Service, convictions for weapon possession fell, and knife crime has risen by 20 per cent in Labour-run London.“The choice at the election is clear: cracking down on crime with Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives, or back to square one with Keir Starmer and the same old Labour who consistently fail to tackle crime.”",Starmer to hold annual summit on knife crime for ‘grieving families’,14,11

The Conservatives won it with a majority of 9,423 in 2019.“Two weeks out from the Olympics, if we are competing against the Conservative Party my teammates and I would be saying they are a shower of s---,” Mr Cracknell said in the video, posted on his Facebook page on Saturday.“And if one of my teammates got caught for cheating, they’d be dead to me.

Nick Mason, the party’s chief data officer, has denied wrongdoing.Craig Williams, Rishi Sunak’s parliamentary private secretary, Tony Lee, the Tory director of campaigning, and Laura Saunders, Mr Lee’s wife, who is standing in Bristol North West, are also under investigation by the Gambling Commission.The Prime Minister said on Monday that the Tories were conducting an internal inquiry into the scandal and that he was “not aware” of any other candidates being accused of having placed a bet on when the election would be held.Mr Cracknell said: “So why am I still canvassing and delivering leaflets? Because I believe the Conservative way is the best for the country – freedom to succeed, protection of our national security and personal responsibility. If any party deserves to have the Union Jack on its literature, it’s the Conservative Party.”He also vowed to not “blindly defend things that have gone on in the past that I don’t agree with” if elected as the city’s MP.“I’ve a pretty strong moral compass, and believe in right or wrong, and there’s things that have been wrong,” he said in an interview with The Guardian on Monday.“I’m just going to be really honest if I agree with something or not.

I would call them up and ask them ‘did you do it’. If they did it, they’d be suspended.“But the prime minister will have to answer why he hasn’t done it.

220,"Rishi Sunak should suspend any Tories who placed bets on the general election date, a Government minister has suggested.Steve Baker, the Northern Ireland minister, said if it were up to him, anyone who admitted to gambling on the timing of the ballot would be temporarily kicked out of the party.He said it was for the Prime Minister to explain why he hadn’t taken any action to date, adding he had “no inside information” on Mr Sunak’s reasoning.It will pile further pressure on the Prime Minister to suspend those caught up in the scandal, with Craig Williams, a Tory candidate and one of his closest aides, having already admitted to putting “a flutter” on the general election some weeks ago. He now faces an inquiry by the Gambling Commission.Laura Saunders, another Conservative candidate, and her husband Tony Lee, the party’s director of campaigning, are also being investigated by the watchdog over alleged betting on the election date.Speaking to ITV’s Peston on Monday night, Mr Baker said: “If they placed bets it was disreputable and I would call them up and ask them, did you do it? And if they did it, then they are suspended.”He added: “But the Prime Minister would have to answer why he hasn’t done it, I haven’t got inside information on why the Prime Minister hasn’t done it.”Tobias Ellwood, the former Tory defence minister, also argued on Monday that Mr Sunak should have suspended the Conservative candidates caught up in the betting scandal.Asked if the Prime Minister should have taken that action, he told the BBC: “Given the scale of this as we see now and the potential for this story to continue to eclipse, to overshadow the election, I would now agree.“I am not sure anyone, including the Prime Minister, could have predicted the number of people involved when this story first broke. The public want to see clear, robust action now.“The practical dilemma you face, though, is were individuals responding to the whirlwind of the rumour mill around Westminster at the time… about a pending election announcement, or were they in the room when the decision was made?“If it was the latter, the party can take immediate action. Otherwise it is for the Gambling Commission to rightly make that judgement.”On Monday, Mr Sunak, who has ordered an internal inquiry to run separately to the Gambling Commission’s investigation, said he was “incredibly angry when I learned about the allegations, as everybody would be when they would hear about something like that”.He said he was not aware of any other Tory candidates being investigated but stressed that any internal inquiries by the Conservative Party must not “compromise the integrity of… police and other investigations”.Meanwhile, Sir Iain Duncan-Smith said that he was “opposed to people associated with politics betting on political outcomes in general”.The former Tory leader told The Guardian: “You can either do it by the party saying it won’t be tolerated, or you could do it by legislation. If you start relying on legislation, it would be a complex process.“Parties are capable of saying that anyone who does this shouldn’t be in the party. They can move quicker than governments.”He added: “But one way or the other, it needs to be made clear that the public takes a dim view of it and it shouldn’t happen.

In 2016, I supported other candidates, but our membership returned him as the leader. But that was very difficult for me and for our party, because I thought that we were not going to be heading in the right direction. Everybody then took a decision about what they did, how we dealt with this.He added: “I felt that on issues such as Brexit, which I thought were going to define us for decades to come, leaders are temporary, but political parties are permanent.“But it was important to have a voice in the shadow cabinet, and it meant that I could challenge on anti-Semitism, and it meant that the Labour Party never veered from its position on things that were fundamentally important, like Nato.”He said that he had “reflected” on his time serving in Mr Corbyn’s shadow Cabinet, he said: “ I think it was right to fight, I think, in my case it was right to fight from within the Shadow Cabinet”06:17 PM BSTStarmer: No Labour leader ‘has ever done anything as serious’ to change the Labour PartySir Keir Starmer has said that “no  Labour leader has ever done anything as serious” as expelling Jeremy Corbyn from the Labour Party.He told The Sun: “Look at my leadership on this. I picked up the Labour Party, I recognised many people had not voted for us last time, possibly people in this room and I said, ‘we’re never going to put that proposition in front of the electorate again. I’m not going to tell to the electorate, what do you think you’re doing?’ I’m going to say to my party, we need to shake this up and change it.“So I’ve changed the Labour Party, so there’s a fundamentally different choice at this election. And Jeremy Corbyn not only lost the whip as a Labour MP, he’s now been expelled from the Labour Party. No Labour leader has ever done anything as serious as that about changing his or her party before.He added: “I’ve changed it, and now I hope that there is a Labour Party which people feel that they can vote for this time in a way which I accept wasn’t the case last time around.” 06:13 PM BSTStarmer praises Boris Johnson for ‘strong position’ on UkraineSir Keir Starmer has praised Boris Johnson for taking a “strong position” on Ukraine.He criticised the former prime minister for his behaviour on Partygate, but added: “To be fair on Ukraine, he took a strong position”.He added: “I was leader of the opposition, and I said, we will support the government. And so there’s been unity in parliament from the outbreak of that conflict and Russia aggression there.“And I thought that was important, Boris Johnson thought it was important, because I think we both took the view that the only winner, if there was a split in our politics here in the UK, would be Putin. He wanted to see division in other countries, and we didn’t allow him.”06:09 PM BSTSunak: I was right about Liz Truss so you can trust me on Sir Keir StarmerRishi Sunak has said that voters can trust what he says about Sir Keir Starmer because he was right to warn about Liz Truss’s plans for the economy.The Prime Minister ran against Ms Truss to become Tory leader and lost to her in the summer 2022 leadership election.Rishi Sunak told The Sun: “I spent a summer a couple of summers’ ago saying that what Liz Truss was proposing was wrong, and I was behind. And everyone said to me, ‘why are you bothering? Why are you still talking about this? No one wants to hear what you have to say.’ I kept talking about it every day of that because I believed in what I was saying.”He added: “I was right then when I warned about Liz Truss, and that’s why all of you can trust me now, when I also warn about the damage that Keir Starmer would do to our economy.”He told voters: “And I’m telling you again now, all seems a bit familiar. If Keir Starmer is your Prime Minister, the economy is going to suffer, and all of you are going to suffer. I don’t want to see that happen. That’s why I’m carrying on going every day in this election. I believe in what I’m saying, and I want to stop those tax rises.”05:54 PM BSTRishi Sunak apologises to voter whose father died after waiting months for cancer diagnosisRishi Sunak has apologised to a voter whose father died after waiting months for a cancer diagnosis.The woman told the Prime Minister that her family has been through “18 months of hell” and that they felt “let down”.Mr Sunak told her: “One of the ways we’re doing that is by rolling out things called community diagnostic centres. So we’ve done 160 and if we’re re-elected, we’ll do many more. And these are units in your local community where you can get all your checks, tests and scans done, and that way, get your diagnosis much quicker.“We’re hiring more oncologists, we’re using technology as well and new forms of testing to identify things, but fundamentally, what happened to you and your family isn’t acceptable. I can only apologise.

The only way to do that is to make sure that we make it clear that to come to our country illegally, you won’t get to stay. You’ll be removed.”05:41 PM BSTIt’s not right to say we haven’t made progress in 14 years, insists SunakRishi Sunak has insisted that it is “not right” to say that the UK has not made any progress in 14 years.The Prime Minister told The Sun: “I don’t think it’s right to say that we haven’t made progress in 14 years, I simply don’t believe that.”He added: “And if you look at 14 years, what the Conservatives have done, we’ve ensured that our school children in this country, in England, are not just the best readers in the United Kingdom, they’re best readers in the Western world.He added: “So yes, of course, not everything is perfect. Of course, we haven’t made as much progress as we would have liked to in some areas, but it’s just simply not right to say that the record of the last 14 years is one where we haven’t made progress.”05:37 PM BSTSunak: ‘We won’t hesitate to act’ on findings of our internal investigation into election betsRishi Sunak has said that he will not “hesitate to act on information or findings that come to light” in the internal party investigation into the allegations of betting on the election date.He told The Sun: “The Gambling Commission, who are investigating this, as well as the police, obviously, are independent of me, of Government.

We have a fully costed manifesto which can deliver tax cuts for people at every stage in their lives and that is largely funded by making sure that we can find some savings in the growth of the welfare budget, because it’s been growing at unsustainable levels since the pandemic.“We’ve set out a very clear plan to reform that, to support people into work, and in fact, the IFS acknowledge that last time around they said that that wasn’t possible, that it was actually delivered, and that’s something that the IFS themselves have said.“Labour in contrast don’t think you can save a single penny from the welfare bill, which is already where we’re spending more than on transport, schools, law enforcement. I don’t think that’s right. I want to deliver tax cuts for people and constraining the increase in the welfare budget is the right way to do that to support people in work.”12:49 PM BSTFarage: Labour would be ‘even more incompetent’ than the ToriesNigel Farage claimed a Labour government would be “even more incompetent than the Conservatives”.The Reform leader said: “I believe this Labour government will get into trouble very, very quickly.

It isn’t.“If there is one area where we need increased spending up to three per cent of GDP, it is defence and we need to do it as quickly as possible and this matters because without the Americans Nato is nothing and the Americans increasingly think that we are not a serious player.”12:27 PM BSTBoris Johnson the ‘worst PM of modern times’, claims FarageNigel Farage claimed Boris Johnson will go down in history as the “worst prime minister of modern times”.Mr Johnson took aim at Mr Farage last night on Twitter over his Ukraine comments (see the post below at 09.37).Mr Farage hit back at the former premier as he told a crowd in Maidstone this morning that Mr Johnson had “pretended to be a Conservative but he governed as a Green” .Mr Farage also unveiled a giant version of an “i” newspaper frontpage from 2016 with the headline “Boris blames EU for war in Ukraine” as the Reform leader defended the comments he made last week about Ukraine.Nigel Farage, the Reform leader, unveils a giant copy of an ""i"" newspaper frontpage during a campaign event in Maidstone - Chris J Ratcliffe /Reuters12:23 PM BSTFarage: ‘I would never, ever defend Putin’Nigel Farage said he would “never, ever defend” Vladimir Putin as he addressed the comments he made last week about Ukraine.Speaking in Maidstone, the Reform UK leader said: “I would never, ever defend Putin and think his behaviour in Ukraine and elsewhere has been reprehensible.“But if we are going to think towards a peace at sometime in the not too distant future perhaps it might be helpful to understand what went wrong in the first place.”12:20 PM BSTFarage jokes he won’t forget grandchild’s birthday on Brexit DayNigel Farage said that this whole general election campaign he had focused on talking about the “things that matter in life: family, community and country”.He said that yesterday he had celebrated the arrival of his first grandchild and he was unlikely to forget his birthday given that it fell on June 23 on the eighth anniversary of the Brexit vote.12:15 PM BSTFarage arrives in Maidstone for campaign speechNigel Farage has now arrived in Maidstone to deliver a campaign speech from on top of a double decker open top bus.The Reform UK leader will be speaking imminently.12:11 PM BSTSunak: Tories conducting internal investigation into betting scandalRishi Sunak said his party “will act” if the Conservatives’ own parallel inquiry into the general election betting scandal finds wrongdoing.The Primed Minister said: “The Gambling Commission is independent of Government – it’s independent of me.“I don’t have the details of their investigation, right?

The economy has flatlined for 14 years. That is exactly what we are wanting to change, that’s why we’ve set out our plans for growth in our manifesto.”11:25 AM BSTSir Ed Davey washes an ambulance during campaign visit in WimbledonSir Ed Davey donned overalls and a hi-vis jacket to clean an ambulance during a campaign visit in target seat Wimbledon in south-west London this morning.On his visit to Wimbledon ambulance station, he chatted to staff and stroked post-traumatic stress disorder assistance dog Teddy.The dog was wearing a harness stating “do not pet”.

The public want to see clear, robust action now.“The practical dilemma you face though is were individuals responding to the whirlwind of the rumour mill around Westminster at the time… about a pending election announcement or were they in the room when the decision was made.“If it was the latter the party can take immediate action.

And it is right that it has an investigation. It is an independent body.“I actually think, I saw that the leader of Labour’s campaign, Pat McFadden, wrote to try and put some undue influence on the Gambling Commission over the weekend and I think that is actually pretty concerning in itself, Labour trying to lean on yet another independent body like it leant on the Speaker of the House of Commons to not have a vote on Gaza.“I think you are beginning to see, people are beginning to see, what a Labour government would actually be like in the United Kingdom.”07:08 AM BSTLabour would create ‘more loopholes for predators’ with gender plans, claims BadenochKemi Badenoch claimed Labour’s gender plans would create “more loopholes for predators”.A Labour government would reportedly make it easier for people to legally change their gender.The Times reported that the party would remove the requirement for people to have to prove they have lived as another gender for a two year period before they can obtain a gender recognition certificate.Ms Badenoch, the minister for Women and Equalities, said: “These proposals unravel all the protections in the current system designed to protect women and girls.

I think when Liz Truss left in October 2022, they were 4, 5 per cent.”He added: “If you suffer a massive defeat, clearly the leader is very much responsible for that. What proportion? I don’t know.

Ken Jack via Getty ImagesLabour is on course for a 250-seat Commons majority, according to yet another poll predicting wipeout for the Tories.The Focaldata survey forecast that the Conservatives are set to lose a staggering 262 seats on July 4, leaving the party with just 110 MPs.Labour, meanwhile, will gain 250 to leave them on 450 seats.The Lib Dems will also see their number of MPs almost treble to 50, according to the poll, while the SNP would slump to just 16 MPs, down from the 48 they won in 2019.The poll was conducted using the so-called “MRP” method, which uses a bigger than normal sample.It also uses demographic data to calculate what the result would be on a seat-by-seat basis.Among the big-name Conservatives set to lose their seats, according to the poll, are Jeremy Hunt, Johnny Mercer and Grant Shapps, while Penny Mordaunt and James Cleverly’s seats are on a knife-edge.The Focaldata poll echoes a number of such surveys carried out by other pollsters since the campaign started, all of which pointed to huge Labour victories.However, Focaldata’s chief research officer, James Kanagasooriam, said the final result could be even worse for the Tories because many of the seats they are forecast to win are very close and could end up falling another way.Senior Tories, including Rishi Sunak, have effectively already conceded defeat by warning voters about the possibility of Labour winning a “super-majority”.The Conservatives’ campaign has become increasingly negative the closer we get to July 4, but nothing seems to be able to halt the inevitability of Keir Starmer becoming the next prime minister.Meanwhile, the ongoing Tory betting scandal appears to have scuppered any hopes the party had of a late fightback.Related...Tories On Course For Wipeout As New Opinion Polls Predict Huge Labour MajoritiesSunak Asked If Party Faces 'Existential' Threat After Reform Overtake Tories In New PollMore Misery For Rishi Sunak As Poll Predicts Tories Will Win Just 71 Seats At Election",Tories Heading For Electoral Wipeout As New Poll Predicts 250-Seat Labour Majority,14,3

Labour is predicted to secure 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.This projection would show the Tories plummeting from the 365 won by Boris Johnson in the 2019 election and give the party their lowest ever number of MPs.

Given the nature of these seat totals, it is natural to be slightly sceptical.""It adds: ""Not every MRP is the same. The statistical 'building blocks' used to model voter behaviour will vary from pollster to pollster, which will in turn lead to different vote shares and seat totals. All different pollsters will get different national vote share.""The MRP methodology, as described by YouGov, ""uses data at the constituency level to predict the outcomes of seats based on the concentration of various different types of voters who live there"".Stuart Wilks-Heeg, writing in The Conversation earlier this month, points out some of the other limitations of MRP polling: ""There are ... factors MRPs cannot take into account. Some constituency results will be influenced by locally specific issues that statistical models can’t capture. For example, adjustments cannot be made for who the candidates are in each constituency and whether any have a profile that could enhance, or detract from, their party’s chance of winning. Think Nigel Farage standing for Reform UK in Clacton.""And competing MRPs produce contrasting outcomes because each model uses specific assumptions and data. Different inputs produce different outputs. This election has seen more MRPs produced than ever before, and from various organisations. In the early hours of July 5, we’ll know which one came closest to getting the result correct.""What are the latest odds?As of 19 June, Oddschecker – a website which compares odds across different bookmakers – had Labour at 1/41 to win the most seats. To put that in context, this is seen as so likely that a £10 bet would return just £10.24.The Conservatives are 40/1 to win the most seats, a scenario seen as so unlikely that a £10 punt would return £410.What went wrong for the Tories?YouGov's voting intention tracker between January 2020 and June 2024. (YouGov)So, why have the polls changed so dramatically? It's worth looking back on an extremely eventful four-and-a-half years in UK politics.According to YouGov's voting intention tracker (see chart, above), Tory support peaked at 53%, with Labour on 32%, in April 2020, months after the party's stunning success in the 2019 general election and Boris Johnson's pledge to “get Brexit done”. That month also saw Starmer take over as Labour leader from Jeremy Corbyn.This was also amid a spirit of national unity following the onset of the COVID pandemic which nearly killed Johnson himself. The then-PM had been released from hospital five days before this particular survey was taken.Boris Johnson delivers his final speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street in September 2022. (AFP via Getty Images)Over the rest of the year, there was a downturn in support amid chaos over COVID rules, with the Tories falling as low as 35% in November 2020, compared to Labour on 40%.However, the UK’s successful COVID vaccination programme provided a pathway out of lockdown and with it, improved poll ratings. Tory support peaked at 41% in June 2021, with Labour at 30%.In October that year, there was a sense Johnson was untouchable. At the Tory party conference, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg remarked how the PM was ""in total command of his party, and politically dominant in the country"".But this fell apart quickly with the Partygate scandal, which emerged in November that year. Time and again, reports emerged of government and Tory staff – including Johnson – having taken part in lockdown-era social gatherings when their own COVID rules had prohibited them.By January 2022, Tory support had plummeted to 28%, with Labour on 38%. Johnson struggled on, but never recovered and a wave of ministerial resignations forced him to resign in July that year.The UK had three separate prime ministers – Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak – between 6 September and 24 October, 2022. (Getty Images)His successor, Liz Truss, then embarked on arguably the most disastrous prime ministerial reign in history, characterised by the catastrophic ""mini-budget"", containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, which prompted an economic crisis. Like Johnson, she lost the confidence of Tory MPs – and voters – and had to resign.Her 49-day spell as PM was the shortest in history, with Tory support plummeting to 19% (with Labour on 56%) the day after she announced her resignation in October 2022.Rishi Sunak, who had lost to Truss in the previous month's Tory leadership election, took over. However, as the above YouGov chart indicates, he has failed to cut through with voters. Tory support was at 23% two days after he assumed office, with the most recent survey, carried out on Thursday, showing support is now lower than under Truss at 18%.In short, the polls and odds, not to mention other factors such as notable by-election victories for Starmer's Labour, are pointing to a Labour government next month.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

357,"Two thirds of voters think Tory candidates betting on the date of the general election is unacceptable, an opinion poll has found.The outrage cuts across political party lines, with broadly the same proportion of Tory, Labour, Liberal Democrat and Reform voters all expressing disapproval over the scandal.The finding in the latest polling by Savanta for The Telegraph chimes with claims from Labour figures that the Tory betting scandal is cutting through with voters.On Tuesday, Rishi Sunak finally suspended two Tory candidates, Craig Williams and Laura Saunders.Both are reportedly being looked into by the Gambling Commission for election bets.Mr Williams, the prime minister’s parliamentary private secretary, admitted 13 days ago to having a “flutter” on the election and 12 days ago accepted it had been a “huge error of judgement”.Mr Sunak’s action comes after an increasing number of Tory candidates were going public calling for suspensions and expressing fury at the behaviour alleged to have taken place.Some 2,300 voters across the UK were surveyed by Savanta from June 21-24 as part of regular election polling for this newspaper.One question asked: “Thinking about Conservative candidates who have placed bets on the date of the general election, which of the following statements best describes your view?”Some 67 per cent of all respondents agreed with the statement “it was unacceptable”. That was more than three times the 19 per cent who agreed “it was acceptable”. The rest selected “don’t know”.Mr Sunak's action comes after an increasing number of Tory candidates were going public calling for suspensions - HENRY NICHOLLS/AFPOften polling results show stark differences depending on which political party people plan to vote for, but in this case there was little difference in responses.The proportions who thought it was unacceptable was 67 per cent for Tory voters, 71 per cent for Labour voters, 77 per cent for Lib Dem voters and 71 per cent for Reform voters.So far, four Tory figures have been named in reports as being interviewed by the Gambling Commission over bets on the date of the general election.Mr Sunak surprised many in Westminster when he announced the election for July 4, rather than for the autumn.Betting data shows a surge of punts on a July election were placed just before it was announced on May 22.A close protection officer to Mr Sunak has also been arrested over election betting.The latest Telegraph-Savanta polling has Labour still with a vast lead, as the election campaign approaches its final week.Labour were on 42 per cent of the vote, followed by the Tories on 21 per cent. That 21-point lead is roughly in line with the average from other pollsters.The Tories gained two points, with Reform down two to 14 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 10 per cent.Some of those caught up in the betting scandal have put out public comments since reports broke that they were being looked into by the Gambling Commission.When first named by The Guardian, Mr Williams said: “I’ve been contacted by a journalist about Gambling Commission inquiries into one of my accounts and thought it best to be totally transparent.“I put a flutter on the general election some weeks ago. This has resulted in some routine inquiries and I confirm I will fully co-operate with these.“I don’t want it to be a distraction from the campaign, I should have thought how it looks.”A solicitor for Ms Saunders, the Tory candidate for Bristol North West, said that she was co-operating with the inquiry.On Tuesday, a Conservative Party spokesman said: “As a result of ongoing internal enquiries, we have concluded that we can no longer support Craig Williams or Laura Saunders as parliamentary candidates at the forthcoming general election.“We have checked with the Gambling Commission that this decision does not compromise the investigation that they are conducting, which is rightly independent and ongoing.”A spokesman for the Gambling Commission has previously said the body is “investigating the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election”.He added: “We are not confirming or denying the identity of any individuals involved in this investigation.”","Tory candidates betting on election date is unacceptable, say two thirds of voters",15,11
354,"Throughout the last Parliament, a number of both Labour and Conservative MPs sought to pressure the Government into banning so-called ‘conversion therapy’.On the face of it, this may seem a noble aim. Some of the ‘therapies’ employed in the past to attempt to change a person’s sexual orientation were utterly abhorrent and included the use of electric shock treatment and rape. But of course – mercifully – these practices are now very much illegal, and the Government Equalities Office found no evidence that they are taking place today in the UK. Non-violent but coercive ‘practices’ are also illegal, and we have a whole host of legislation that covers harassment, sexual abuse, domestic abuse and homophobic speech and discrimination.Yet for many campaigners, this isn’t enough and they have repeatedly called not only for a ban on attempts to alter someone’s sexuality, but for this ban to include a prohibition on changing someone’s ‘gender identity’. And this is where the task of drafting effective legislation moves from the ‘difficult’ to the ‘impossible’ pile. Because, in law or in fact, there is no objectively verifiable definition or test of ‘gender identity’.This is why two attempts to bring Private Members Bills this year – one in the Commons and one in the Lords – have both failed. In speech after speech, MPs and Peers pointed out the Bills’ flaws, exposing the weaknesses of any legislation that would prevent parents, teachers and therapists from asking sensible questions and providing wise guidance to children who are questioning their gender. Both of these discredited laws could have resulted in parents, teachers and clinicians being criminalised if they deliberately set out to dissuade a child from ‘changing sex’.The sad truth is that, over the last 15 years, more and more children have been exposed to gender ideology, which is now rampant in school, institutions and social media across the Western world. The Tavistock scandal and the Cass Review exposed just how pernicious and dangerous this ideology is, especially to vulnerable children such as those with autism or who have experienced trauma. Countless thousands of children treated at NHS gender clinics were put on a path of irreversible physical and biological change – including the loss of healthy body parts, infertility, sexual dysfunction and lifelong health problems. This scandal happened because too many adults failed to question the idea that a child can or should ‘change sex’. Instead of giving these children wise and evidence-based counsel, clinicians – and some activist charities and even teachers – accepted that feelings of gender dysphoria in children as young as ten or eleven should be celebrated and treated as a real and irrefutable sign that they had been ‘born in the wrong body.’Yet rather than considering how to avoid a repeat of this tragedy the Labour Party’s response is to commit to bringing in a ‘trans inclusive’ conversion therapy ban that would make it even harder for responsible adults to protect children from the harms of gender ideology. Seemingly dismissive – or perhaps unaware – of the very serious unintended consequences for child protection and free speech that such a ban would invoke, Keir Starmer believes he can succeed where the Government and Parliament have failed.We understand that Labour’s ban would include ‘safeguards’ similar to those included in former Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle’s unsuccessful Private Members Bill. But these ‘safeguards’ were worthless, containing a multitude of contradictions, circular definitions and a failure precisely to define key terms such as ‘transgender’. Incomprehensibly, under Russell-Moyle’s Bill, a parent would have been ‘protected’ from prosecution under the conversion practices legislation, except if they were guilty of a conversion practice. As we have seen from cases brought under the Equality Act, it would take just one successful prosecution to induce a chilling effect on anyone who seeks to protect children.Conservatives who stand up to such extreme attempts to undermine society are frequently accused of stoking a culture war. But the truth is that it is those on the Left who are waging a full-on war on our culture, a culture which – until now at least – upholds the rights of parents to protect and guide their children as they see fit. The fact that Keir Starmer is willing to risk criminalising responsible parents tells us all we need to know about his ‘changed’ Labour Party.",Starmer wants to make good parenting illegal,15,11
211,"Rishi Sunak has withdrawn the Conservative Party’s support for the Tory candidates tied up in the general election betting scandal.Two weeks after the scandal first emerged, the Conservatives have dropped Craig Williams and Laura Saunders, both of whom linked to the prime minister’s inner circle and were under investigation by the Gambling Commission.But even a Conservative former cabinet minister asked “why did it take so long”.The commission is looking into allegations of bets placed on the date of the general election, ahead of the announcement by Rishi Sunak that it would take place on 4 July.Mr Williams, the candidate for Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr, and Mr Sunak’s parliamentary private secretary, appeared to admit betting on the election date just days before Mr Sunak announced it, saying he made a “huge error of judgement”.Click here for our live coverage of the general election campaign.Ms Saunders is running in Bristol North West and has worked for the party since 2015. She is married to Tony Lee, the Conservative Party’s director of campaigns, who is also being probed by the gambling watchdog.Craig Williams served as the Prime Minister’s parliamentary private secretary (UK Parliament/PA) (PA Media)Because nominations have closed, Mr Williams - who is standing in Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr - and Ms Saunders will both still be on the ballot paper.But a Conservative Party spokesman said: “As a result of ongoing internal enquiries, we have concluded that we can no longer support Craig Williams or Laura Saunders as Parliamentary Candidates at the forthcoming General Election.“We have checked with the Gambling Commission that this decision does not compromise the investigation that they are conducting, which is rightly independent and ongoing.”Shortly afterwards, a Conservative former cabinet minister, Lord Frost, tweeted “why did it take so long”.The prime minister had faced weeks of pressure to suspend those involved in the betting scandal, with Northern Ireland minister Steve Baker on Monday becoming the latest senior Tory to call for action to be taken.Laura Saunders and her husband Tony Lee are both under investigation by the Gambling Commission (Supplied)The Northern Ireland minister told ITV: “I would call them up and ask them, ‘Did you do it?’ And if they did it, then they are suspended.“But the Prime Minister would have to answer why he hasn’t done it, I haven’t got inside information on why the prime minister hasn’t done it.”He joined senior Tories including Tobias Ellwood in calling for the suspension of the four Tories alleged to have placed bets on the election date.Others tied to the Gambling Commission probe include the party’s chief data officer Nick Mason, who has taken a leave of absense from Tory HQ. A close protection officer for the prime minister was also suspended by the Metropolitan Police and is being investigated.Responding to the suspensions, Sir Keir Starmer told reporters: “Why didn’t that happen a week ago?”And shadow paymaster general Jonathan Ashworth said: “It is yet another example of Rishi Sunak’s staggeringly weak leadership that it has taken him nearly two weeks to see what was obvious to everyone else.Rishi Sunak had come under significant pressure to suspend the candidates (Getty Images)“The Conservatives who sought to line their own pockets by betting on the election date are not fit to be candidates for parliament.”And Mr Ashworth called on the prime minister to “come clean” about how many Conservative figures are implicated in the scandal and who they are.He added: “Just as with Partygate and the PPE scandal, the Conservatives believe it is one rule for them, another for everyone else.”The Gambling Commission has compiled a list of everyone who put a bet on a July general election after 1 May and is now “combing through the data and picking off people from that”, an industry source told The Independent.Mr Williams placed a £100 bet with 5-1 odds, meaning he would have won £500, but he would not have received the payout until after the contest. His suspension is a major blow for the party in Wales, as the Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr seat he was contesting is the only Welsh seat projected as a Tory win in a major seat-level YouGov poll last week.",Rishi Sunak suspends candidates linked to election betting scandal,15,9
229,"Rishi Sunak’s Facebook page has not put a single paid advert out since the end of May, in contrast to those of Sir Keir Starmer and Nigel Farage.No new campaigns have appeared in the Prime Minister’s name on the social media giant since a two-minute montage promoted in the week after he called the general election.The film, which showed Mr Sunak touring the country and making his rain-soaked Downing Street speech, was seen by more than one million Facebook users at a cost of between £10,000 and £15,000.It stopped appearing on newsfeeds on May 30 and there have been no such clips since, while the Tory leader’s popularity has continued to slide amid a campaign hit by a number of political mis-steps.Scarlett Maguire of JL Partners, the polling firm, said: “Initially, the Conservatives wanted to run a presidential campaign because they were quite confident that Keir Starmer is a weak candidate, and in some senses the data justified this.“Before the campaign got underway, the public were not sold on Keir Starmer – he underperformed his party and people in focus groups had a lot of hesitations about him. However, I think what they failed to take into account is just how unpopular Rishi is with the public.“Even before he called the general election he was the most unpopular prime minister by historic comparisons this far into his term and this close to an election. Keir Starmer has actually slightly increased his lead on crucial questions like who would make the best prime minister.“People seem to be warming up to him a little bit as it becomes more likely he’ll become prime minister, whereas the two things that have really cut through from the Conservative campaign side have been D-Day and gamble-gate – two things that have only undermined Rishi Sunak’s standing with the public.”A YouGov poll this week found Mr Sunak’s net approval rating has fallen to a historic low – meaning he is now more unpopular than Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn at their nadirs.Sir Keir’s facebook page spent £36,077 on 1,070 different sponsored posts reaching people in the past seven days, while Mr Farage’s spent £5,619 across 18 adverts.Posts that the Labour leader has promoted include the party’s most recent election broadcast, in which he takes a walk in the Lake District with Gary Neville, pundit and former England defender.Mr Farage’s posts group Sir Keir and Mr Sunak together, accusing them both of offering “the highest taxes in 70 years” and “one migrant every minute” in contrast to Reform’s pledges to freeze non-essential immigration and raise the income tax threshold to £20,000 from its current rate of £12,500.Analysis of Facebook’s ad library shows Conservative adverts in recent weeks have focused heavily on attacking Sir Keir and his party’s past record on tax and pensions, rather than promoting Mr Sunak or members of his Cabinet.By contrast, sponsored Labour videos include a host of frontbench figures. As well as Sir Keir featuring prominently, Angela Rayner, his deputy, and Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, are seen delivering bespoke messages to voters about party policies.Adverts targeting voters in London also make use of Sadiq Khan, the Labour Mayor of London, who was re-elected to a historic third term in City Hall last month.Mr Khan said in his video that voting Labour would “break down barriers to opportunity” and resolve the cost-of-living crisis.Appearing to acknowledge voters deserting the party over issues like the Israel-Hamas conflict, which was evidenced by the recent local elections, he added: “If you vote for any other candidate or party in this election, then you could end up with a Conservative MP and a Conservative government. Don’t risk it, vote Labour.”Meanwhile, three different Tory posts mock Sir Keir up as Lord Kitchener – who was at the centre of Britain’s First World War recruitment drive in 1914 – alongside the caption “Starmer needs you to vote Reform!”It echoes a now-familiar Tory argument that a vote for Mr Farage’s insurgent party will only increase the size of a Labour majority.The Tories have more than quadrupled their spending on older voters as they appeal to the public over their record on pensions. In the past week, six per cent of the party’s Facebook spend was allocated solely towards reaching over-65s, up from 1.3 per cent across the last 30 days.The advert in question reads: “Remember when Labour increased the state pension by only 75p? Don’t risk your pension with Labour. Only the Conservatives will protect it.”The Conservatives and Reform have outspent Labour in their Facebook advertising, with the social media site playing host to more older voters than Instagram or TikTok.The Conservative Party was contacted for comment.",Rishi Sunak’s Facebook page has not put a single new ad out since May,15,11
87,"JK Rowling has agreed to meet Labour on the condition that Angela Rayner apologises for endorsing a charter that described two organisations, Woman’s Place and the LGB Alliance, as “hate groups”.At the weekend, the Harry Potter author claimed that Labour had “abandoned” women and she would “struggle to support” Sir Keir Starmer’s party at the general election because of its transgender stance.Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, responded by offering her a meeting to provide “assurances” over the protection of women-only spaces.Responding to Ms Reeves’ remarks, Ms Rowling said: “I’ll be happy to meet after Keep Prisons Single Sex, Lesbian Labour, Women’s Rights Network, Woman’s Place and the LGB Alliance have been given in-person meetings with the Labour leadership.“I’d also like to know whether Angela Rayner still considers the last two organisations hate groups – asking on behalf of female survivors of domestic violence and gay people who don’t subscribe to gender identity ideology.”‘Really happy to talk to JK Rowling’When Ms Rayner stood to become Labour’s deputy leader in 2020, she backed a charter calling Woman’s Place UK, which campaigns for women-only rape refuges, and the LGB Alliance, set up in response to Stonewall’s stance on trans issues, “trans-exclusionist hate groups”.Ms Rayner’s spokesman refused to apologise for her comments in April after the publication of the Cass Review into the treatment of children with gender issues.The report concluded that much of the evidence for the use of medicine including puberty blockers was “shaky” and that such drugs should be treated with extreme caution.The fresh row involving Rowling comes despite Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, strengthening his position on transgender issues to agree with Sir Tony Blair that a woman has a vagina and a man has a penis.Sir Keir said in 2021 it was “not right” for Rosie Duffield, a Labour MP who has stressed the importance of biological sex, to say that only women have a cervix.In an article for The Times on Saturday, Rowling said she had a “poor opinion” of Sir Keir’s character, claiming he was “dismissive and often offensive” in respect of women’s concerns about their sex-based rights.On Monday, Ms Reeves said that she would be “really happy to talk to JK Rowling” to give the author “assurances” about the Equality Act.“For me, those protections whether it is about prisons, refuges, changing spaces, that is really important to me, it is really important to the Labour Party that those single sex spaces based on biological sex are protected,” said the shadow chancellor. “And nothing in our plans goes contrary to that, nothing at all.”‘Everyday injustices and indignities’Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, told Times Radio he had been left “pretty depressed” by Ms Rowling’s comments, saying transgender women had been “beaten up by headlines”, while gender-critical campaigners felt “silenced”.“When women like JK Rowling do speak up, I think it’s important we engage seriously with the arguments that she’s making, with the concerns that she has,” he said.“And also we listen to what trans people are saying about the everyday injustices and indignities that they’re experiencing too, whether that’s hate crime or poor provision in public services.”In its election manifesto, Labour has committed to making it easier for people to legally change gender, which has prompted Tory warnings about loopholes for sexual predators.Sir Keir’s party would overhaul the existing process, which it claims is outdated, to replace the need to provide two years of proof before changing gender, with a cooling off period of the same timeframe.Labour would also scrap a panel of doctors and lawyers that currently approves gender-recognition certificates, instead allowing one specialist doctor to sign off applications.","JK Rowling agrees to meet Labour, but sets conditions over labelling of ‘hate groups’",15,11

The leaders did not go head to head and instead were given 30-minute slots to answer audience questions.The debate announcements were confirmed after the Tories had pressed Sir Keir to take part in a record six debates during the six-week election countdown.Conservative sources had dubbed the opposition leader “the knight that won’t fight” and “Sir Fear Starmer” after he failed to sign up to their weekly debate demand.Labour headquarters indicated instead that their leader would take part in two head-to-head debates against Mr Sunak, matching what Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn did ahead of the 2019 election.What channels are the debates on?The BBC, ITV and Sky News have hosted debates in an array of formats in the race to the general election.All broadcasts from the BBC are available on BBC1, BBC News and are live on the corporation’s streaming platforms BBC Iplayer.The BBC also confirmed they will air several debates on local radio.ITV will show their programmes on their main channel ITV1, as well as their steaming service ITVX.

218,"Rishi Sunak looks like Sir John Major in the run-up to the 1997 general election when “everyone knew what the result would be”, Kwasi Kwarteng has suggested.Mr Kwarteng, a former chancellor, said this year’s election campaign reminded him of the period before Sir Tony Blair’s New Labour landslide.The senior Tory – who is not standing at the election – said there “could still be surprises” ahead of polling day on July 4, but believed that “you can see where the thing is going”.Mr Kwarteng also admitted that he felt “partially responsible” for the Conservative Party’s dire position in the polls, but said Mr Sunak must take most of the blame.It was suggested to him during an interview on GB News that the Prime Minister was campaigning every day despite knowing he was not going to win.He replied: “I think it is very difficult for him, for any prime minister. The only thing I can remember which is similar was 1997, when you kind of knew that Labour would get in. I think John Major and the Cabinet, they looked pretty tired and they were going out to campaign and everyone knew what the result would be.“It feels a bit like that this year. There could still be surprises – we don’t know. But at the moment, when you have got Cabinet ministers warning about Labour ‘super majorities’, I think Jeremy Hunt and Grant Shapps have mentioned that, you can see where the thing is going.”The former chancellor claimed Mr Sunak and others in the Tory party also needed to shoulder the blame for the Conservatives being so far behind Labour.He said the Prime Minister was to blame for leaving the D-Day ceremony early and for not having dealt with the threat of Reform UK, and claimed the decision to call an election early, as well as the betting scandal, were also contributing to the party’s woes.Two MPs and two party staffers are under investigation for allegedly placing bets on a July election before it was announced, using insider knowledge.Mr Kwarteng delivered Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-Budget in September 2022, which spooked the markets by making unfunded tax cuts. It sparked a rise in interest rates that ultimately led to a chaotic end of her premiership the following month.The Tories’ opinion poll ratings also tanked during this time and, asked whether he felt responsible for the Tories’ current position, he told GB News: “I feel partially responsible – but I don’t feel responsible for leaving D-Day early, I don’t feel responsible for the Reform party, which was on four per cent in October 2022, being on nearly 20 per cent now.“I don’t feel responsible for the election betting scandal, nor do I feel responsible for the fact that this election has happened way before anyone was expecting it.”","Sunak looks like Major in run-up to 1997 Labour landslide, suggests Kwarteng",15,11
197,"Rishi Sunak has insisted that anyone in the Conservative Party who is found to have broken betting laws should be “booted out” and “face the full consequences of the law”.During a live Q&A with The Sun readers, hosted by Harry Cole on Monday night, the Prime Minister was grilled on his handling of the election date betting scandal that has rocked the Tory party’s election campaign while Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer was asked how he could be trusted after he was “happy to lie to us” about Jeremy Corbyn.Mr Sunak reiterated that the party was conducting an internal investigation alongside the Gambling Commission probe.The Prime Minister said: “I’m incredibly angry about this and the right thing to do...is to get to the bottom of what happened, to investigate things thoroughly.“Now we have to do that separately to the Gambling Commission, who don’t report to me. I don’t have the details of their investigation. We have to do that sensitively and carefully so that we don’t compromise the integrity of a police and other investigations.“But let me be clear, if we come across findings or information that warrants it, we will not hesitate to act, I have been crystal clear that I will hold people to account, whoever they are.”Mr Sunak added that anyone who has broken rules should be “booted out of the Conservative Party” and “should face the full consequences of the law”.Rishi Sunak shake hands with members of the audience after making a speech at an event at Petyt Hall (Stefan Rousseau/PA Wire)But he said it is “proper” to wait for the outcome of multiple investigations before taking action.The Gambling Commission, the police and the Conservative Party are all understood to be looking into claims that several figures with links to the Tories or Number 10 placed bets on the date of the General Election shortly before Mr Sunak announced his plans last month.Those include Mr Sunak’s former parliamentary aide Craig Williams, who has already admitted to having “a flutter” on the election date in what he told the BBC was a “huge error of judgment”.The party’s chief data officer, Nick Mason, and campaigning director, Tony Lee, have both taken leaves of absence after being implicated in the scandal, while Mr Lee’s wife, Tory candidate Laura Saunders, is also under investigation by the Gambling Commission.Mr Sunak was also grilled on immigration, housing and NHS wait times during the Q&A.He claimed migrants are “queuing up in Calais” waiting for a Labour government so they can come to the UK.He also defended his record on cutting down net migration, claiming that the number of visas accepted by the Home Office this year had dropped by 30 per cent.Mr Sunak added: “If you look at the forecast, independent forecasts, not mine, we’re forecast to halve net migration in 12 months because of the measures that I’ve already taken, by the way the Labour Party opposed all of those, and I want to go further.”To wrap up, an animated Mr Sunak said: “I’m not going to pretend we got everything right. I know the last few years have been particualry frustrating.“But I’m not going to sit here and say the last 14 years hasn’t made the country a better place.”He added: “If you want taxes cut... and action on legal migration and stopping the boats... I’m the only person who is going to deliver that for you.”Meanwhile an audience member said that when Sir Keir backed Mr Corbyn in 2019 and now justified it by saying he did not believe the then-Labour leader would win that election, “that means you’re happy to lie to us – how do we know you’re not lying now?”Sir Keir listed his track record of transforming the Northern Ireland police service and the Crown Prosecution Service in response.“What I’m asking for now is the opportunity to pick the country up, which is as broken as my party was in 2019, and change it for the better,” the Labour leader said.Sir Keir Starmer meeting Labour supporters during a visit to Northampton Town Football Club (Jacob King/PA Wire)Sir Keir also claimed that the backlog of asylum claims would double by the end of the year to 100,000 if the Conservatives are re-elected.“There are 50,000 people not being processed, if we carry on with Rishi Sunak as prime minister it will get to 100k by the end of the year,” the Labour leader said.Sir Keir vowed to crack down on people smuggling gangs with a border security command with counter terrorism powers.“I know how it’s done and I think it can be done again,” he said.He claimed the number of people being deported from the UK has dropped by 44 per cent under the current Government.He said if Labour came into power, he would put staff back in the Home Office returns unit and return people “back to countries where they came from”.He added that Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda plan was an “expensive gimmick”.",Betting rule-breakers 'should be booted out of Tory party' Sunak vows as Starmer grilled on Corbyn,15,0

Stefan Rousseau - PA Images via Getty ImagesKeir Starmer has admitted his children are “worried” about what the impact will be on their lives of him becoming prime minister.The Labour leader, who has a 13-year-old daughter and a 16-year-old son, said he and his wife Victoria “will fiercely protect their privacy” if he makes it to No.10.Every opinion is predicting that Starmer is set to become PM with a massive Commons majority as the Tory election campaign goes from bad to worse.On ITV’s This Morning, presenter Ben Shephard asked him how his children feel about the prospect of their dad becoming prime minister.“How do they feel about the fact that their life could significantly change?” he said.Starmer replied: “We’ve got to get it over the line, but they’re worried, if I’m honest.“They are worried about it because, and I think every parent will understand this, if you’re a teenage child, you don’t want things to change. You’ve got things set up at home exactly as you want them, you’ve got your friends, you’ve got your routines and you’ve got your first little bits of independence. What are you doing after school, it may not be a big thing but you can do what you want with your friends after school.“All of that, I can see deep down they’re worried this could change, which is why we will fiercely protect their privacy and ensure that they are able to continue doing that.”He added: “I wouldn’t be being straight with you if I didn’t say I’m worried about the impact and inside I think they are.”The Labour leader also revealed that his family will move from their home in North London to Downing Street if he wins the election.Related...'Why Are You Behind Farage On This?': Keir Starmer Criticised Over Refusal To Scrap Two Child Cap‘There Are Bigger Things To Come’: How Keir Starmer Plans To Make Life Better From Day One Of A Labour Government'We Want To Be A Party Of Power': Keir Starmer Slaps Down Heckler At Labour Manifesto Launch",Keir Starmer Says His Teenage Children Are 'Worried' About Him Becoming Prime Minister,15,3
243,"Shoplifting has become an “epidemic” in London, the Liberal Democrats warned on Tuesday as it was revealed offences had increased almost 80 per cent in three years.Less than one in five reports of the crime were attended by an officer last year, shocking Met Police data shows.In 2021 there were 30,109 cases of shoplifting reported to the force. This rose to a staggering 54,161 cases in 2023.Shopkeepers have warned how their profits are being hit by people targeting their stores to steal goods. Last year 35,000 reports received no visit from a police officer, data obtained in a Freedom of Information request from the Liberal Democrats shows.The party said it would invest an extra £170 million into frontline policing over the course of the next Parliament - a move paid for by savings from abolishing Police and Crime Commissioners.Liberal Democrat candidate for Carshalton and Wallington, Bobby Dean said: “The Conservatives have sat on their hands while shopkeepers across London are left to face a growing shoplifting epidemic.”He stressed that the capital needed more “bobbies back on the beat” with the resources to properly investigate all crimes.“That is why the Liberal Democrats are calling for an extra £170m to be invested in frontline policing across the country. Only that way we can get back to proper community policing to help bring criminals to justice,” he added.Carshalton and Wallington is one of three Lib-Dem target seats in south west London, alongside Wimbledon, and Sutton and Cheam.The Evening Standard has drawn up an interactive map of the key contests in the capital, as well as all the other constituencies.The Tories are pledging to recruit 8,000 more full-time, fully warranted police officers to “ensure a new police officer for every neighbourhood”, as well as making more use of facial recognition technology to catch law breakers.Labour has promised to “restore neighbourhood policing with thousands of extra officers” who would be “equipped with the powers they need”.The number of shoplifting offences recorded by police in England and Wales has risen to the highest level in 20 years.A total of 430,104 offences were logged by forces last year, up more than a third (37 per cent) on the 315,040 recorded in the previous 12 months to December 2022.","Shoplifting 'epidemic' in London as offences soar almost 80% in three years, warn Liberal Democrats",15,0
96,"John Oliver’s on-air tirade about the general election will be available to watch in the UK, Sky has confirmed amid concerns from British viewers.No political party was spared in the latest episode of Oliver’s late-night talk show, which sees the Birmingham-born comedian monologue about the forthcoming general election. Moments from the segment have been praised as “hilarious” by fans after going viral on social media.When Sky Comedy did not broadcast the latest episode of HBO’s Last Week Tonight in its usual Monday night slot yesterday (24 June), British viewers became worried that the instalment would not be made available to watch due to broadcaster regulations.Strict impartiality rules prevented Sky from airing the episode on TV, but fans will be relieved to hear that the episode will be available to stream online later on Tuesday (25 June).The episode will be available in full, with Oliver’s 30-minute segment on the election intact, a Sky source told Deadline.The reason for this is because video-on-demand content is not as tightly regulated as TV in the UK.Although the episode sees Oliver mock parties across the political spectrum, he reserves particular ire for Rishi Sunak’s Conservative party as he tells viewers that the 4 July election is an opportunity to tell the “c***s, f***pigs and weirdos” to “f*** off into the sun”.“If we do this, 4 July will no longer be known as just an American holiday,” he said.(HBO)Referring to the last 14 years of Tory rule, the 47-year-old quipped: “If a wild badger broke into your home and f***ed everything up for 14 years straight, tearing absolutely everything apart, you would think, ‘OK, you know what, we’ll worry about redecorating choices later. Right now, that badger needs to f***ing go.’”Elsewhere, he took a swipe at Labour leader Keir Starmer, stating: “Fun fact about Keir, there aren’t any”.(HBO / Sky / PA)",John Oliver’s ‘hilarious’ general election tirade will stream in the UK despite censorship fears,15,9
132,"Mortgage RatesThree of the UK’s biggest lenders have cut their fixed mortgage rates in the past week in anticipation of interest rate cuts after the election.HSBC has followed Barclays and NatWest to become the latest lender to bring down home loan costs, and more are expected to follow.The bank will cut rates across its residential and buy-to-let loans from Wednesday 26 June.On Monday, Barclays announced rate cuts of up to 0.31 percentage points for home buyers.Last week, the Bank of England held its Bank Rate at 5.25pc for the seventh time despite inflation falling to its target of 2pc in May.The drop has raised hopes that the central bank will make its first cut as early as August and bring down the cost of borrowing, with some analysts suggesting the Bank was unlikely to drop its rate during an election period.ADVERTISEMENTJeremy Batstone-Carr, european strategist at Raymond James Investment Services said: “The general election precludes the Bank from making moves that could signify political favour.  Once the new Parliament is seated and a new budget is delivered, the trajectory for monetary policy will be made clearer.“That being said, it is clear that a rate cut is on the horizon and, assuming inflationary pressures remain eased, it is likely there may be more than one.”The Bank Rate has sat at its current level, a 16-year high, since autumn last year in an ongoing bid to tackle inflation that peaked at 11.1pc in October 2022.Nicholas Mendes of broker John Charcol said: “We can anticipate that lenders will escalate their strategies significantly over the next few weeks.“Following last week’s Monetary Policy Committee decision and with important wage data and general election results on the horizon, markets are likely to anticipate further reductions in bank rates.”Mendes added that with the five-year SONIA swap rate – the main pricing mechanism for five year fixed rate mortgages – at 3.82pc there is space for lenders to lower rates from their current levels.Story continuesThe average interest for a five-year fixed rate mortgage is currently 5.53pc, according to analyst Moneyfacts.It is hoped that news of rate cuts will reinvigorate the property market that has remained sluggish as homeowners and buyers have waited for a fall in loan costs.Managing director of mortgage broker Anderson Harris, Adrian Anderson said: “The property market is historically quieter during the summer months hence lower mortgage rates may help activity in the market and help give buyers some confidence.“There is a lot of pent up demand from buyers ‘waiting to see what happens to mortgage rates’.”There were 5.9 new prospective buyers for every property for sale in May, according to estate agency Knight Frank.  Buyers have only faced less competition once during the last five years, two months after the mini-Budget in December 2022.However, Chris Sykes of Private Finance warns that while cuts may give “some zest” to the summer market, they aren’t significant.“In honesty the drops are not major and we are basically returning to similar rates as to what we had 6-10 weeks ago, so this isn’t at all groundbreaking from a finance point of view. It could keep people waiting and hoping for further rate improvements, that remains to be seen,” he said.Liam O’Hara, head of mortgages at lender First Direct added “The market has a tendency to move quickly and pricing is influenced by a complex range of factors, which means it’s difficult to predict the trajectory of rates in the next few months.“There is no set timeline on rates coming down further so mortgage holders may want to consider making the most of deals while they’re available. Some lenders do allow the transfer of booking fees within a certain period if rates come down more, so it’s also worth checking with your mortgage provider if that’s an option.”",Three big banks slash mortgage rates ahead of election,15,11
298,"The Conservative party has finally dropped the two candidates who are under investigation for allegedly placing suspicious bets about the date of the election, after previously standing by them.In a major U-turn, the party said it could no longer support the candidacy of Craig Williams, a parliamentary private secretary to Rishi Sunak standing in Montgomeryshire and Glyndŵr, and Laura Saunders, the candidate for Bristol North West. Saunders is married to the Conservatives’ head of campaigning, Tony Lee, who has taken a leave of absence.The move means their campaigns will no longer be supported and they would not have the Conservative whip if they won the seats. However, the pair are believed not to have had their membership of the party suspended while the Gambling Commission inquiry is continuing.A party spokesperson said: “As a result of ongoing internal inquiries, we have concluded that we can no longer support Craig Williams or Laura Saunders as parliamentary candidates at the forthcoming general election. We have checked with the Gambling Commission that this decision does not compromise the investigation that they are conducting, which is rightly independent and ongoing.”The decision to drop Williams and Saunders is Sunak’s latest effort to draw a line under the gambling scandal that has dogged his election campaign for two weeks.Last week, it was revealed that one of the prime minister’s personal Metropolitan police protection officers had been arrested and questioned over alleged bets on the timing of the general election, using information gained from their role.The information that led to that officer’s arrest for misconduct in public office, came from a Gambling Commission inquiry into the suspicious activity around the placing of bets on the general election date.The Met police has been passed new information by the Gambling Commission suggesting there may be other police officers who placed suspicious bets on the date of the poll.So far, four politicians and officials in the Conservative party are alleged to have been involved in the placing the bets and are being investigated by the commission.Now further questions have been asked about whether further Met officers have been involved in the placing of bets.The latest information from the commission has led the Met to examine if more of its officers may have placed bets using inside information and whether the force needs to take further action.The commission is continuing to work through data and information it has about bets placed on the election dates that may be suspicious.The Met declined to be drawn on the number of officers involved in the new inquiries. A source said it was not clear how many officers the new information related to. The Met said: “We continue to liaise with the Gambling Commission and are assessing information they have provided.”defaultThe Met also hit back at claims in a newspaper, believed to have come from a Conservative source, that the force had leaked details about the Gambling Commission’s inquiry into the Conservatives.Met senior officers are understood to be furious about what they regard as a smear to try to deflect attention away from the Conservatives’ troubles. A Met spokesperson said: “The allegations that the Met has leaked information are simply untrue.”Another source added: “This is a poor distraction technique.”In letter to Pat McFadden, Labour’s national campaign coordinator, the chief executive of the commission, Andrew Rhodes, said it had asked the people it had been in contact with to treat the matter confidentially.But Rhodes also said this confidentiality requirement “does not preclude other activity relating to the fact of an investigation taking place”.The Gambling Commission investigation is into the use of confidential information to place bets, which could amount to cheating, which is a criminal offence.The relevant legislation is section 42 of the 2005 Gambling Act, with the punishment being a fine or a maximum of two years’ imprisonment. Under the legislation a person cheats at gambling if they do “anything for the purpose of enabling or assisting another person to cheat at gambling”.The law also says: “It is immaterial whether a person who cheats improves his chances of winning anything, or wins anything.”",Election betting: Tories drop two candidates in major U-turn,15,8

Specifically, I did not place any bets on the date of the general election during May (the period under investigation by the Gambling Commission). Furthermore, I am not aware of any family or friends placing bets.""""And for the avoidance of doubt that based on my comment above, the Gambling Commission have obviously not contacted me.""Mr Craig is the founder and chief executive of marketing and PR agency PLMR, with the company's website describing him as ""an expert in political communications, crisis management, and corporate communications"".He also served as a Labour councillor for 17 years in London.A full list of the candidates running for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich is below:Charlie Caiger, independent;Tony Gould, Reform UK;Mike Hallatt, independent;Brett Alistair Mickelburgh, Lib Dems;Dan Pratt, Greens;Patrick Spencer, Conservatives.",Labour candidate Kevin Craig suspended after betting against himself,15,5
109,"Labour and the Lib Dems have been accused of forming a secret election pact after analysis revealed that the parties’ leaders are steering clear of each other’s target seats.Of the 100 constituencies with the smallest swing required for a Lib Dem victory, Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has visited just two since the start of the election campaign, according to data compiled by The Telegraph.Meanwhile, Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, has been to just one of 100 seats needing the smallest swing for a Labour win, raising suspicions of a covert pact between the parties to oust the Tories.A Conservative Party spokesman claimed it proved the parties had struck an election deal.Andrew Lewer, the Tory candidate for Northampton South, said: “If Starmer and Davey are teaming up and believe that a vote for one is as good as a vote for the other, then they should come right out and say so.”In theory, Labour and the Lib Dems could form a pact to maximise Conservative losses by pulling resources from areas where the other is considered more likely to topple a Tory incumbent.For Labour, this would mean focusing on seats in the north of England that fell to the Conservatives in 2019, while the Lib Dems are said to have the best chance of winning in the Blue Wall, traditional Tory heartlands concentrated in the south of England and the Home Counties.By diverting their efforts away from one another’s target seats, the parties could seek to avoid splitting the anti-Tory vote in some of the Conservatives’ most vulnerable constituencies, giving them a better shot at inflicting a historic defeat on the Government on July 4.Both Labour and the Lib Dems have denied forming a pact, with Sir Ed publicly rejecting the prospect of any election deals with Labour last year. However, analysis by The Telegraph has found that both leaders are largely avoiding seats where the other appears to be in a strong position to beat the Tories.Of the Lib Dems’ top 100 target seats, defined by The Telegraph as those needing the smallest swing for a Lib Dem win, Sir Keir has visited only two as of last Friday – Finchley and Golders Green, in north London, and York Outer, both Tory-held.Of Labour’s top 100 targets, Sir Ed had visited just one – Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, in Scotland, which is held by the SNP. While Labour would win with a smaller swing, it is also a target seat for the Lib Dems, ranking 69th on their list.Sir Keir has not visited any seats currently held by the Lib Dems, while Sir Ed has been to only one with an incumbent Labour candidate.The Tories claimed Sir Keir was not bothering to challenge the Lib Dems because, no matter how many seats they win, “he knows they won’t oppose Labour on anything”.It comes as a separate analysis by the Financial Times found that Labour was sending activists away from Lib Dem-Tory battlegrounds.The FT reported that volunteers in Somerset, a key Lib Dem target area, have been ordered to travel more than 80 miles to Plymouth, while those in London have been advised to steer clear of seats favoured by Sir Ed’s party in the south-west of the capital.A Conservative Party spokesman said: “This pact just goes to show the Lib Dems are all too happy to go along with Labour’s retirement tax and £2,094 tax raid on working households.“Labour isn’t opposing the Lib Dems because, no matter how many seats the Liberals win, Keir Starmer knows they won’t oppose Labour on anything. The only thing the more Lib Dem MPs would mean is Starmer being dragged even further to the Left.”",Labour and Lib Dems accused of secret pact over target seats,15,11

Meanwhile, Rishi Sunak's Conservative Party is on track to lose 262 seats, leaving it with just 110 left, which would be one of its worst-ever defeats.However, if there's one thing recent political events over the past decade have told us, pollsters don't always get it right and there may yet be a few surprises after voters head to polls on 4 July.

The programme will be another head-to-head clash between Mr Sunak and Mr Starmer only, similar to the ITV debate they took part in on June 4, and hosted by Mishal Husain.It will kick off at 8:15pm and run until 9:30pm.The programme was intended to be hosted by Sophie Raworth, but she has since been asked to step down after fracturing her ankle, according to the BBC.Sir Keir agreed to only two head-to-head discussions at the beginning of the election campaign, saying he would not speak at any of the larger TV debates happening either.Question Time special – June 28, 8pm on the BBCFollowing complaints from the leader of Reform after he was not invited to attend the first Question Time special, the broadcaster has announced a second programme on Friday June 28.The corporation said it had added the second billing to its election coverage to reflect “the fact that it is clear from across a broad range of opinion polls that the support for Reform UK has been growing”.Mr Farage had demanded a spot on Thursday’s programme after an opinion poll put his party ahead of the Conservatives and has said he is “pleased” with the BBC’s recognition of his party’s growing favour.The Question Time special will be hosted by Fiona Bruce from 8pm and the Green Party has also been invited to attend.How many debates will there be before the election?Seven debates were being held in the run-up to July 4, with two left to go following the BBC’s special Question Time broadcast on June 20.The first head-to-head debate between Mr Sunak and Sir Keir on June 4 came before a seven-way BBC debate on June 7 which saw Nigel Farage, Penny Mordaunt and Angela Rayner battle it out alongside four other leading party representatives.The Labour and Tory party leaders then featured again in Sky News’ The Battle for Number 10 programme on June 12.On June 13, Nigel Farage, Penny Mordaunt and Angela Rayner returned alongside four other party leaders in a second seven-way election debate hosted by ITV, which included 90 minutes of questioning.The four main party leaders Mr Sunak, Sir Keir, the SNP’s John Swinney and Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, took part in the most recent television special on June 20. The leaders did not go head to head and instead were given 30-minute slots to answer audience questions.The debate announcements were confirmed after the Tories had pressed Sir Keir to take part in a record six debates during the six-week election countdown.Conservative sources had dubbed the opposition leader “the knight that won’t fight” and “Sir Fear Starmer” after he failed to sign up to their weekly debate demand.Labour headquarters indicated instead that their leader would take part in two head-to-head debates against Mr Sunak, matching what Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn did before the 2019 election.What channels are the debates on?The BBC, ITV and Sky News have hosted election debates in an array of formats.All broadcasts from the BBC are available on BBC1, BBC News and are live on the corporation’s streaming platform BBC Iplayer. It is also airing some debates on local radio.The ITV leaders’ debate is available on its steaming service ITVX.Each platform has also streamed programmes on YouTube.The Telegraph is providing live coverage of all the debates with expert analysis and reaction.Will the debates clash with any football fixtures?There have been several clashes between debate timings and football fixtures – an inevitability with the jam-packed TV schedules.Football fans and politics watchers were torn on June 7, when the BBC’s debate with the seven parties coincided with England’s international warm-up with Iceland on Channel 4.England played Denmark the same day as the BBC’s Question Time special, but an earlier kick-off time of 5pm meant the match had finished before the election programme at 8pm.Who won the previous debates?June 4, ITV leaders’ debateMr Sunak seemed extraordinarily confident and put in one of the best performances seen in an election debate, Janet Daley said.Tom Harris, conversely, held that Sir Keir Starmer made more of the opportunity, effectively skewering the Prime Minister on his party’s record in government.June 7, BBC leaders’ debateSherelle Jacobs held that Nigel Farage made real inroads in his bid to overtake the Tories as the preferred party of the Right.But Tom Harris was not convinced, saying that Stephen Flynn, Westminster leader of the SNP, and Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth fared best.June 12, Sky News’s The Battle for Number 10Tim Stanley said the public came out worse from the tetchy encounter on Sky.Tom Harris argued that Sir Keir’s swagger saw him struggle under scrutiny, whereas Janet Daley said Mr Sunak was more convincing.June 13, ITV leaders’ debateFor Tim Stanley, Nigel Farage and Stephen Flynn were the big winners.Sam Ashworth-Hayes said Angela Rayner showed some awareness of the need for big ideas to fix the NHS.Tom Harris argued that the main loser was the audience, since every single participant in the debate appeared together at the June 7 BBC debate.June 20, BBC Question Time leaders’ interviews specialSam Ashworth-Hayes said Sir Ed Davey and John Swinney did not fare well in their 30-minute interrogations.For Tim Stanley, Sir Keir Starmer’s answers had all been heard before and Mr Sunak’s “hands were lively but his face dead”.When is the general election?The general election will take place on July 4 as the country heads to the polls between 7am and 10pm to have their say over the next prime minister.It was confirmed by Mr Sunak in a rain-sodden speech outside Downing Street on May 22 that the election would happen six weeks later. Both the Prime Minister and other party leaders have been on the campaign trail since then in a bid to win over voters.",What time is the election debate tonight?

28,"Alister Jack said he claimed to have won £2,100 as ""a joke"". Wiktor Szymanowicz via Getty ImagesA cabinet minister has become the most senior Tory to admit putting bets on the date of the election.Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said he laid three wagers, but only one of them came up.He was forced to issue a statement after the BBC reported that he had told them he won £2,100 on the July poll - a claim he later said was “a joke”.Jack said: “Following reports today I want to be absolutely clear I have not breached any gambling rules.“I placed two unsuccessful bets on the date of the general election and one successful one. I put two bets on in March of £5 each for an election to be held in May and June respectively. In April, I put £20 at 5 to 1 on an election being held between July and September.“I had no knowledge of the date of the election until the day it was called. As I have said previously, I placed no bets in May and am not under investigation by the Gambling Commission.”The Tories yesterday dumped two candidates over the betting scandal which has overshadowed that last two weeks of the election campaign.The party’s campaign director and chief data officer have also taken leaves of absence over the controversy, while one of Rishi Sunak’s close protection officers has also been arrested.Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Police has confirmed that the Gambling Commission has told them that five further officers also allegedly placed bets on the election date.The Labour Party also became embroiled in the controversy last night after it dropped a candidate who placed a bet on himself to lose.Kevin Craig, who is standing for Labour in Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, is also being investigated by the Gambling Commission.He said: “A few weeks ago, when I thought I would never win this seat, I put a bet on the Tories to win here with the intention of giving any winnings to local charities.“While I did not place this bet with any prior knowledge of the outcome, this was a huge mistake, for which I apologise unreservedly.”Related...A Tory Candidate At The Centre Of A Betting Scandal Has Begged Voters To Stand By HimLabour Suspends Candidate Accused Of Betting On Himself To LoseA Minister Has Criticised Rishi Sunak's Handling Of The Tory Betting Scandal",Cabinet Minister Admits Placing Bets On The Date Of The Election,16,3
116,"Labour has rebuilt its relationship with low-income people and is no longer “out of touch”, according to a new study by a major think-tank, while the Conservatives have lost ground significantly.Five years ago, Labour was seen as the most “out of touch” party, according to voters on the lowest incomes (some 6 million households with an income of less than £21,000).Nearly half of those questioned in 2019 (45 per cent) regarded Labour as ‘out of touch”. But this figure has plummeted under Sir Keir Starmer’s leadership with just of a quarter of low-income people (27 per cent) now taking this view.The Conservative Party now hold this unenviable reputation with 40 per cent of the poorest voters seeing it as out of touch, up 6 per cent since 2019.Starmer has rebuilt trust with Britain’s poorest (Jane Barlow/PA)The figures come from Breadline Britain’s Election Battleground, a new report from the Centre for Social Justice, which commissioned polling by Survation.Labour is overwhelmingly the most popular party amongst the poorest, with half of those polled saying they would vote for it. This is a 14 per cent increase since 2019. Meanwhile, Conservative support among this group has dropped by 8 per cent to just 15 per cent overall.However, despite Labour regaining ground among low-income voters, the report warns that politicians remain deeply unpopular, with more than half of low-income voters, 57 per cent, saying that “no political party really cares about helping people like me”.It points to a clear disconnect between low-income voters and the politicians who are meant to represent them. Over three quarters (76 per cent) of the poorest say they have never met or spoken to their local MP.Under Jeremy Corbyn Labour was seen as out of touch (Lucy North/PA) (PA Wire)The report is unequivocal: “there is absolutely no change across the five years in the proportions of low-income voters who think the Conservative and Labour parties don’t understand what it’s like to struggle”.The CSJ’s analysis identifies five clear national challenges that the next government need to focus on: good work, stable families, strong communities, public safety, and giving children the best start in life.They go on to provide five recommendations for political parties looking to win the votes of low-income households: Make work pay, create safe streets, build stable communities, support fragile families, and champion the lost generation .Andy Cook, chief executive of the Centre for Social Justice, said: “The more voters feel listened to by a party, the more in-touch the parties are, the more likely they are to vote for that party.“It is time for all parties to make social justice their priority. Not simply because it is the right thing to do, but because it strengthens our democracy and re-engages people with their political representatives. Only this will end lure of the populists, with their “curse on all your houses” politics, who want us to waste our vote in protest, rather than on solutions.“I am an optimist. We can do better. If we focus on the long-term root causes of our troubles – like making work pay and supporting fragile families - rather than quick-fix sticking plasters, then we have the talent and resources to rebuild our future.”","Starmer has rebuilt Labour’s trust with Britain’s poorest, new research finds",16,9
389,"“Change through economic stability”. This is the mantra which is about to float Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour Party to an overwhelming majority in next week’s general election.As a campaigning message, it hardly sets the pulse racing. But it’s also what people want after the chaos of recent years.The nation has had enough excitement. It craves more settled, middle of the road government, according to the polls, even if that means a rising tax burden. Stability is in itself change.Labour doesn’t have to promise the earth to win; all it has to do is promote the idea that it can provide the competent government that has so sadly eluded us these past eight years.Whether Labour can in practice achieve such an outcome is another matter. It may be that the challenges are just too great. Or the below-the-surface divisions in the Labour coalition too disabling. But luck may be on its side.Rishi Sunak and his Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, aspired to the same thing, and indeed went some way to delivering it.Yet the brand had already been trashed by what went before; restoring the required sense of calm in the time available to them was always a hopeless task.In any case, it is their economic legacy that Labour will shortly be building on, and it’s actually not nearly as bad as widely portrayed. Labour’s shadow chancellor calls it the worst economic inheritance since the Second World War, but if that’s true, why does she propose to do so little about it?Instead, Labour promises only more of the same. There are a few tweaks to tax and spend but nothing that might unduly frighten the horses.If the manifesto is to be believed, headline rates of income tax, National Insurance, VAT and corporation tax will remain unchanged, the spending envelope is only slightly increased, and ministers will be bound by virtually the same fiscal rules as the present government.We can expect a change of tone, outlook and faces in Downing Street, but not much else. It’s scarcely going to seem like a new beginning. On the broad outline of economic policy, the direction of travel looks little different from the present trajectory.Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, calls it a “conspiracy of silence”, with neither of the two main parties prepared to face up to the scale of the challenges in the public finances.He says: “Regardless of who takes office following the general election, they will – unless they get lucky – soon face a stark choice. Raise taxes by more than they have told us in their manifesto. Or implement cuts to some areas of spending. Or borrow more and be content for debt to rise for longer.“That is the trilemma. What will they choose? The manifestos have left us guessing.”But are things really quite as desperate as the IFS chief paints them? He adds an important qualification – “unless they get lucky”. Here’s how that luck might play out.Most things in economics are relative and compared to much of the rest of Europe, Britain’s position already looks pretty good.Our first past the post electoral system is about to deliver Labour a huge working majority, and although this might be seen as a licence to do stupid things, much more likely is that Labour’s leaders will interpret it in the way the electorate meant: as a mandate for predictable, centrist and competent government.If Labour wants a second term it would be well advised to keep the markets sweet, and focus like a laser on planning, NHS and public sector reform. Disillusionment with the Tories only works once as an electoral weapon.Contrast this with the political chaos unleashed in France by President Emmanuel Macron’s petulant decision to call a snap parliamentary election. This is already looking extremely dangerous for Europe’s fragile monetary union, even if you wouldn’t bet against it given the determination European leaders have shown to date in sustaining it.Yet Paris is a mainstay of the whole construct and if it is kicked away by the deluded demands of the French Right and Left, then there is a real possibility of the whole thing tumbling down.At the very least, continental Europe seems destined to enter another chaotic age. Set against this, the UK may come to be seen as a safe haven, and a consequent magnet for international capital.Nobody in their right mind would invest in France as things stand. Assuming Labour doesn’t similarly turn the nation into a no-go area for commerce, Britain ought to be a major beneficiary of this capital flight.At last there might be some purpose in Brexit, in that it would partially shield the UK from Europe’s descent into economic anarchy. Political stability isn’t everything when it comes to economic growth, but it is an essential backdrop.Labour’s hopes of more benign economic conditions are further underpinned by the natural rhythm of the cycle. Much of the current mess can be attributed to the pandemic, or rather the Government’s response to it, and the subsequent energy price shock.The after-effects are proving more persistent than we might have hoped, but they are gradually fading, with the economy beginning to function normally once more after the pummelling it’s been through.The biggest reason the public finances are in such dire straits is that there has been a £50bn increase in debt servicing costs as a result of higher interest rates.These extra costs help explain why the tax burden has risen to record peacetime levels even as public services are squeezed to the point where they no longer operate properly.They thought zero interest rates would last forever, and spent accordingly. How stupid can you get?Debt servicing costs are admittedly very unlikely to return to the much lower levels that existed three years ago, but they should abate to some degree at least.That said, Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are already based on growth accelerating from next year onwards, and on debt interest payments falling from around 4pc to 3pc of GDP; yet even so, the Government still struggles to stay within its fiscal rules.To get out of jail free Labour needs higher growth still, or a sustained average of 2pc or more over the years ahead. Fortunately, this is not altogether implausible even with much lower levels of net immigration.One thing that will undoubtedly help is the application of artificial intelligence. It’s impossible to know how much this might boost productivity, but my guess is that it will be by a lot. Even if it’s by no more than the information technology revolution of the 1990s and noughties, it still promises to make a big difference.Forget the worst economic inheritance since the War. By luck rather than design, Labour may be about to fall on its feet.",Sir Keir Starmer is about to discover just how lucky he really is,16,11
335,"The number of politicians caught up in the betting scandal has risen to seven after a cabinet minister admitted placing bets on the date of the general election.Scotland Secretary Alister Jack placed three wagers on the timing of the 4 July poll, but said he has not breached any gambling rules.As well as seven politicians, the Gambling Commission is investigating five Metropolitan Police officers, and one constable has already been arrested and questioned.On Tuesday, Labour was drawn into the scandal, suspending candidate Kevin Craig after being told the Gambling Commission has launched an investigation into him.Mr Craig said he “deeply” regrets putting a bet on the Tories winning in the Suffolk constituency he is contesting and will “fully comply” with a Gambling Commission investigation.Following pressure from opponents and his own party, on Tuesday Rishi Sunak suspended two candidates.

They are not supported as Conservative candidates in this election.“Indeed, the Prime Minister has been very clear that in the event that they are found to have broken the rules by the Gambling Commission, they will be expelled from the Conservative Party.”Seven politicians caught up in election betting scandal08:43 , Maryam Zakir-HussainThe Westminster gambling row has deepened after a cabinet minister revealed he had placed bets on the date of the general election, as the number of politicians involved rises to seven.Scotland secretary Alister Jack denied having broken any rules but said he put three wagers on the timing of the July 4 poll, becoming the latest of seven politicians and officials to get drawn in to the controversy.Labour was also dragged into the row on Tuesday, with the party suspending its candidate Kevin Craig after it emerged he had bet that he would lose to the Tories in the contest for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich.Mr Jack said he had in April put £20 at odds of 5 to 1 on an election being held between July and September, but that he had no knowledge of when it would be called until the day that Rishi Sunak fired the starting gun on May 22.Four arrests at Rishi Sunak’s house after man filmed leaving dirty protest in his lake08:37 , Maryam Zakir-HussainFour men have been arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass at Rishi Sunak’s constituency home, as video appears to show an intruder carrying out a dirty protest in a lake at the property.The men were detained at around 12.40pm on Tuesday before being escorted off the prime minister’s property in Kirby Sigston, North Yorkshire Police said.The force added that the men included one 52-year-old from London, one 43-year-old from Bolton, one 21-year-old from Manchester, and one 20-year-old from Chichester.Four arrests at Sunak’s house after protester leaves ‘parting gift’ in his lakePM backs Kemi Badenock in David Tennant row08:19 , Maryam Zakir-HussainRishi Sunak has backed Kemi Badenoch in the row with David Tennant, after the actor said he wishes the Tory minister would “shut up”.The prime minister posted on X: “ Freedom of speech is the most powerful feature of our democracy.

And that’s why after internal inquiries, he took that decision - I think it was right to do so - to suspend some of those candidates that are standing in the election, so I think the right steps have been taken.” (PA)What to expect on the General Election campaign trail on Wednesday07:24 , Maryam Zakir-HussainThe gloves come offRishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer will make their closing arguments to the nation as they go head to head in their final TV debate before polling day next week.The scandal over candidates and officials betting on the timing of the election will loom large over Wednesday’s clash after a Cabinet minister became the latest figure to say he had placed bets on the timing of the vote.Labour’s family doctor promiseLabour will talk up its pledge to end the 8am scramble for GP appointments by training more doctors and updating the NHS app so slots are easy to book and rearrange.Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting will be promoting the message, saying his party is also committed to bringing back the family doctor, to give patients continuity.The blue wall and the yellowWhile Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey continues campaigning across traditionally Tory heartlands in southern England, his Scottish counterpart will be in the south-east of Scotland.Reform UK chairman Richard Tice will be in Scotland giving a speech on net zero and “saving the oil and gas industry”.Starmer has rebuilt Labour’s trust with Britain’s poorest, new research finds07:20 , Maryam Zakir-HussainLabour has rebuilt its relationship with low-income people and is no longer “out of touch”, according to a new study by a major think-tank, while the Conservatives have lost ground significantly.Five years ago, Labour was seen as the most “out of touch” party, according to voters on the lowest incomes (some 6 million households with an income of less than £21,000).Nearly half of those questioned in 2019 (45 per cent) regarded Labour as ‘out of touch”.

pressure and withdrew the Conservative Party’s support for two candidates embroiled in the betting scandal.The Tories have dropped Craig Williams and Laura Saunders, both of whom are linked to the prime minister’s inner circle and are under investigation by the commission.But two weeks after allegations first emerged even a Conservative former cabinet minister asked “why did it take so

Under FPTP, it is the candidate who gets the most votes that wins.It may seem like the most democratic system to decide a winner at first glance, but many argue that FPTP does not always produce results that reflect the political leanings of the area.You can read more belowWhat is tactical voting and how could it affect the general election result?Labour donor claims UK should cease farming on 75% of farmlandTuesday 25 June 2024 17:30 , Salma OuaguiraOne of Labour’s donors has claimed that the UK should cease farming on 75 per cent of the country’s farmland to “give back to nature”.Dale Vince, who has donated more than £5 million to Labour’s election campaign, described farming livestock as an “inefficient system”.He said: “If we all stop eating animals today, tomorrow, whenever in our country, we can free up 75 per cent of that farmland, right?“And that 75 per cent of 75 per cent, do the maths, that’s half of our entire country that we can give back to nature.”Steve Barclay, the Environment Secretary, said: “With Labour’s biggest backers wanting to close down farms to rewild them it is clear they simply have no idea about our rural communities.”Tuesday 25 June 2024 17:22 , Howard MustoeLabour suspends parliamentary candidate over betting investigationLabour has suspended parliamentary candidate Kevin Craig after being told the Gambling Commission has launched an investigation into him.PR boss Craig was standing in Central Suffolk and North Ipswich.Tory candidate in betting scandal hopes to still be re-electedTuesday 25 June 2024 17:00 , Salma OuaguiraCraig Williams said he remained committed to his campaign to be re-elected as an MP after the Conservatives withdrew their support for him.He said in his video statement: “In all these things, due process is important and that is what sets the UK apart from other countries, and the commission must be allowed to do its work.“It’s been a privilege for me to be the Member of Parliament for the constituency where I was born, raised and now live with my young family.“I have been working hard, helping thousands of constituents with our team with everything from benefits to housing, from potholes to energy bills, as well as securing an unprecedented level of investment in our local businesses, communities and high streets, and finally sticking up for farmers, because without farmers there is no food, and without food there is no future.“For now, however, the most important thing I want to say to you today is I am committed to my campaign to be elected as your Member of Parliament and your staunch champion.”Watch: Lib Dem leader Ed Davey cries as he shares struggles of caring for his disabled sonTuesday 25 June 2024 16:30 , Salma OuaguiraActivists defecate Rishi Sunak’s private lakeTuesday 25 June 2024 16:10 , Salma Ouaguira🚨 BREAKING: Youth Demand have taken a sh*t in Rishi Sunak's private lake to ""give the Tories exactly what they have given us -

127,"Mel Stride (second from left) has defended Alister Jack (second from right). STEFAN ROUSSEAU via Getty ImagesA Tory minister who placed bets on the date of the general election did nothing wrong, one of his cabinet colleagues has insisted.Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has admitted he laid three wagers, but only one of them came up.He was forced to issue a statement after the BBC reported that he had told them he won £2,100 on the July poll - a claim he later said was “a joke”.In a statement, Jack said: “I placed two unsuccessful bets on the date of the general election and one successful one. I put two bets on in March of £5 each for an election to be held in May and June respectively. In April, I put £20 at 5 to 1 on an election being held between July and September.“I had no knowledge of the date of the election until the day it was called.”The revelation came just hours after the Conservatives ditched two candidates under investigation from the Gambling Commission over claims they also bet on the election date.Meanwhile, Labour has withdrawn its support for one of its candidates after it emerged he is being investigated for placing a bet on himself to lose.On Sky News this morning, work and pensions secretary Mel Stride said it was important to draw a distinctions between the actions of Alister Jack and the other Conservatives being probed.Presenter Wilfred Frost said: “I just wonder whether any politician should be placing a bet on something that they do broadly have influence over, or certainly comes into their sphere of influence, in the same way that footballers are banned from placing bets even on a fixture that their team isn’t involved in.“Is that where we should end up, that politicians should not bet at all on politics?”Stride replied: “I think you are totally right to identify that there are different circumstances around different people.“You’ve got a Labour candidate for example who was actually placing bets against himself on the basis that he would lose the election that he’s fighting, which is pretty extraordinary.“Alister Jack is a completely different circumstance and it appears that no wrongdoing has occurred in his case.”BBC’s Newsnight programme last night reported that the Gambling Commission is investigating 15 Tory candidates and officials over betting on the election date.Rishi Sunak has said anyone found guilty of doing so will be kicked out of the Tory Party.Related...A Tory Candidate At The Centre Of A Betting Scandal Has Begged Voters To Stand By HimCabinet Minister Admits Placing Bets On The Date Of The ElectionA Minister Has Criticised Rishi Sunak's Handling Of The Tory Betting Scandal","Cabinet Minister Who Bet On Election Date Did Nothing Wrong, Says Mel Stride",16,3
292,"Tens of thousand of people with sight loss will be denied their right to a secret ballot at next week’s general election, campaigners have warned, prompting calls to make it the last inaccessible election.The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) is calling on all political parties to commit to remove barriers that prevent blind people voting on their own and without help in future elections.It estimates that 160,000 people in the UK of voting age with severe sight loss will struggle to vote independently because of the lack adjustments made at polling stations.At the last general election, research for the RNIB found that only 13% of blind people felt they could vote independently and in secret.In a 2019 court judgment, the voting arrangements for blind and partially sighted people were declared unlawful and a “parody of the electoral process”.In polling stations, blind and partially sighted people are still only legally entitled to a selector – a plastic overlay on voting papers featuring braille numbers to help identify candidates. It involves being accompanied into the voting booth and having voting choices read out.More sophisticated audio readers, which do allow secret voting, are available only to those who request them in advance.The RNIB chair of trustees, Anna Tylor, has written an open letter to the next government warning that she, and tens of thousands of other blind and partially sighted people, are being robbed of the “right to a secret vote”. Citing the report on the 2019 election, she said: “Some reported having to tell someone how they wanted to vote, and heard others scoff at their choice; others had their selection audibly pointed out for everyone to hear.”She added: “This must be the last election where people with sight loss are so disenfranchised.”Jemma Brown, 35, who plans to vote next week in the Southampton Itchen constituency, said: “I do feel my right to a secret vote is treated as less important than everyone else’s. I am always relying on another person, so I do take a deep breath when I walk into my polling station.“Almost every time we have an election, I have train the staff myself to be able to cast my vote.”Speaking to the Guardian, she recalled that at a recent election for a police and crime commissioner the officer helping her skipped the name of one candidate. She said: “It meant I voted for the wrong person and had to cross it out. I have no idea whether that vote will have counted.”Brown added: “The system is so archaic. It’s 2024 and the best we can offer blind and visually impaired people is a sheet of plastic that someone else has to stick on their voting cards.”","Make this the last inaccessible election for blind people in UK, campaigners demand",16,8
369,"When polls close on July 4 after a six-week campaign, Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer will eagerly await results from the UK’s 650 constituencies to find out who will become the next prime minister.The exit poll at 10pm will give the Prime Minister and the Labour leader a snapshot of what to expect nationally, before the first results start to trickle in across the following hours.Opinion polls in recent weeks have suggested the Conservatives are on track to win as few as 53 seats, although other surveys suggest they could win around 150. Labour is currently projected to win a landslide, with some polls suggesting Sir Keir could achieve a greater victory margin than Sir Tony Blair.A recent Telegraph poll predicted Mr Sunak could become the first ever Prime Minister to lose his seat at a general election.Read the latest election pollsFollow The Telegraph’s general election live coverageHere is everything you need to know about the election night timings.When will election results be announced?Results from the 2024 general election will begin to trickle in from around 11.30pm on Thursday July 4 after polling stations close at 10pm.Most of the constituency results are expected in the early hours of Friday, July 5 as hundreds are announced across the country, with the final seats projected to announce their winning candidates by 6.30am.In 2019, the first declaration came at 11.27pm when Newcastle City Council beat local rival Sunderland to announce Labour’s candidate Chi Onwurah as the first MP of the new parliament.The record for the earliest declaration remains 10.43pm by the former seat of Sunderland South in 2001.Use our tool below to find out when your constituency is expected to declare:What are some of the key results to watch out for?All eyes will be on Richmond and Northallerton at around 4am when Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, will find out whether he has kept his seat, amid some predictions that he could be ousted by his constituents in what would be a historic defeat for an incumbent of Downing Street.The result in Holborn and St Pancras, the constituency of Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, is expected 15 minutes later.A host of top Tories will learn throughout the night whether they have won re-election, including Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg (around 4.30am), Grant Shapps, the Defence Secretary (around 3.30am) and Jeremy Hunt, the Chancellor (around 3.30am). Mr Hunt has predicted there will be fewer than 1,500 votes between him and the Liberal Democrat hopeful.Nigel Farage, the Reform leader, will learn at around 4am whether he has succeeded at the eighth time in trying in winning a seat in the Commons.An hour earlier, Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader, is set to find out whether he will beat his old party and retain his seat in Islington North, where he is standing as an independent candidate.When was the 2019 election result called?Boris Johnson won a landslide victory for the Tories in 2019 after selling the public on his mandate to “get Brexit done”.The first exit poll came back as Big Ben struck 10pm and polling stations closed nationwide, while Mr Johnson’s overall majority was confirmed at 5am.By 7am, it became clear the Tories were on course for their biggest majority at Westminster since that of Margaret Thatcher.What happens when results start being called?When voting closes, an exit poll will be announced following a survey of voters taken from about 150 constituencies in England, Scotland and Wales, giving an indication of the likely result.However, leaders will have to wait until one party receives enough votes for a majority under the first-past-the-post electoral system.In 2019, Mr Johnson’s majority was announced at 5am, although it was not until every constituency had called its results that the extent of his landslide victory with a 43 per cent vote share emerged.When is the general election?The UK will head to the polls on Thursday July 4 to vote on the country’s next leader, with polling stations open between 7am and 10pm.The Prime Minister announced the snap summer election in a rain-sodden speech outside Downing Street on May 22, setting in motion the vote six weeks later.Registration for the general election has now closed and it is too late to apply for a postal vote. However, those eligible can still use a proxy ballot to have someone vote on their behalf.Hour-by-hour timetable of the nightThursday, 10pmIt’s exit poll o’clock at 10pm, as a nationwide projection offers a unique window on the outcome.The 10pm ballot has an impressive track record and gives a pretty good indication of what the final result will be.11pmBlyth and Ashington, a new constituency where veteran Labour MP Ian Lavery is seeking re-election, is expected to be the first constituency to declare at this election, with an estimated time of 11.30pm.

Party leader Nigel Farage will hope he has won a seat in the Commons at the eighth time of trying as the result comes in for Clacton, while Richard Tice, the Reform chairman, is hoping to unseat former Tory minister Matt Warman by the seaside in Boston and Skegness.Reform’s only current MP is Lee Anderson, a former deputy Tory chairman who crossed the floor in March following his suspension. He is hoping the former mining town of Ashfield, which traditionally opted for Labour but went Tory in 2019, will stick with him after his change of allegiances, as many Labour-turned-Tory voters now

After 72 hours the poll closes and, each Friday, we'll publish and analyse the results, giving readers the chance to see how polarising a topic has become and if their view chimes with other Yahoo UK readers.Voters will head to the polls on 4 July for a snap general election called by Rishi Sunak. (Getty Images)With just over a week to go until the general election, Labour are still on track to win a historic majority in the Commons, according to a number of polls.One of the latest, carried out by research company Focaldata, predicts a 250-seat majority for Sir Keir Starmer's party, with a total of 450 seats. Meanwhile, Rishi Sunak's Conservative Party is on track to lose 262 seats, leaving it with just 110 left, which would be one of its worst-ever defeats.However, if there's one thing recent political events over the past decade have told us, pollsters don't always get it right and there may yet be a few surprises after voters head to polls on 4 July. Never forget that a week is a long time in politics,Nigel Farage's Reform UK is expected to win one seat, according to Focaldata, but YouGov pollster Patrick English claimed in early June that the populist party could win as many as four. The Liberal Democrats are expected to make sizeable gains and reclaim their place as the third biggest party in the Commons, while the SNP are predicted to suffer heavy losses following a turbulent period for the Scottish separatist party.Meanwhile, the Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer could win one new seat in Bristol Central by gaining votes from left-wing voters dismayed by Starmer's so-called ""purge"" of leftist candidates.As of 25 June, YouGov's Voting Intention tracker suggests 36% of voters will choose Labour, compared to 20% for the Tories, who are followed closely by Reform at 18%. The pollster suggests a 14% result for the Lib Dems, compared to 7% for the Greens and 3% for the SNP.But what do you think?

376,"With little over a week to go until the general election, five separate opinion polls continue to show a large Labour lead over the Conservatives.Prime minister Rishi Sunak will have been hoping to make a dent in Labour’s position but the campaign has been far from perfect for the Tories. It is now looking ever-more likely that Sir Keir Starmer will be prime minister by next Friday.Nigel Farage may yet have a good election night as Reform UK are currently in third place in the polls. The polling for the party has slipped following the controversy over Farage’s comments about the war in Ukraine but the party is still some five percentage points ahead of the Lib Dems.Yahoo News UK summaries the positions of the parties the five polls.No major changes show Labour on course for large victoryA poll by Savanta puts Labour on 42% – 21 points ahead of the Tories, who are on 21%. Ipsos also puts Labour on 42%, compared to 19% for the Tories, while JL Partners give similar results, with Labour on 41% and the Tories on 25%.A Verian poll shows Labour on 38%, with the Tories on 21%, while Survation show Labour on 41%, compared to a historic low of 18% for the Tories.An average of opinion polls from February to June this year. (PA)An average of all polls with survey work completed during the seven days to 26 June puts Labour on 41%, 21 points ahead of the Conservatives on 20%, followed by Reform on 16%, the Lib Dems on 11% and the Greens on 6% – unchanged on the figures for the previous week.On 22 May, the day Sunak called the election, the seven-day averages stood at Labour 45%, Conservatives 23%, Reform 11%, Lib Dems 9% and Greens 6%.Tories to slump to lowest number of seats since party's formationEarlier this month, three major polls showed the Tories were on course for a historic defeat, slumping to the lowest number of seats since the party was formed.Using the multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP) technique, which enables projections to be made at constituency level, YouGov's polling for Sky News projected Labour being on course to achieve a 200-seat majority. The poll suggested Labour would secure 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.The YouGov poll for Sky News.A More In Common UK poll for the News Agents podcast showed Labour projecting to finish on 406 seats, with the Conservatives on 155.Meanwhile, polling by Savanta and Electoral Calculus for the Telegraph, showed Sunak could become the first sitting prime minister to lose his seat of Richmond and Northallerton to Labour. It put Labour on 516 seats, with the Tories on just 53.What are the latest odds?As of 26 June, Oddschecker – a website which compares odds across different bookmakers – had Labour at 1/41 to win the most seats. To put that in context, this is seen as so likely that a £10 bet would return just £10.24.The Conservatives are 80/1 to win the most seats, a scenario seen as so unlikely that a £10 punt would return £810.A Conservative majority government is also seen as so unlikely (125/1) that Oddschecker sees a Reform UK government as more likely (100/1).What went wrong for the Tories?YouGov's voting intention tracker between January 2020 and June 2024. (YouGov)So, why have the polls changed so dramatically? It's worth looking back on an extremely eventful four-and-a-half years in UK politics.According to YouGov's voting intention tracker (see chart, above), Tory support peaked at 53%, with Labour on 32%, in April 2020, months after the party's stunning success in the 2019 general election and Boris Johnson's pledge to “get Brexit done”. That month also saw Starmer take over as Labour leader from Jeremy Corbyn.This was also amid a spirit of national unity following the onset of the COVID pandemic which nearly killed Johnson himself. The then-PM had been released from hospital five days before this particular survey was taken.Boris Johnson delivers his final speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street in September 2022. (AFP via Getty Images)Over the rest of the year, there was a downturn in support amid chaos over COVID rules, with the Tories falling as low as 35% in November 2020, compared to Labour on 40%.However, the UK’s successful COVID vaccination programme provided a pathway out of lockdown and with it, improved poll ratings. Tory support peaked at 41% in June 2021, with Labour at 30%.In October that year, there was a sense Johnson was untouchable. At the Tory party conference, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg remarked how the PM was ""in total command of his party, and politically dominant in the country"".But this fell apart quickly with the Partygate scandal, which emerged in November that year. Time and again, reports emerged of government and Tory staff – including Johnson – having taken part in lockdown-era social gatherings when their own COVID rules had prohibited them.By January 2022, Tory support had plummeted to 28%, with Labour on 38%. Johnson struggled on, but never recovered and a wave of ministerial resignations forced him to resign in July that year.The UK had three separate prime ministers – Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak – between 6 September and 24 October, 2022. (Getty Images)His successor, Liz Truss, then embarked on arguably the most disastrous prime ministerial reign in history, characterised by the catastrophic ""mini-budget"", containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, which prompted an economic crisis. Like Johnson, she lost the confidence of Tory MPs – and voters – and had to resign.Her 49-day spell as PM was the shortest in history, with Tory support plummeting to 19% (with Labour on 56%) the day after she announced her resignation in October 2022.Rishi Sunak, who had lost to Truss in the previous month's Tory leadership election, took over. However, as the above YouGov chart indicates, he has failed to cut through with voters. Tory support was at 23% two days after he assumed office, with the most recent survey, carried out on Thursday, showing support is now lower than under Truss at 18%.In short, the polls and odds, not to mention other factors such as notable by-election victories for Starmer's Labour, are pointing to a Labour government next week.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

If you’re calling for women to shut up and wishing they didn’t exist, you are the problem.”David Tennant poses with the Celebrity Ally award at The British LGBT Awards 2024 in London on Friday (Getty Images)Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he “wouldn’t have engaged in the way” Mr Tennant did, telling broadcasters: “I think in politics, as in life, it’s really important that we are able to robustly disagree with others. Obviously, that happens a lot in the general election campaign, but we should do it with respect for everybody involved in that robust discussion.”The women and equalities minister has fronted the Tory election pledge to make biological sex a protected characteristic in the Equality Act. Currently, gender reassignment is a protected characteristic.Ms Badenoch vowed to continue speaking out and accused Mr Tennant of being a “rich, lefty, white male celebrity so blinded by ideology” in a post to X on Tuesday following his damning remarks made about her at the British LGBT Awards on Friday.Home Secretary James Cleverly was also among those who interjected in the row, calling for Mr Tennant to apologise for his remarks, as he wrote on X: “I’m not sure David understands the irony of trying to silence the voice of the most senior Black female politician in the UK’s history, in the name of ‘defending’ a minority community.”Women and Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch vowed to ‘not shut up’ (PA Wire)Mr Tennant, who won Celebrity Ally at the ceremony, received cheers and applause when he said of the Conservative Cabinet minister: “I don’t wish ill of her, I just wish her to shut up.”Ms Badenoch hit back, saying: “I will not shut up. I will not be silenced by men who prioritise applause from Stonewall over the safety of women and girls.“A rich, lefty, white male celebrity so blinded by ideology he can’t see the optics of attacking the only black woman in government by calling publicly for my existence to end.“Tennant is one of Labour’s celebrity supporters.

73,"If the polls are to be believed, the Tories are in for a historic defeat on July 4.A major survey for The Telegraph this month put the Conservatives on just 53 seats, with high-profile casualties predicted to include Penny Mordaunt, Jeremy Hunt, James Cleverly, and Rishi Sunak himself.Even with a result half as bad as that prediction, it is likely Mr Sunak would resign,  or face an imminent leadership challenge.Here, The Telegraph takes a look at some of the potential contenders to replace him.The Business Secretary, who is also minister for women and equalities, is the current bookies’ favourite to be the next Tory leader. She also had the highest net satisfaction rating of any Cabinet minister among readers of the influential ConservativeHome website in May. She came fourth in the contest to succeed Boris Johnson in July 2022, and has hinted at a potential Tory leadership run after the election. She may be well placed in Westminster, given that Savanta’s bombshell MRP poll for The Telegraph forecast she would be the only “big beast” left standing after polling day.The Leader of the House of Commons came third in the 2022 leadership contest, and boosted her popularity and her name recognition with her prominent ceremonial role at last year’s Coronation. She was the third most popular Cabinet minister among ConservativeHome readers in May. However, if the Savanta projection is correct, she is on track to lose her seat to Labour on July 4.The former home secretary remains popular with the Tory base, who admired her tough stance on illegal migration. However, she might struggle to beat Mrs Badenoch for the support of the Right of the party, having made an early exit in the 2022 leadership race. The Savanta poll also suggests she is set to lose her seat to Labour at the general election.Having served as education secretary, foreign secretary, and now Home Secretary, Mr Cleverly is one of the Cabinet’s more experienced pairs of hands, though he ranked only 14th among ministers in ConservativeHome’s poll in May.  However, the Army Reserve Lieutenant Colonel is yet another Tory heavyweight likely to lose his seat, according to the Savanta survey, threatening to scupper any leadership ambitions he might harbour.The former home secretary is tipped as a grassroots favourite, and was recently urged by supporters to stand for the Tory leadership if the party is defeated at the election. Friends said Ms Patel had not ruled out the possibility of standing but was focused on retaining her Witham constituency in Essex, which she is set to lose to Labour, according to the Savanta poll.The former prime minister, now Foreign Secretary, could technically make a dramatic return as Tory leader, given that there is no requirement for the head of the official opposition (or indeed any opposition party) to hold a seat in the House of Commons. However, such a move would be unprecedented in modern times. The former premier may also pay heed to the fact that he had a negative approval rating with ConservativeHome readers in May.The Reform UK leader is currently doing his level best to unseat as many Tory (and Labour) MPs as possible, presumably making him rather unpopular with the Conservative base. But some have speculated he could take the reins from Mr Sunak by defecting from inside Westminster, if he succeeds in his eighth bid to become an MP.Could Mr Johnson be the Tories’ once and future king? He will not be an MP on July 4, having given up his seat in June last year and opted not to run again. But, like Lord Cameron, he could technically lead from outside Westminster.",The runners and riders to replace Rishi Sunak,16,11
273,"Sir Keir Starmer has taken aim at Rishi Sunak’s leadership ability over the election date betting scandal, accusing the prime minister of “failing to grasp the nettle” and take action quickly enough.The Labour leader’s taunts came on the day that Mr Sunak finally agreed to suspend the candidates, two weeks after the allegations first emerged. The scandal continued to deepen on Tuesday when Scotland Yard confirmed that five more police officers were alleged to have placed bets on the timing of the general election. The Met said it had been passed information on the allegations by the Gambling Commission.Speaking to The Independent, Sir Keir insisted that, had Labour candidates been involved in allegedly trying to use insider information to make bets, they “would have been straight out of the door” and their “feet wouldn’t have touched the ground”.Just a few hours after the interview, the Labour leader made good on his words, suspending Central Suffolk and North Ipswich candidate Kevin Craig after being told he was also being investigated by the Gambling Commission. Sir Keir also handed back Mr Craig’s £100,000 donation to the party.The Labour leader made it clear that the final week of the election campaign would be about character and leadership, and who is best placed to make the tough decisions in government.Sir Keir’s attack on the prime minister had echoes of the 2010 campaign, when Gordon Brown was described as “frit” by David Cameron as he headed towards defeat.Starmer, pictured discussing knife crime with actor Idris Elba on Tuesday, has been critical of the prime minister’s handling of the betting scandal (PA Wire)Craig Williams, the candidate for Montgomeryshire, was Mr Sunak’s parliamentary private secretary, and Laura Saunders, the candidate for Bristol North West, has worked for the party since 2015. Her husband, Tony Lee, has taken leave of absence from his role as the Tory director of campaigns, after he too came under investigation by the Gambling Commission.Sir Keir spoke of his anger at the scandal that has tainted British politics over the last two weeks, and questioned the length of time it took for Mr Sunak to take action.“It’s a failure to grasp the nettle,” he said. “It’s I don't know how many days after the first admission – I think it’s 13 days, and certainly a good week and a bit since [it first broke]. If they had been my candidates, they’d have been straight out of the door and their feet wouldn’t have touched the floor, but to wait a week, to make excuses like that, is inexcusable.”The Labour leader himself has been accused of being slow to take action against candidates in the past, including during the Rochdale by-election in April, when Labour’s candidate Azhar Ali was suspended for repeating conspiracy theories about Israel that claimed the country had orchestrated the Hamas terrorist attacks on 7 October.Mr Ali’s words were first put to Labour on a Saturday and broke in the evening. After Labour attempted to defend the decision not to suspend their candidate on the Sunday political shows, further accusations were put to the party on the Monday, and he was then suspended.Sir Keir said this showed that he and his party had acted quickly in comparison to Mr Sunak and the Tories.The Conservatives have withdrawn their support for Craig Williams, the former candidate for Montgomeryshire (PA Media)“I think the issue blew up on the Sunday, and [Mr Ali] was gone by the Monday,” he said. “That was a by-election, where we were drawing the only candidate in the by-election, where basically we had to concede the by-election.”Sir Keir’s comments came as Mr Williams, who has admitted placing a bet on the date of the election, defended himself after his suspension. He said he had “committed an error of judgement, not an offence” and added that he intended to clear his name.But public anger over the issue was highlighted by an opinion poll that showed increasing support for the idea that those who gambled on the election date should be barred from standing as candidates.Almost two-thirds (63 per cent) of the UK public said that candidates who placed bets on the date of the general election should not be allowed to stand, in research by Savanta conducted from 21 to 24 June, before the Conservative Party announced that it had withdrawn its support.Savanta’s research has underlined the challenges the prime minister faces, with over half (54 per cent) of Conservative voters saying that the candidates shouldn’t have been allowed to stand.It came as Scottish Secretary Alister Jack insisted that a claim he made, that he had won £2,000 betting on a July election, had been a joke.He said in a statement: “Following reports today I want to be absolutely clear I have not breached any gambling rules. I placed two unsuccessful bets on the date of the general election and one successful one.“I put two bets on in March of £5 each for an election to be held in May and June respectively. In April, I put £20 at 5 to 1 on an election being held between July and September. I had no knowledge of the date of the election until the day it was called. As I have said previously, I placed no bets in May and am not under investigation by the Gambling Commission.”Shortly after the prime minister called the election, he told the BBC he had made £2,100 after betting on June and July election dates.Rishi Sunak’s leadership is again under question (EPA)Mr Sunak had withstood days of mounting calls to suspend those caught up in the row, with Northern Ireland minister Steve Baker the latest senior Tory to call for action.In a bid to head off criticism, the prime minister announced on Monday that the Conservatives were conducting their own inquiry into the row. But a day later, the party said that “as a result of ongoing internal enquiries” it could no longer support either candidate.Mr Williams – who, as Mr Sunak’s parliamentary private secretary, was one of the prime minister’s closest aides – appeared to admit having placed a bet on the election date just days before the Tory leader announced it, saying he had made a “huge error of judgement”.Despite being ditched by their party, both Mr Williams, who is standing in Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr, and Ms Saunders, the former candidate for Bristol North West, will still appear on ballot papers, as the deadline to change these has passed.Mr Baker piled pressure on Mr Sunak on Monday when he told ITV: “I would call them up and ask them, ‘Did you do it?’ And if they did it, then they are suspended.“But the prime minister would have to answer why he hasn’t done it. I haven’t got inside information on why the prime minister hasn’t done it.”The Northern Ireland minister joined senior Tories including Tobias Ellwood, who also called for the two candidates to be suspended.After the announcement, Conservative former cabinet minister David Frost tweeted: “We get there in the end. But why did it take so long to come to a decision that seemed so necessary right from the start?”Others said to be involved in the Gambling Commission inquiry include the party’s chief data officer Nick Mason, who has taken a leave of absence from CCHQ.A close protection officer for the prime minister has also been suspended by the Metropolitan Police and is being investigated.",Keir Starmer blasts Sunak’s leadership over ‘failure to grasp the nettle’ on election betting scandal,16,9
60,"Four men have been arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass at Rishi Sunak’s constituency home, as video appears to show an intruder carrying out a dirty protest in a lake at the property.The men were detained at around 12.40pm on Tuesday before being escorted off the prime minister’s property in Kirby Sigston, North Yorkshire Police said.The force added that the men included one 52-year-old from London, one 43-year-old from Bolton, one 21-year-old from Manchester, and one 20-year-old from Chichester.They remain in police custody and inquiries are ongoing.A video has been released by protest group Youth Demand showing a young man entering the Prime Minister’s property and appearing to defecate in a lake.The group said the action was a “parting gift” for the Prime Minister and the Conservative government.In a press release, the group identified the man in the video as Oliver, 21, a student from Manchester, and included a statement from him.“We have so much to thank the Tories for: from crumbling schools, s*** in the rivers and a collapsing NHS; to creating a nation with more food banks than McDonalds and 4.3 million UK children living in poverty,” he said.“From allowing their mates to get filthy rich from selling weapons to battle-test on toddlers in Gaza, or by drilling for more oil as the world burns – it’s quite a legacy!”Youth Demand describes itself as a campaign calling for an arms embargo on Israel, as well as for the Government to revoke all new oil and gas licences granted since 2021.Earlier this year the Prime Minister condemned the group after it staged a demonstration outside the home of Labour leader Keir Starmer.The demonstrators hung a banner outside Sir Keir’s house that read: “Starmer stop the killing” surrounded by red hand prints.It is not the first time the prime minister’s home has been targeted by protesters.In August last year four Greenpeace protesters were arrested and charged with criminal damage after allegedly climbing on to the roof of Mr Sunak’s home in Kirby Sigston.His west London home was subject to a demonstration by Just Stop Oil in November last year.",Four arrests at Rishi Sunak’s house after man filmed leaving ‘parting gift’ dirty protest in his lake,15,9
118,"Labour has told its staff that nobody can take time off this weekend to go to Glastonbury even with the party holding a huge lead in the polls.An insider confirmed “there’s a three line whip” on everyone not to go to Glastonbury this year with the final week of campaignng about to begin. Even Labour’s deputy leader Angela Rayner has been forced to abandon her plans to go to the music festival with headliners Coldplay, Shania Twain, SZA and Dua Lipa.The festival which once echoed to “Oh Jeremy Corbyn” has become another symbol of “No Jeremy Corbyn” from a party which has expelled its former leader in a ruthless charge to regain power.People arriving at Glastonbury on Wednesday - but Labour staffers are not allowed (Getty Images)Instead staff who have been working day and night in Labour’s swanky offices in Southwark just south of the Thames will be redeployed to “key marginals” in the next 48 hours.“Now the manifesto is done there is less for people to do here and we need boots on the ground in target seats,” The Independent was told on a visit to the headquarters.There is some discussion over what “target seats” now means with the way the polls now suggest that constituencies which once seemed out of reach and impossible now being within reach. A sign of that was the decision by Rishi Sunak to spend more time in his Richmond and Northallerton seat in Yorkshire because of the danger of being the first sitting prime minister to lose his constituency in an election.Deputy party leader Angela Rayner had been due to attend the festival (PA)The revelation came on a visit by The Independent to the sprawling open plan office where the ruthless Labour operation has planned its election victory.Only Sir Keir Starmer has his own small office with different “departments” nestling next to one another across the expanse.The area is littered with diet coke cans, bottles of high energy power drinks and half eaten oranges in a clear sign on what has fuelled Labour’s march to power over the last few weeks.But with the policy teams work now done the floor is now emptying as they are bussed off to different parts of the UK to make sure the poll predictions of a massive victory come true.“Not many actual votes have been cast yet and we cannot take anything for granted.”There are other signs of what has helped motivate this winning team apart from the discount on drinks offer at a nearby pub.A plastic model of Liz Truss looks down on people near to the main entrance to the operation perhaps as a constant reminder of the “mini budget” that dashed Tory hopes of a revival. Ms Truss has featured on many of Labour’s campaign messages, not least the question about why Rishi sunak permitted her to be a candidate.Labour have a hope of picking up her Norfolk South West seat which seems to be vulnerable for the first time in history.But while the abiding message in the 2024 campaign has been “change” - change from Jeremy Corbyn, change for the country - there is a giant reminder of Labour’s socialist roots.A poster from the 1910 election - well before Labour was a proper national force and the two main parties with the Liberals and the Tories - dominates the room close to Sir Keir’s office.With marching workers it proclaims: “Forward! The day is breaking”.Campaign manager Morgan McSweeney can be seen pacing around nervously but there is an air of confidence in the room that after 14 years of irrelevance Labour is back and about to seize power again.A room filled with light and determination seems to reflect the end of a long dark chapter in Labour history.

252,"Sir Keir Starmer and his Labour team enjoy warm cuddly feelings about the European Union. Although Starmer has ruled out returning to the customs union or the EU’s single market, Labour says that it will improve the UK’s relationship with the EU by negotiating a veterinary agreement to reduce border checks and seeking mutual recognition agreements allowing touring artists and professionals to export their services to the EU.But what is equally clear is that Labour’s feelings about the EU are not reciprocated. Labour’s overtures were met with a brutal put-down from EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier. He warned that the EU will block Labour’s plan to improve the terms of Brexit as “cherry picking”, unless the UK accepts the full obligations of the single market, including free movement of workers. Barnier’s intervention highlights a truth which is apparent to everyone, except, for some reason, to those who still hanker for a step by step return to EU membership. The EU is not interested in improving trade with its neighbours as an end in itself. What it wants is to use trade terms as a carrot and stick to force its neighbours into following product standards and rules dictated by Brussels.The EU has achieved near total compliance with its single market rules by the EEA countries Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Switzerland has put up more of a fight against the EU’s attempts to impose control on it, but still has to follow EU rules in many areas and to accept the free movement of workers.This is what makes negotiating about trade with the EU much more difficult and dangerous than negotiating with other trading partners around the world. They will agree to things like mutual recognition if they think it makes trading sense from their point of view, for example by allowing their professionals to export their services into the UK market in return for giving access to professionals from the UK.But the EU will also demand control over the UK’s own rules as part of the price of this kind of arrangement. In return for mutual recognition of professional qualifications, it will demand that UK professions comply with the rules laid down in the EU’s own directives. In return for a seemingly innocuous veterinary agreement to ease border checks on meat, it will demand that the UK comply with the whole panoply of the EU’s own ossified veterinary medicines law.Most worryingly, Rachel Reeve has suggested that Labour would seek mutual recognition for bankers and financial services workers, which would open the door to Brussels reimposing some of its anti-competitive rules from which the City has only just been freed.Aligning with EU rules over which we have no control is extremely damaging. We have no vote on future changes to them, which will be made in the EU’s interests and not in ours. This negates democracy and our right to control our own laws. It prevents us from innovating and improving the competitiveness of our economy, and can also interfere with our trade deals around the world with other countries who regard many Brussels rules as protectionist barriers against their own exports.Starmer’s and Reeve’s comments about trying to negotiate with the EU to improve the terms of Brexit reveal their naivety about the EU and its objectives. Their attempt will either fail altogether in the face of the EU’s demands – probably the most likely outcome – but if they do a deal, it is likely to involve a very heavy price in loss of independence and control in return for modest trade benefits.But Labour would only be following more overtly and enthusiastically a route already embarked on surreptitiously by Rishi Sunak and his government. Last year he abandoned Liz Truss’s Northern Ireland Protocol Bill which had been passed by the House of Commons and would have solved the problem of EU laws applying in Northern Ireland. Instead he agreed the so-called Windsor Framework, which entrenched the EU’s control over all laws relating to goods in Northern Ireland, in return for some narrow and limited easings on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.It is not only Northern Ireland which is affected. Jeremy Hunt was unable to increase the VAT registration threshold for the whole of the UK by more than a paltry £5000, because of the EU’s VAT rules which apply in Northern Ireland. And as part of the government’s deal to get the DUP back into power sharing, it agreed to limit divergences between the rules relating to goods in Great Britain and EU rules, in order to avoid further barriers to trade across the Irish Sea inside the United Kingdom.Of course, there is nothing wrong with preventing barriers to trade inside the UK, but this should be done by freeing Northern Ireland from EU rules, not by shadowing EU rules across the whole of the UK.So the choice is between Labour which enthuses about easing trade with the EU, an innocuous objective in its own right, but is naïvely willing to cede hard-won control over our laws back to the EU. The Conservatives, whose record over the past two years is one of tying the UK deeper into aligning with EU laws, despite their protestations of delivering Brexit. Reform which promises to axe all remaining EU laws and scrap the Windsor Framework. Or of course the Liberal Democrats, who have a longer term objective of returning to EU membership.",Keir Starmer is about to kill the Brexit dream for good,16,11

331,"The green belt around Hitchin has rarely looked greener. A chlorophyll-friendly cycle of pouring rain and blazing sunshine has left the landscapes of this Hertfordshire-Bedfordshire constituency throbbing with midsummer life.But these open fields and stands of oak are at the heart of the issue vexing so many voters here in this general election: how to crack the housing crisis.Hitchin, a mostly rural constituency 35 minutes by rail from central London and newly formed from three previously Conservative seats, is under huge housing pressure. The green belt is being eyed up not just by developers but political parties, too.Private rents are up 36% since the last general election five years ago, according to Zoopla. House prices are up 13% despite interest rate rises. If Labour and the Conservatives are to meet their respective pledges to build 1.5m and 1.6m new homes in the next parliament, then constituencies such as Hitchin will need to find room.But already pressures are high. Thousands of people have moved from London since the pandemic pricing out local young people. Many alighted on the historic town of Hitchin, which now has 60 places to buy coffee and, since last September, a branch of the gift and lifestyle store Oliver Bonas – a sure sign that plenty of residents have a healthy disposable income.Canvassing in one of the town wards this month, Alistair Strathern, the Labour candidate, spoke to seven households in one street who had recently arrived from north-east London – three from the same borough of Waltham Forest.There’s a Brick Lane Bagel stall and a shop selling puppucinos (that’s cappuccinos for dogs). On the town square, the jewellers Gatwards might have seen sales of £1,000 pieces fall amid the cost of living crisis – but big ticket purchases over £10,000 are up. The owner is having a refurb to install a bar to cater to the high-rollers.“The local population has to compete with the effect of gentrification caused by people moving here from London,” said Jack Taylor, 31, a charity director who is among the many struggling to buy. “Everyone born in Hitchin or Stevenage is moving farther afield as they just can’t afford it.”Voters also get frustrated about congested roads, patchy rail services, overwhelmed GPs and stretched schools. A place that was a pressure valve for London’s housing crisis is itself starting to boil over.In common with much of England, housebuilding has been slowing down in recent decades. In North Hertfordshire district it has almost halved in the 15 years since the global financial crisis. The average waiting time for a three-bed house for social rent in Hitchin is now nearly four years.The London arrivals have also changed the social mix. Selling paper plates at the outdoor market, John Haykin, a Hitchin resident of 45 years, said the town had “lost a lot of community in the last five to 10 years”.Music and food festivals in the town have an atmosphere “like a London borough”, said Tom Hardy, 34, the town centre manager.But as the candidates – Strathern for Labour, Bim Afolami for the Conservatives and Chris Lucas for the Liberal Democrats – canvass in a tight race, few voters trust they have the answer.Dave, 36, an insurance worker, moved to Hitchin from London so he could afford to buy a £200,000 one-bed flat. Now he wants to move in with his partner and the cost of a two-bed flat here means they must consider moving farther afield again.“I can’t see any political party getting to grips with the housing crisis,” he said. “It seems to have a force behind it that normal politics won’t be able to stop.”One answer could be to concrete over more fields. But after decades of identikit estates being built on farmland by volume housebuilders, opposition to “sprawl” is widespread.On the western boundary of the constituency, North Hertfordshire district council has agreed to remove enough land from the green belt to build 2,100 homes. This Luton overspill will surround a cluster of historic rural villages, woodland, bridleways and hiking paths – what the villagers call their “green lung”.Interactive“Rishi [Sunak] has said [he’ll protect the green belt], [Micheal] Gove has said it, but they don’t do it,” said Dave Harris, a villager. “This is a classic example. This whole process has made me despondent about UK politics.”If it wins next week, Labour is promising to speed up planning and to take chunks out of the grey belt (environmentally poor green belt). But the mood in Hitchin suggests Keir Starmer would be wise not to ignore the risk of another shires rebellion of the kind that thwarted Boris Johnson’s 2021 attempts to ease planning controls.On the eastern constituency border, there is disquiet where a 700-home estate is planned at Highover Farm. It will move the boundary of Hitchin town to within a few hundred metres of nearby Letchworth.“You might as well build a cathedral and call it a city,” said Liz, 63, a nurse who lives next door to the planned estate. She fears the family homes won’t help the young people priced out of Hitchin or those in need of social housing and will be sold to people out of the area.Trust that new housing developments will be accompanied by better roads, enough schools and GP surgeries is shot.The Priory school, the town’s 1,200-pupil comprehensive, is already losing three teachers this year who won’t be replaced and some classes have up to 32 pupils, says the headteacher, Geraint Edwards.Special educational needs provision in the area is under huge pressure. And then there is the constant headache of the service on the rail link to London, with almost a third of trains operated by Govia Thameslink running late.Labour’s big idea is new towns, which, if delivered, would be the first since the 1970s. The idea has support in Hitchin, not least as Ebenezer Howard’s original 1903 garden city of Letchworth lies just over the constituency border. The policy at least holds out the promise of confined rather than sprawling housebuilding.But the hard question is where? Asked in between door knocks if he would accept a new town in the constituency, Strathern said only that his party would “come forward with a really sensible framework for engaging communities, not just here, but right across the country, on where the best places for new towns would be”.InteractiveAfolami, the Conservative candidate and Treasury minister who held the now defunct Hitchin and Harpenden seat, said voters were right to be “really unhappy with how poorly managed, in terms of local infrastructure, the housing has been”. This was an “indictment of how the council have done things” but he conceded it was also legitimate to “criticise the Conservative government over the last 13 years for not wielding a heavier stick on how councils and developers interact and making sure the infrastructure comes in first”.New towns, he said, were “obviously a good idea” but “the difficulty is where they go”.And to complete the noncommittal picture, the Lib Dem candidate, Lucas, was supportive “in principle” but said: “You can’t just magic up a place for new towns.”No one seems to want to grasp the nettle before polling day.And even when new houses are built, there are problems. Strathern has been campaigning on the Campton Fields estate, built recently in the north of the constituency. Freeholders have been dismayed at facing a combined £34,000 annual charges from private firms to manage the roads, pavements and play areas because they have not been adopted yet by the council. Weeds sprout from the pavements. It is a bizarre situation that Strathern calls “fleecehold”.But building is not the only solution. At Letchworth Citizens Advice, a renter named Stuart, 35, could be found pleading for emergency cash for food after falling £3,400 in rent arrears.His debts were caused by zero-hours contracts in warehouses and manufacturing companies. Employers keep laying him off after a few months so he doesn’t accrue employment rights, leading to periods without wages.The number of people with housing problems seeking help at the bureau is up 62% on last year. Insecure work is a common issue.defaultIn this relatively affluent constituency with higher than average levels of employment, wages and higher education, you hear concerns about Labour’s “vindictive” plan to levy VAT on private schools. There are calls for more defence spending than Labour is offering. Sample responses to Starmer include: “not strong enough”, “a good man”, “a nothing person”. It could be close on 4 July.Taken overall, the mood is one of antipathy towards the Conservatives but only lukewarm enthusiasm for Labour. Whoever wins will find much to do in Hitchin.",‘Normal politics won’t stop it’: housing crisis dominates election in Hitchin,16,8

I mean, I’m sympathetic to some of the points they made. You know, I think in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs we’re doing a lot to lower our carbon footprint and improve the environment.”Mr Spencer said the criticism of the Tories’ record on the environment was not “fair at all”.“We’ve made huge strides in making sure that we are both energy secure but lowering our carbon footprint as as a nation.”Starmer: ‘David Tennant should have been respectful in criticising Badenoch'15:50 , Salma OuaguiraSir Keir Starmer has said Doctor Who actor David Tennant should have been more respectful when he criticised Kemi Badenoch in his British LGBT awards.After accepting the LGBT ally award, the Hollywood actor said: “We shouldn’t live in a world where that is worth remarking on. However, until we wake up and Kemi Badenoch doesn’t exist any more – I don’t wish ill of her, I just wish her to shut up – whilst we do live in this world, I am honoured to receive this.”Reacting to the remarks, the Labour leader said disagreement “is important” but Mr Tennant should have been more careful.Keir Starmer added “I think in politics, as in life, it’s really important that we are able to robustly disagree with others.“Obviously, that happens a lot in the general election campaign, but we should do it with respect for everybody involved in that robust discussion.“I wouldn’t have engaged in the way that he did.

190,"Rishi Sunak has been accused of eroding the public’s trust in politics by failing to order investigations into more than a dozen potential breaches of strict ethics rules during his time as prime minister.The Liberal Democrats say he presided over 17 possible violations of the ministerial code in 18 months, none of which were referred to his ethics adviser.The accusation comes as the Conservative’s election campaign is embroiled in a betting scandal.The Westminster gambling row deepened late on Tuesday when a cabinet minister revealed he had placed bets on the date of the general election.Scotland secretary Alister Jack denied he had broken any rules, but said he put three wagers on the timing of the July 4 poll, becoming the latest of seven politicians and officials to be drawn in to the controversy.Earlier Sir Keir Starmer took aim at Rishi Sunak’s leadership ability over the betting scandal, accusing the prime minister of “failing to grasp the nettle” and take action quickly enough.Rishi Sunak at a Conservative general election campaign event in EdinburghDaisy Cooper, the deputy leader of the Lib Dems, who compiled the list, accused the Tory government of being “besieged by sleaze”.“Their brazen disregard for the rules has torn up standards in public life and eroded trust in our political system,” she said.And she said Mr Sunak had “proven himself too weak to take any action on the slew of Conservative scandals under his leadership”.The Lib Dems say they would stamp out sleaze by enshrining the ministerial code in law and make the government’s ethics adviser fully independent, a move they say would stop ministers “marking their own homework”.Cases cited by the Lib Dems include Rishi Sunak’s wife’s shares in a childcare company which could have benefited from a government scheme.The party also pointed to cabinet minister Michelle Donelan’s use of £34,000 of taxpayers’ money to cover libel damages.And that no action was taken over allegations against  Mark Menzies, who disputes claims he used thousands of pounds of party funds to pay off people who had locked him in a flat, before the story hit the headlines.Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has admitted he made bets - but denied wrongdoing (PA Wire)The Libs Dems say cases which warranted an investigation occurred almost once a month since the appointment of Mr Sunak’s Ethics Adviser in December 2022.One of his predecessors, Boris Johnson, lost an ethics adviser in 2020 when Sir Alex Allan quit after he was overruled over a report into alleged bullying by the home secretary Priti Patel.The Lib Dems say other potential breaches of the ministerial code included Nadhim Zahawi’s legal threats to campaigners and journalists, including this newspaper, over his tax affairs.Ms Cooper said that the Conservatives had been “besieged by sleaze” and that her party’s plans would “end the cycle of scandals”.The Conservatives have been approached for comment.",Rishi Sunak accused of failing to order probe into 17 potential breaches of ministerial code,16,9
24,"A voter asked Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer directly whether they are “really the best we’ve got” at last night’s election debate – eliciting an eruption of applause from the audience.Sunak and Starmer traded furious blows on Wednesday night in a live BBC head-to-head election debate.The Labour and Conservative leaders attacked each another over migration, tax, and Brexit as they took questions from a live audience in Nottingham.However, it was a question on the rivals’ personal qualities that drew the loudest round of applause.Robert Blackstock asked: “Are you two really the best we’ve got to be the next prime minister of our great country?”Robert Blackstock fiercely criticised both party leaders (BBC)The voter began by saying he thought Sunak had made “a fair job of being chancellor but you’re a pretty mediocre prime minister” and that Starmer was having his “strings are being pulled by very senior members of the Labour party”.The crowd was animated as people were seen gasping and a huge round of applause began.Audience members smiled and raised their eyebrows as Blackstock asked the question (BBC)Starmer said he was not surprised by the question, after 14 years of Tory rule leaving the country “in such a state”.“They’ve had loads of promises made in the last election about what will happen which haven’t been delivered on. That does beat the hope out of people,” he said.“So, this is an opportunity to restore that hope. I don’t think we can do that by making sort of grand promises of things that can’t be delivered.”Sunak responded by listing what he thinks are the Conservatives’ best achievements during his time in Downing Street.Both Sunak and Starmer looked sheepish as the audience applauded the question (BBC)He urged the audience: “Allow me to finish the job I started.”However, when interviewed after the debate, Blackstock said the two candidates did not provide sufficient answers on why they are good enough for the job.“I was disappointed with the response from both Rishi and Sir Keir. Neither of them wanted to say why they were good,” he said.“They were going by what they’ve done in the past. They weren’t being positive. For a prime minister, from my perspective, we want a personality. We want somebody we can recognise. We want somebody on the world stage that is going to project our Great Britain.”",‘Are you two really the best we’ve got?’: Election summed up with excruciating question to Sunak and Starmer,17,9

He is defending a 6,242 majority in the West Yorkshire seat. Sir Phillip has denied doing anything illegal, and it is not believed he is under investigation.First uncovered two weeks ago, the scandal began when it was revealed now-suspended Conservative candidate Craig Williams placed a bet of £100 on the election taking place in July, just 3 days before Sunak announced the date in May.Several people with ties to the Conservatives have subsequently been placed under investigation for allegedly placing similar bets on when the general election would take place.Responding to the discovery, Mr Williams said: “I put a flutter on the general election some weeks ago. This has resulted in some routine inquiries and I confirm I will fully cooperate with these.”Tory betting scandal: Tony Lee, Chris Williams, Alister Jack, Rishi Sunak, Laura Saunders, Russell George (Getty/PA/Supplied)“I don’t want it to be a distraction from the campaign, I should have thought how it looks.”He was suspended nearly two weeks later alongside fellow Tory candidate Laura Saunders. The move drew criticism from many opposition and Conservative MPs alike, who said the prime minister was too slow too act.Speaking to The Independent, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer slammed the prime minister for his handling of the scandal: “If they had been my candidates, they’d have been straight out of the door and their feet wouldn’t have touched the floor”“But to wait a week, to make excuses like that, is inexcusable.”Amongst the six Metropolitan police officers being investigated, one has been arrested – a member of Mr Sunak’s close protection team. The Met has also denied being the source of names under investigation leaked to press, calling the speculation “a poor distraction technique.”The Gambling Commission has now expanded its investigation to look at hundreds of suspicious bets in the run up to the general election.“These investigations are ongoing … one of them is a criminal investigation that’s being conducted by the police,” the prime minister told the BBC Question Time Leaders Special general election debate.“What I can tell you is if anyone is found to have broken the rules, not only should they face the full consequences of the law, I will make sure that they are booted out of the Conservative Party.”Who is involved in the betting scandal?Craig WilliamsCraig Williams, the PM’s closest parliamentary aide, was the first person caught up in the scandal. He admitted placing a bet on the election prior to Mr Sunak’s announcement after he was approached by a journalist.The 39-year-old Tory candidate for Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr placed a £100 bet with 5-1 odds at Ladbrokes, meaning he would have won £500, but his name was raised as potentially a “politically exposed person”, so the wager was not registered.Former MP Craig Williams (UK Parliament)That sparked the Gambling Commission writing to firms demanding the details of all bets made on a July election after 1 May, which it is now combing through. It is now believed to have widened its search beyond MPs and candidates to their friends and relatives as well.Bookmakers are particularly cautious over “novelty” betting markets such as the general election.According to The Guardian, which first reported the story, Mr Williams placed his bet via an online account that would have required him to provide personal details, including his date of birth and debit card. The bookmaker also knows the location of the bet.Ladbrokes declined to comment on the incident but the Gambling Commission issued a statement confirming that it was investigating.Mr Williams apologised after admiting that he had placed a wager on the bet, but refused to comment further while the GC carried out its probe.“I clearly made a huge error of judgment, that’s for sure, and I apologise,” he told. “I will not be expanding on my statement because it’s an independent process.”Laura SaundersLaura Saunders was the second person to be named in the affair.Tory candidate for Bristol North West, Ms Saunders is also under investigation by the Gambling Commission over claims she may have had inside knowledge about the prime minister’s decision to call a snap poll for 4 July. She has worked for the party since 2015.Laura Saunders and Tony Lee pictured together (Supplied)According to the BBC, which first named Ms Saunders as the candidate under investigation, she worked most recently at the party’s international division at Conservative Campaign Headquarters, which works with other centre-right parties around the world.Tony LeeTony Lee, husband of Ms Saunders, has also been implicated in the scandal. He is the Conservative Party’s director of campaigning, having worked on former West Midlands mayor Andy Street’s successful 2021 campaign.Mr Lee stepped back from his position on June 19 following reports that he was also under investigation by the Gambling Commission alongside his wife.Nick MasonNick Mason became the Tory chief data officer after unsuccessfully running for the party for Jarrow in Tyneside in the 2015. He was named by The Sunday Times as the fourth person to be investigated by the Gambling Commission.Mr Mason is alleged to have placed dozens of bets over an unknown period, with winnings which would total thousands of pounds. He has also taken a leave of absence from his position. A spokeperson for Mr Mason has declined to comment but denies wrong doing.Russell GeorgeRussell George is a Tory member of Welsh parliament, representing the same constituency as Mr Williams. It was revealed by The Guardian on June 25 that he was under investigation by the gambling watchdog.Welsh Conservatives leader Andrew RT Davies said: “Russell George has informed me that he has received a letter from the Gambling Commission regarding bets on the timing of the general election.“Russell George has stepped back from the Welsh Conservative shadow cabinet while these investigations are ongoing.”He says that all other Conservative members of the Senedd have denied placing any bets.Kevin CraigBringing the scandal to the Labour party, now-suspended candidate Kevin Craig was also confirmed to be under investigation by the gambling watchdog on June 25Running in Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, Mr Craig had bet on himself to lose the seat on July 4. The seat was won by the Conservatives with a majority of just over 20,000 in 2019.Former Labour candidate Kevin Craig (YouTube)Releasing a statement on social media, Mr Craig said he had made a “stupid error,” adding that he intended to give his winnings to charity.“This was a huge mistake, for which I apologise unreservedly,” he said.“I have so much respect for how Keir Starmer has changed the Labour Party and I have been fighting so hard to win this seat and change the country alongside him.“However, it is right that the party upholds the highest standards for its Parliamentary candidates - just as the public expects the highest standards from any party hoping to serve in government.”Alister JackConservative cabinet minister Alister Jack admitted to placing three bets on the date of the general election on June 25, saying he had made £2,100 from one of them. He later claimed his comments were “a joke”.The minister for Scotland then backtracked, admitting that he had placed several bets before May. In April, Mr Jack says he placed a successful bet that the election would fall between July and September, after losing two similar bets made in March.Scotland minister Alister Jack (Michal Wachucik/PA) (PA Wire)Mr Jack has denied wrongdoing in a statement: “I had no knowledge of the date of the election until the day it was called.“I placed no bets in May and am not under investigation by the Gambling Commission.”Sir Phillip DaviesSir Phillip Davies has been the Conservative MP for Shipley, West Yorkshire since 2005 and is married to cabinet minister Esther McVey. He is currently the most rebellious serving Tory MP, having voted against the government over 250 times.On June 26, it was revealed that Sir Phillip had even rebelled against himself, placing an £8,000 bet to lose the seat he has held for nearly 20 years.“I hope to win. I’m busting a gut to win. I expect to lose. In the 2005 election, I busted a gut to win. I expected to lose,” the MP told The Sun.“I had a bet on myself to lose in the 2005 election, and my bet went down the pan.”“It’s nobody’s business apart from mine,” Sir Phillip said, adding that he had not done anything illegal. It is not believed that he is under investigation by the Gambling Commission.A police officer in Rishi Sunak’s close protection teamA police officer in Mr Sunak’s close protection team was arrested and suspended over alleged bets about the timing of the general election.The police constable from the Met’s Royalty and Specialist Protection Command was arrested on 17 June on suspicion of misconduct in public office after the betting watchdog contacted the force last Friday.The officer was taken into custody and bailed pending further enquiries, with the case being referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, according to the Met. The force has confirmed is serving on restricted duties.Five more police officersOn June 25, the Met confirmed that they had been informed of five more police officers placed under investigation by the Gambling Commission.In a statement, the London police force said: “The officers are based on the Royalty and Specialist Command, the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command and the Central West Basic Command Unit. None of them work in a close protection role.“Decisions on whether they will be subject to any restrictions will be taken in due course.”What are the rules for MPs and others on betting with inside knowledge?Using confidential information to gain an unfair advantage when betting may constitute a criminal offence. Gamblers are not allowed to use inside information to place a bet or to instruct someone else to do so on their behalf.They are also not allowed to pass inside information on to someone else which they use for betting.Additionally, the MPs’ code of conduct bars members from “causing significant damage to the reputation and integrity of the house”.

75,"In general elections, constituencies where the local result has a habit of matching the overall national outcome are known as “bellwethers”.They are seats that have a pattern of changing hands only when the government itself changes hands.A handful of constituencies have been bellwethers for decades, and as such are watched closely for what they may – or may not – suggest about the outcome of the entire election.The seat with the longest track record of being a bellwether is Dartford in Kent.Since 1964, whichever party wins Dartford has also gone on to form the government.At this election, Conservative candidate Gareth Johnson is defending a notional majority in Dartford of 14,704.(PA Graphics)This is described as a notional majority because it is what Mr Johnson is likely to have won in 2019 had that contest taken place using the new constituency boundaries that have been introduced across the UK for the 2024 election.For Dartford to change hands on July 4, there would have to be a direct swing to Labour in the share of the vote of 15.9 percentage points.This is the equivalent of a net change of 16 in every 100 people who voted Conservative last time switching sides.It is large enough to rank Dartford at number 185 on Labour’s list of targets, based on the size of swing it needs to gain seats from other parties.Elsewhere, three seats have been bellwethers at every general election since February 1974: Loughborough, Northampton North and Watford.All three are top Labour targets at this election, and the Tories would lose them to Sir Keir Starmer’s party on swings of 5.9 percentage points, 3.9 points and 1.4 points respectively.Watford ranks at number nine on Labour’s target list, while Northampton North is 38th and Loughborough is 61st.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer with student nurses during an early campaign stop in Worcester last month (PA)Worcester has been a bellwether since 1979.At the 1997 general election, attracting the support of the so-called “Worcester woman” was considered by Labour to be vital for victory nationwide.At this election, Labour needs a swing of 6.7 points to take Worcester from the Conservatives, ranking it at number 70 on the party’s target list.Sir Keir held two campaign events in Worcester soon after the election was called.Two other seats have been bellwethers since 1979: Harrow East and Gloucester.Harrow East in north London would need a swing of 8.6 percentage points for Labour to gain it from the Conservatives, while Gloucester would need one of 9.7 points.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has twice visited Harrow East since the start of the election campaign.",What are the 'bellwether' seats at the General Election?What are the 'bellwether' seats at the General Election?,17,4
294,"The BBC general election debate on Wednesday saw Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer go head to head for the last time before the country goes to the polls.In our writers’ verdict following the debate, Tim Stanley, Telegraph columnist, argued Rishi Sunak “sounded like an effective Leader of the Opposition”, while Tom Harris, former Labour MP, said “the Prime Minister yet again missed a golden opportunity.”Telegraph readers were eager to give their verdict. In a snap poll, 79 per cent of over 51,000 readers voted that Rishi Sunak came out on top.The majority of readers sided firmly with the Prime Minister, who many thought “thrashed” the Labour leader on every issue, so much so that they reconsidered their support for Reform.“Wow, what a performance by Sunak – he ran rings around Starmer,” reader Gill B. began.Although they have been “a huge critic of Sunak since he called the election,” they concluded that “Starmer is not PM material and Labour are not fit for government.”Edna Clouds was a “full bore” Reform supporter – up until the debate. She now believes that “pressure is having a real impact on the Tories.”“Rishi Sunak was impressive tonight,” Edna said, “He’s finally sounding like a true blue. He’s thrashed Keir Starmer on every single issue.”Similarly, David B. shared that he has been a loyal Conservative for 40 years and although he considered Reform, “seeing Keir Starmer tonight, I’m voting Conservative. There’s no way this bloke should be running the country.”Meanwhile, pro-Palestinian protestors outside the venue in Nottingham Trent University could be heard throughout the debate, much to readers’ dismay who thought it was “hindering the discussion meant to progress the democratic process.”Bob Davis wrote: “This was clearly the wrong venue, the protesters outside are intimidating the democratic process.“Who in their right mind would use a university as a venue for a debate? Universities are wastelands for freedom of debate.”‘How can this man get into No 10?’Readers branded Sir Keir Starmer the weaker debater of the two, and were particularly disappointed by his responses to questions on immigration and tax.Reader Cymon Barton Jones thought “Starmer showed himself tonight. Not a single answer to any questions, nothing specific, no details, no plan. How can this man get into No 10?”And Roscoe P Coltrane said: “Keir Starmer looks incredibly weak on the small boats’ crisis, I thought I saw lips quivering!“I’ve got no time for Rishi Sunak, but I think he’s undoubtedly the much stronger debater.”Likewise, Ian Dodd argued: “Keir Starmer has been exposed regarding his lack of migration policy and his tax increases. He says he runs big departments, but he did nothing about grooming gangs.”Reader A.B. reasoned: “Keir Starmer might just be a fairly quiet, principled man. What these debates illustrate to me, though, is that he doesn’t have the charismatic aura to lead and command loyalty. Factions with big characters will go after him... he’ll be overpowered.”“As a Labour supporter, thank goodness Keir Starmer didn’t do any more of these [debates],” Ed Jones said, adding: “It’s not his strength at all. Strange really, because as a lawyer you would think he could fight his corner better. Rishi Sunak is all over him.”‘Rishi Sunak was incessantly talking over everyone’Some readers criticised Rishi Sunak for repeating himself and talking over Sir Keir and the BBC’s moderator Mishal Husain during the debate.Paul Hassall suggested: “Sunak is like a parrot churning the same old rubbish every time. He just shouts people down!”In a similar vein, Richard Evans thought “Rishi Sunak was incessantly talking over everyone.” Mishal Hussain “just let him speak uninterrupted over Keir Starmer. No dignity, no manners.”And L.C. Gills believed Rishi Sunak was “all words and no action, same as always.”However, W.H. countered: “Rishi Sunak gives the impression of a man who has a clear view going forward. Keir Starmer, on the other hand, is in too many minority groups – he will always be pulled in a million directions and will never have clear convictions.”",BBC election debate verdict: ‘Rishi Sunak is finally sounding like a true blue’,17,11
388,"​​​​​​​The final TV clash of the election campaign was an ill-tempered shouting match, at least from Rishi Sunak. Sir Keir was more measured. More prime ministerial, perhaps?As he had to as the underdog, Mr Sunak went on the attack from the start until the very end and unveiled a new campaign slogan: ""Don't surrender…""He said it no fewer than 15 times during the 75-minute debate. That's once every five minutes.But just like the England-Slovenia Euros match 24 hours earlier, the result was a draw, 50%-50% exactly, according to pollsters YouGov.Election latest: PM 'behaved badly' in debate with Sir KeirAnd, some would say, that just like the England game, it was a 0-0 draw really.At the outset, the PM served notice he wanted to talk about tax, while Sir Keir wanted to talk about politicians gambling. Hardly surprising.As Mr Sunak read out prepared lines - and appeared to be looking down at notes - it was a smart ad lib from Sir Keir that won the first round of applause.Read more:Greenpeace protester climbs on Tory election campaign busWhere is Liz Truss? ""If you listened to people in the audience more you might not be so out of touch,"" he said, in a familiar Labour attack line.But the PM was strong and came out on top in exchanges on illegal migrants crossing the channel.""Don't surrender our borders to the Labour Party,"" he urged the audience in the first of many ""Don't surrender…"" appeals to voters.Then he challenged Sir Keir on illegal migrants: ""What will you do with them?"" And then came a good ad lib - or perhaps prepared line of attack - from the PM.""Are you going to sit down with the ayatollahs? Are you going to sit down with the Taliban?"" he goaded Sir Keir, winning applause this time.The host Mishal Husain had a good line too. When the Labour leader attacked Mr Sunak for saying: ""We should unite behind Liz Truss.""""You know what it's like to fall in behind the leader of your party!"" in a clear reference to Sir Keir's backing for Jeremy Corbyn, which gave him some uncomfortable moments in earlier TV clashes during the election campaign.Surprisingly, Mr Sunak didn't respond to that. On this occasion, a bit like the England football team, he missed an open goal.One of the best moments came when a member of the audience, Robert, asked a devastating question.He said Mr Sunak ""was a good chancellor but is a mediocre PM"" and ""Sir Keir's strings are being pulled by others in the Labour Party"".And then came this killer question from Robert: ""Are you two really the best we've got to be the next prime minister of our great country?""There were gasps from the audience and applause at the same time. Great question.Another good question from the audience came when Judy told how her jazz vinyl records business had lost 90% of its trade with Europe since Brexit. What could be done to get a better trading deal, she asked.Mr Sunak, however, dodged that question by talking about business rates and other UK taxes.On Brexit, it seemed, the PM was like a cracked record.He claimed Sir Keir's plans for better deals with the EU would mean more migration.But Sir Keir said Mr Sunak was the most liberal prime minister on migration. ""The numbers have gone through the roof,"" he said.The debate ended as it began, with Mr Sunak shouting over Sir Keir. It wasn't a good look.In the closing speeches, the PM hammered home the Tories' £2,000 Labour tax grab charge, yet again. And yet again he said: ""Don't surrender…""And as the debate ended there was no handshake between the pair, which is unusual for these TV clashes.At least party leaders pretend to be civilised towards each other usually.There's clearly no love lost between these two. It showed. A 50%-50% draw, said YouGov. Just like England at the Euros!",Just like England at the Euros - Sunak and Starmer's final TV debate was a draw,17,5
98,"Junior doctors claim to have held positive talks with Labour over a 35 per cent multi-year pay deal but will still strike for five days ahead of the general election.Union leaders said they had met with Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, multiple times, and that his vision to restore doctors’ pay “matches” their own.Despite the optimism of striking a deal with a Labour government, junior doctors will still take to the picket line to hold Rishi Sunak “accountable” because he “needs to own his mistakes and reflect on his inaction”.British Medical Association (BMA) leaders said they had an “open dialogue” with Mr Streeting and Labour and that the party were willing to “engage in constructive and meaningful talks”.Dr Rob Laurenson, GP and co-chairman of the BMA junior doctor committee said: “[Mr Streeting] is talking about things like ‘journey, not an event’. We’re happy to have a multi-year pay deal.“He has seemingly heard that and, ‘journey not an event’, matches that. The problem with the current talks is that there’s no recognition of being able to deliver a long term plan,” he said.Ending the 20-month long dispute with junior doctors would be a significant achievement for an incoming Labour government.Previously the medics had threatened to cripple the NHS once again this winter if their 35 per cent pay demands were not met.The BMA will walk out for five days from 7am on Thursday until 7am on July 2.Dr Laurenson said Mr Streeting had also understood calls to improve rotational training, which require doctors to move around the country at short notice and has “inbuilt inefficiencies”.“Streeting is the only one who has actually picked up how much of a win in terms of efficiency savings and cost savings that could be for everyone involved,” he said.Dr Vivek Trivedi, a trainee anaesthetist and BMA co-chairman, said that “the discussions [with Labour] have always been trying to keep an open dialogue and that’s been reflected in things that he’s said publicly”.“The main thing that I’ve taken away from discussions is that there does seem like there is a willingness to try and at least engage in constructive and meaningful talks.”The leaders do not regret staging their 11th round of strikes in 15 months on the eve of the general election, with the NHS also warning of “major disruption” to services amid Britain’s hottest days of the year and a cyber attack adding “operational pressure” to London hospitals.Asked why they could not wait until a new government was formed on July 5 before striking again, Dr Laurenson said: “This is what accountability looks like. He [Mr Sunak] needs to own his mistakes, and he needs to reflect on his inaction.”Dr Trivedi added that it could have been a “mutual win” for the medics and the Prime Minister.“We were hoping that this would allow him to see how this could be a mutual win for us both. He’s been talking about trying to get down the waiting list and restoring the country,” he said. “This would have been a clear indication that those words have some substance behind it. It was an opportunity for him to deliver it for the country.”Prof Phil Banfield, the BMA chairman, said he too had met Mr Streeting and Labour officials “several times over the last two years”.“We haven’t always agreed. We’ve had disagreements. We’ve suggested things, they’ve changed their stance on various bits,” he said, adding that he expects those conversations to take place.“It’ll be a tough conversation, but actually being in the room with someone is easier because you can then talk to them about your point of view.”Mr Streeting has admitted that resolving the junior doctor strikes with a pay rise was likely to be one of the first areas that will see Labour stretch its spending beyond existing commitments.“This dispute has meant over a million operations appointments and procedures being delayed or cancelled and it has cost the taxpayer £3 billion pounds –  that is a hell of a lot of money to pay for failure,” he told The Telegraph.“So it is in our interest to cut a deal and we’re going to have to look at what we can do as far as the books allow.”He said he had made clear to the BMA that their demands for a 35 per cent pay rise were “not something that the country could afford”, but that the union had shown “a willingness to negotiate down from 35 per cent to recognise that pay restoration is a journey, not an event.”“I think we can find a deal in that space,” he said.",Junior doctors hold positive talks with Labour but will still strike ahead of general election,17,11

It is now looking ever-more likely that Sir Keir Starmer will be prime minister by next Friday.Nigel Farage may yet have a good election night as Reform UK are currently in third place in the polls. The polling for the party has slipped following the controversy over Farage’s comments about the war in Ukraine but the party is still some five percentage points ahead of the Lib Dems.Yahoo News UK summaries the positions of the parties the five polls.No major changes show Labour on course for large victoryA poll by Savanta puts Labour on 42% – 21 points ahead of the Tories, who are on 21%. Ipsos also puts Labour on 42%, compared to 19% for the Tories, while JL Partners give similar results, with Labour on 41% and the Tories on 25%.A Verian poll shows Labour on 38%, with the Tories on 21%, while Survation show Labour on 41%, compared to a historic low of 18% for the Tories.An average of opinion polls from February to June this year.

The poll suggested Labour would secure 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.The YouGov poll for Sky News.A More In Common UK poll for the News Agents podcast showed Labour projecting to finish on 406 seats, with the Conservatives on 155.Meanwhile, polling by Savanta and Electoral Calculus for the Telegraph, showed Sunak could become the first sitting prime minister to lose his seat of Richmond and Northallerton to Labour. It put Labour on 516 seats, with the Tories on just 53.What are the latest odds?As of 26 June, Oddschecker – a website which compares odds across different bookmakers – had Labour at 1/41 to win the most seats. To put that in context, this is seen as so likely that a £10 bet would return just £10.24.The Conservatives are 80/1 to win the most seats, a scenario seen as so unlikely that a £10 punt would return £810.A Conservative majority government is also seen as so unlikely (125/1) that Oddschecker sees a Reform UK government as more likely (100/1).What went wrong for the Tories?YouGov's voting intention tracker between January 2020 and June 2024. (YouGov)So, why have the polls changed so dramatically? It's worth looking back on an extremely eventful four-and-a-half years in UK politics.According to YouGov's voting intention tracker (see chart, above), Tory support peaked at 53%, with Labour on 32%, in April 2020, months after the party's stunning success in the 2019 general election and Boris Johnson's pledge to “get Brexit done”. That month also saw Starmer take over as Labour leader from Jeremy Corbyn.This was also amid a spirit of national unity following the onset of the COVID pandemic which nearly killed Johnson himself. The then-PM had been released from hospital five days before this particular survey was taken.Boris Johnson delivers his final speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street in September 2022. (AFP via Getty Images)Over the rest of the year, there was a downturn in support amid chaos over COVID rules, with the Tories falling as low as 35% in November 2020, compared to Labour on 40%.However, the UK’s successful COVID vaccination programme provided a pathway out of lockdown and with it, improved poll ratings. Tory support peaked at 41% in June 2021, with Labour at 30%.In October that year, there was a sense Johnson was untouchable. At the Tory party conference, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg remarked how the PM was ""in total command of his party, and politically dominant in the country"".But this fell apart quickly with the Partygate scandal, which emerged in November that year. Time and again, reports emerged of government and Tory staff – including Johnson – having taken part in lockdown-era social gatherings when their own COVID rules had prohibited them.By January 2022, Tory support had plummeted to 28%, with Labour on 38%. Johnson struggled on, but never recovered and a wave of ministerial resignations forced him to resign in July that year.The UK had three separate prime ministers – Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak – between 6 September and 24 October, 2022. (Getty Images)His successor, Liz Truss, then embarked on arguably the most disastrous prime ministerial reign in history, characterised by the catastrophic ""mini-budget"", containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, which prompted an economic crisis. Like Johnson, she lost the confidence of Tory MPs – and voters – and had to resign.Her 49-day spell as PM was the shortest in history, with Tory support plummeting to 19% (with Labour on 56%) the day after she announced her resignation in October 2022.Rishi Sunak, who had lost to Truss in the previous month's Tory leadership election, took over. However, as the above YouGov chart indicates, he has failed to cut through with voters. Tory support was at 23% two days after he assumed office, with the most recent survey, carried out on Thursday, showing support is now lower than under Truss at 18%.In short, the polls and odds, not to mention other factors such as notable by-election victories for Starmer's Labour, are pointing to a Labour government next week.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

113,"Labour has been accused of “not putting up a fight” against Nigel Farage in Clacton after the party’s candidate was instructed to leave the constituency after “distracting” from Keir Starmer’s campaign.Jovan Owusu-Nepaul, 27, who works for Labour’s equalities team, was installed by the party last month to contest the seat, weeks before Farage changed his mind and decided to stand in the Essex constituency.Owusu-Nepaul has since been “seconded” to the West Midlands, while the local campaign in Clacton said that it had been banned from printing leaflets, blocked from using campaigning software and had access to the campaign’s social media overriden, with posts deleted on X.Related: ‘He’s for English people’: Farage’s populist pitch gains traction in ClactonLabour regards Clacton as an unwinnable seat, with the party gaining just 15% of the vote in 2019, when the Tories won a 24,702 majority.Members of Clacton’s constituency Labour party (CLP) had been expecting a “well planned but low energy” social media campaign.However, Owusu-Nepaul attracted attention on social media after he was photographed bumping into the Reform UK leader at an opening of a new food truck in Frinton earlier this month, with pictures going viral.A campaign source said Labour headquarters had been angry with the traction Owusu-Nepaul was getting. “At one point [Jovan] was getting more retweets than Keir Starmer. The officials were furious with him and said he was distracting [from] Starmer’s campaign,” they said.The Guardian reported last week that dozens of Labour candidates have been blocked from accessing the party’s canvassing systems, which help them drum up support from voters, because they were deemed not to be campaigning enough in target seats.Tracey Lewis, a Labour activist from Clacton, quit the CLP after Owusu-Nepaul was sent to campaign in the West Midlands.She said: “I’m a lifelong Labour supporter and will continue to be even though I’ve quit my place on the CLP, but if they can’t put a fight up against Nigel Farage, then who are they fighting for?”Chris Bee, another member of the local party, said: “Our candidate gets some real traction and with a week-and-a-bit to go they pull him out and will not allow him back into the constituency to fight for a place in this area’s most important election in a generation. This is absolutely disgusting on every level.”In a letter to Labour’s general secretary, David Evans, seen by the Guardian, Martin Suker, Owusu-Nepaul’s election agent said: “Reform UK stands for everything we the Labour party stand against … and I’m struggling to come to terms that it appears the party doesn’t even want to be seen to be putting up a fight.“Jovan was told [by an official] to never come back to Clacton, and yesterday, was instructed to move to the West Midlands region.“I’m concerned there will be follow-on questions: members, supporters and more worryingly donators will be both angry and upset that it appears like the party that they have a great hope in isn’t doing anything to show a battle front to what many see as a catastrophe not only for Clacton, but for the parliamentary system entirely.”Suker said the local party had requests for new leaflets turned down and access to the canvassing system removed. “Now I have no candidate to put in front of the people for them to see us at least trying to ‘Save Clacton’,” he added. “This could be very damaging to the party’s image.”Labour has been urging candidates to campaign more in target seats and diverting activists away from the Liberal Democrats’ priority seats to those where it stands a better chance of winning against the Tories. Clacton activists had been twinned with nearby Colchester.A Labour party spokesperson said: “We are working hard to deliver as many Labour MPs as possible in the general election and our campaigners are bringing our message of change to people across the country.”",Labour ‘not putting up a fight’ against Farage in Clacton,17,8
100,"Keir Starmer has admitted for the first time that he would not return people to Afghanistan, after a bitter exchange in Wednesday night’s debate where Rishi Sunak mocked him for planning to “sit down with the ayatollahs” to negotiate return agreements.Starmer has repeatedly said he plans to negotiate returns agreements with safe countries in order to clear the asylum backlog, which has worsened due to the government’s recent legislation which does not allow asylum seekers to be processed while it waits to start deportations to Rwanda.Asked on Thursday whether he could rule out sending people back to Afghanistan, Starmer said: “There are some things that are not sensible for the asylum policy. That was a throwaway comment from the prime minister himself who had no answer to that question.“But leaving those claims unprocessed is not the answer to that. Of course there will be countries, Afghanistan for example, where you can’t return people – people who perhaps helped us by interpreting for our troops in Afghanistan and put themselves at risk. People who in my constituency were fleeing war in Afghanistan and found we weren’t able to get them out on those flights.default“Of course, in relation to their particular cases they’re not going to be returned to Afghanistan. But what we can’t do is stay with this absurd situation where there’s just a growing and growing number to which the prime minister has got absolutely no answer. It is absurd and reckless, the position he’s taken this country.”Starmer, who was speaking on a campaign visit to a college in Burton upon Trent, has also been criticised for comments he made in a Sun debate last week which caused a backlash in the British Bangladeshi community.He said he had not intended comments about a returns agreement with Bangladesh to cause any anxiety in the community. “My first trip as a Labour MP was to Bangladesh where I saw for myself the strength of the county, hospitality and warmth of the country,” he said.“The reference in the debate the other day was an example of a country that is considered safe as far as asylum concerns and one of the countries that actually has a returns agreement with us. I certainly wasn’t intending to cause any concern or offence to any Bangladeshi community here.”Speaking to reporters at the visit, the Labour leader appeared to contradict claims from his own activists that the party was pulling resources out of Clacton in the fight against Nigel Farage, including telling its own candidate there to go elsewhere.Starmer said the campaign would continue and there was no strategy to give the Tories space to defeat Farage. “We’re not backing down in Clacton, we’re not backing down anywhere across the country,” he said. “We have to fight in Clacton of course we do. We’ve got an excellent candidate there, he actually works for me, he’s fantastic.“So I’m very supportive of both him and the campaign that he’s running. He’s doing something incredible which is being that positive candidate in difficult circumstances.”",Starmer says people would not be sent back to Afghanistan under returns policy,17,8
235,"Rolex watchesWealthy foreign shoppers seeking a Rolex have given up on Britain in favour of European cities such as Paris and Milan, the boss of the UK’s biggest luxury watch retailer has said.Brian Duffy, the chief executive of Watches of Switzerland, said the decision to axe VAT-free shopping for tourists by Rishi Sunak in the wake of Brexit had hammered its UK business.He said: “We have a high average selling price, which means that 20pc makes a hell of a difference. If you’re looking at spending £10,000, it’s £2,000.”“Clearly, the tourists coming [such as] Americans ... will choose when they’re coming to Europe to do their shopping in Paris and Barcelona, and not London.”ADVERTISEMENTSince VAT-free shopping was axed in 2020, luxury retailers have called on ministers to restore it.They argue that the decision has damaged British businesses and made the country less appealing to visitors who used to come and spend large amounts of money here, earning it the moniker “tourist tax”.Mr Duffy said: “We’re the only country in Europe that doesn’t offer [the perk].“So either we’ve figured out something that nobody else knows, or it’s another burden for retail to deal with.“We want to be an attractive destination for tourists and part of touring and being on holiday is shopping.“It just seems crazy to us.”He argued the absence of VAT-free shopping had impeded the UK’s recovery from the pandemic.“The UK just simply missed out as an economy. Europe disproportionately benefited.”His comments come as Watches of Switzerland posted a 2pc rise in total sales over the year to April 1, but said sales in the UK and Europe were down 5pc.Statutory profits before tax fell 40pc to £92m.As well as the impact of the tourist tax, the company has had to grapple with price increases linked to the rising price of gold.And “aspirational” shoppers are spending less money because of high interest rates and the cost of living crisis, he said.Mr Duffy said: “We’ve had a wee bit of a perfect storm if you look back, particularly the second half of the calendar [year] 2023.”",Sunak’s tourist tax ‘means Rolex shoppers have given up on Britain’,17,11
78,"Independent readers are divided following another televised head-to-head between Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer.We asked for your opinions following the final party leader clash on BBC, revealing mixed reactions from our community. Some viewers noted an improvement in how Sir Keir challenged Mr Sunak compared to the first debate, with one adding: “Starmer seems to be getting more statesmanlike over time.”But others found Sir Keir too polite and unable to land impactful blows. One reader noted: “Starmer is articulate, but just has not got the bruising instincts of real ‘Old’ Labour politicians.”On the other end of the spectrum, many readers criticised Mr Sunak’s approach as too aggressive, with one observing: “Rishi Sunak has continued his obnoxious and irritating debating style.”Once again, there were calls for better debate moderation, with some blaming the chair for not controlling interruptions.Overall, the clash was seen by many as lacking substantive discussion, reducing it to a spectacle of squabbling and point-scoring.Here’s what you had to say:‘Statesmanlike’Starmer seems to be getting more statesmanlike over time. I don’t think this type of debate is his natural habitat but he had Sunak on the ropes a couple of times.Obviously, Sunak wants the tax worry to lodge in voters’ brains as their pencils hover over Labour and I think he did a reasonably effective if slightly irritating job of getting that across.PaulWaulCaul‘Obnoxious and irritating’Rishi Sunak has continued his obnoxious and irritating debating style. You would think that all that time at private school would have taught him how to debate in a more dignified way. He is using this bolshy style to hide his poor track record on policies, leadership and Tory Party scandals (PPE, covid rule-breaking, unfinished inquiries, foreign interference etc etc)I wish the chair would have been more forthright in controlling the debate.Rachel92‘Mocking Starmer’I believe Rishi had won. Not due to good policy making or a clear set of plans, but because of his use of populism and sensationalism that brought him thunderous applause through his strong words. This was especially seen with mocking Starmer about the idea of working with the Taliban.Thecoldwarguy‘Lies’Sunak came across as rude and increasingly desperate. He thinks if you tell a lie often enough, the population will believe it. The problem he has is that he lies every time he moves his lips.Pearson‘I fear the worst with a Labour government’Sunak came out as a contender with real stuff. Sir Keir as usual is living in the past with a lot of waffle as the plan for the future. I fear the worst with a Labour government.Krispad‘A low bar’All Starmer needs to do in these debates is to not mess up or cause hugely negative headlines. That’s a low bar. He nearly tripped. I would say with doubt that Starmer won only because Sunak has no credibility on any one main topic, whereas Starmer has a little credibility still intact.ItReallyIsNot‘Bully who wants to score points’How did a forensic interviewer like Mishal Hussein fail to stop the constant tetchy and childish interruptions/ talking over Starmer by Sunak?Who will make a better PM? Sunak who shouts over Starmer’s contributions and tells lies: pensioners already pay tax on pensions, or ignores facts such as Tory councils going bust.OR Starmer who may not set the world alight but is measured, thoughtful and actually listens and tries to answer the questions when he is not being shouted over.Who would chair a cabinet meeting where all feel empowered to make contributions? StarmerWho would actually listen to voters rather than interrupt them? StarmerStarmer needed more powerful one-liners to stop himself being interrupted once it was clear that the moderator was not going to do it. He came over as a person who wants to unite the country.Sunak came over as an overexcited small-time playground bully who wants to score points.Lada‘Pantomime’Both lost badly. The pantomime can hardly be classified as a political debate, no real and urgent policies were just remotely mentioned. The UK electorate got the expected pub brawl and nothing else.Both dismal characters knows the UK must raise many billions just to stop the decline after +40 years of Thatcherite pawn, sale and plunder policies, topped with +14 years of needless Tory austerity and corruption. But none of them dare, and the UK electorate largely live in a fantasy world of convenient denial, bickering over platitudes and obvious ineptitude.Sir Keir and his new crew of former Tory sponsors will not go for vital reforms of the UK “democracy” and cannot/will not face reality. And the Sunak gang agree.old dane‘Poorly chaired’Poorly chaired debate by Mishal Hussain. Too much squabbling due to poorly chosen questions from the audience that Sunak answered unchecked by Hussain on the answers while Starmer fumbled. Dreadful. The real loser in this debate is the BBC.Kernow‘Mansplaining’Neither. A pair of men mansplaining and talking over each other-as if one-upmanship was the most important thing to get right. No mention of the Climate Crisis just, ‘He’s going to raise taxes’ ‘No! HE’S going raise taxes!’ on repeat. And both happy to demise and scapegoat vulnerable refugees for their own, political, point-scoring purposes. Depressing.To paraphrase the comments by one chap in the audience; ‘is this the best we’ve got? Carline Lucas for PM!, I say.LizzieM‘Grave mistake’The English electorate made a grave mistake in 2010, and doubled down on this in 2015. It’s not rocket science, but why would anyone trust the Tories with the NHS, unless of course, you didn’t care.Austerity - what were people thinking. Cameron and Osborne remain unrepentant, but come on, the English electorate bought this rubbish! And then, once again, the English electorate buy the multiple Brexit lies, which leads to Johnson, Truss, Sunak and Co. Oh my God, were these representative of the best of what England could offer?!Sunak debates as if Starmer is PM, I suppose it is worth a punt, for the English electorate have repeatedly bought this crap for 14 years. Starmer, like Brown, is a decent man, let’s hope he can begin (and I say begin) to reverse the damage brought about by 14 years of Tory misrule.Ultimately, it is those who voted Tory that bear responsibility. You believed the lies regarding austerity, taxes, Brexit, the NHS, education, etc. The list is endless.mpsurf‘Cheap shot’I felt that it was an extremely cheap shot to choose the awful question which accused both leaders of simply being mediocre. I thought this debased and trivialised the debate. It was pointless as there was no answer to make - no answer anyone could sensibly make.This lowering of debate to insult encourages a cynical, non-voting attitude amongst the viewing audience - which incidentally will only benefit one party.Finally I’m not sure voters can really simply blame their politicians for the state of the body politic, we must also take some responsibility. Perhaps politicians don’t always tell us the truth, because they know full well we never reward them for doing it.Elizabethz‘Empty promises’Felt like Sunak has at least some policies in place for illegal immigration and funding tax cuts rather than making empty promises like Labour. At the moment it looks like Labour is riding on anti-Tories sentiment rather than credibility of themselves and hence I understand the word ‘Surrender’ being used.I am more inclined towards Mr Sunak. Having shown what he can do in the last 18 months.Oracle‘Much better than last time’I think Starmer did much better in this debate than last time. I feel like Sunak’s adolescent, aggressive debate style gets under his skin (tbh I think it gets under everyone’s skin!) - and made him visibly angry at times. And I think he did better when he was fired up.This isn’t Starmer’s natural habitat but I feel he came across as serious and thoughtful - if still trying to stay on message a bit too much; while Sunak came across as smug and petulant. I’m a Labour supporter of course! But I was much happier after this debate than the first one…In all of these “debates”, Sunak has been allowed to constantly interrupt and shout over Starmer, and also peddle lies without being challenged. Not sure how that can be called winning.Kvasir‘Sunak will soon be history’Starmer appeared understandably nonplussed by the tetchy, obnoxious, lying Sunak. This wasn’t a debate but a sixth form diatribe from an overheated little squib that only had two or three insults rehearsed from some scribbled notes he no doubt thought were top dollar scathing insights but were just the last desperate clueless attempts to clawback something, anything, from the impending utter crushing defeat that was looming ever larger.Sunak will soon be history but, sadly, he will go on to be even more wealthy, secure in his self-belief, blaming everyone else for the disaster he left behind.JiminyCricket‘Starmer always comes off worse’Sunak has always been a terrier, baring his teeth and snapping ferociously to make up for a loss of superior arguments. If you go back to the debates held before the December 2019 GE when Johnson sent him out to face the cameras on behalf of the Tories, you’ll see that this is one of his strengths, honed by being schooled in this quick-fire exchange manner so popular in Britain’s public schools.Sunak will always deploy weapons which he believes will leave a mark, and the chief of these last night was scaremongering. It is more than a little ironic that arch-Brexiteer Sunak, who back in 2016 mercilessly attacked the Remain side for what was called Project Fear, used exactly the same tactics when confronting Starmer. These were reinforced through the highly emotive word “surrender”.However, Sunak did make a number of legitimate points amidst all the shouting. It is naive and disingenuous for Starmer to claim that he’ll be able to renegotiate the Brexit deal without offering something substantial in return. He’s ruled out freedom of movement, so he has virtually nothing he can offer the other side.In debating, Starmer always comes off worse for the simple reason that he cannot think on his feet. That’s not something that a barrister or a DPP is routinely required to do. Attempting to stay above the fray and appear prime ministerial in waiting has paid off for him with regard to the polls, but it doesn’t bode at all well for a role in government. Sunak was bad enough but I despair at the thought of Starmer in Downing Street: strategically shortsighted, deluded in his insistence that Labour will somehow be able to deliver growth, and without the force of character and rhetorical skills to persuade the British public of the need to endure yet more hardship.aavo80‘An insult to the British people’These so-called debates are a waste of time. With one week to go, if you have not already decided, then this debate will not alter that fact. From now until the election, the poles are not going to move that much.But the whole format of the debate was unbelievable and a total embarrassment. You have Sunak repeat proven lies like they are facts, shout over the chair and opposition, he looked like he was reading from notes provided.I found the whole debate to be unprofessional and an insult to the British people who wanted a clear discussion on the merits of both parties and policies, and not a p****** match.Both candidates and the BBC did not come over at all well.WhatsupSome of the comments have been edited for this article.

Under a video of Muslims praying, he is said to have commented “gas” with several laughing emojis.Mr Lilley previously argued that the pandemic was a plan to “depopulate the world” and was “mass murder by government”.He is one of the 41 Reform UK candidates who are “friends” on Facebook with Gary Raikes, a former organiser for the British National Party who founded the New British Union in the image of Oswald Mosley’s British Union of Fascists, with activists who call themselves blackshirts.Mr Lilley is the latest candidate to be exposed for appearing to make extreme comments. Nigel Farage, the Reform leader, has blamed the party’s vetting company and has threatened legal action against them.The vetting company has blamed the timing of the election for its inability to complete the checks in time.Reform has dropped and replaced several candidates for controversial comments on social media, though only one candidate has been suspended since formal nominations closed on June 7.Grant StClair-Armstrong, who is standing against Kemi Badenoch in the North West Essex constituency, will still appear on the ballot paper along with the Reform UK name, but if elected he would be an independent.He was dropped by the party after comments found by The Times in which he called on people to vote for the BNP.Reform did not comment despite three requests to do so. It has previously said that its candidates are “not party political zombies” and that the party was “proud that they think and speak like the ordinary people they are”.A spokesman has previously said that candidates “have views of their own and are as free to express them as anyone else, even if they are not shared by all their party colleagues”.Mr Lilley has been contacted for comment.",Reform candidate ‘said he wanted to slaughter migrants and have their family taken out’,16,11
248,"Since May 2023, voters across the UK have been asked to show a form of photographic ID at their local ballot box.The requirement draws on the recommendations of a 2016 report by Lord Pickles, the former communities secretary, which warned there was a risk of “significant abuse” in the electoral system if people could vote under false pretences with little risk of detection.As Labour continues to hold a lead of around 20 percentage points in the latest election opinion polls, The Telegraph sets out everything you need to know about voting rules ahead of the general election on July 4.Here are the acceptable forms of identification you can bring to vote for an election candidate. Read the latest election pollsFollow The Telegraph’s general election live coverageWhat are the voter ID requirements?Everyone wanting to vote in the UK must produce photo ID to take part in certain elections.For voters in England, Scotland and Wales, this includes UK parliamentary elections, by-elections and recall petitions. Those in England also need their ID for local elections.The requirement does not apply to Holyrood, Senedd or council elections in Scotland and Wales. People in Northern Ireland already needed photo ID to vote, so the rule change does not affect them.Voters in both England and Wales also need ID for police and crime commissioner elections.The rule has been applied in stages, beginning with the local elections in England on May 4, 2023. This year’s general election will be the first time ID is required for a national poll.The change marks a significant departure from the previous system in most of the UK, where voters only had to verbally confirm their name and address.What types of ID are accepted?Voters are required to show one form of photo ID at the polls, and it does not need to be in date so long as it is recognisable as the person at the ballot box.However, it must be the original version – not a photocopy – and the name on the ID should be the same as it appears on the electoral register.Acceptable forms of voter ID include:Passport issued by the UK, any of the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, a British Overseas Territory, an EEA state or a Commonwealth country (including an Irish Passport Card)Full or provisional driving licence issued by the UK, any of the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, or an EEA stateA Blue BadgeAny identity card bearing the Pass (Proof of Age Standards Scheme) hologramAny of the following travel passes:Older person’s bus pass funded by the GovernmentDisabled person’s bus pass funded by the GovernmentOyster 60+ card funded by the GovernmentFreedom passScottish national entitlement card issued for the purpose of concessionary travel (including a 60+, disabled or under 22s bus pass)60 and over Welsh concessionary travel cardDisabled person’s Welsh concessionary travel cardSenior SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandRegistered blind SmartPass or blind person’s SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandWar disablement SmartPass issued in Northern Ireland60+ SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandHalf fare SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandAny of these government-issued documents:Biometric immigration documentMinistry of Defence Form 90 (Defence Identity Card)National identity card issued by an EEA stateElectoral identity card issued in Northern IrelandVoter authority certificateAnonymous elector’s documentDo the rules apply to postal votes?No. You do not need to have any form of photo ID to vote by post.The deadline to apply for a postal vote was 5pm on June 19 in England, Scotland and Wales, with June 15 the limit in Northern Ireland.However, those who applied on time were asked to provide your National Insurance (NI) number to verify their identity. If you were not able to do this, you will need to explain why.Those who registered in time will automatically be sent their postal ballot and are advised to fill out the forms and post them back for free as soon as they can.There is no formal deadline for this but leaving it too close to polling day may mean your vote could not be delivered in time to be counted.How can I get a voter ID card?The deadline to apply for a VAC passed on June 26 at 5pm.Those who applied on time will receive a voter authority certificate (VAC) either online or by post. To complete the application, a recent digital photo of yourself and your NI number was required.For those without an NI number, it was possible to provide alternative documents as proof of identity, such as a birth certificate, a bank statement or utility bill.What if I do not have a valid ID?Anyone without a form of ID that fits the requirements was still able to apply for a VAC, but must have done so before the 5pm deadline on June 26.This is not a substitute to registering for vote, which must have been done in advance of any application.Why was voter ID introduced?The aim was to stamp out voter fraud by forcing people to prove their identity at the polls.In his Government-commissioned report, Lord Pickles warned that the authorities were in a “state of denial” and “turning a blind eye” to the problem of electoral fraud.Why is voter ID so controversial?The Government has said the change is necessary to curb the “inexcusable potential” for “stealing someone’s vote” by simply quoting their name and address at the ballot box.However, critics say actual claims of electoral fraud are very rare in the UK.In 2019, the last general election year, there were only 33 allegations of impersonation at the polling station out of more than 58 million votes cast, according to the Electoral Reform Society.Opponents of the rule have also warned it will make it more difficult for certain people to vote, including the disabled, transgender and non-binary people, and black and ethnic minority groups.",The photo ID you need to vote in UK elections,17,11
230,"Rishi Sunak’s election campaign has been dealt a major blow in the run up to July 4 as his party becomes embroiled in a controversial betting scandal.An ongoing investigation by the Gambling Commission has now led to two Conservative party candidates seeing support withdrawn by the party. At least three more party figures and seven police officers are being investigated, alongside one Labour candidate.Cabinet minister Alister Jack recently came under fire for “joking” about placing three bets on the timing of the election. After some pressure, he later admitted he was telling the truth, but that the bets were placed before May. The minister for Scotland has denied being under investigation.For the latest political updates ahead of the general election, follow The Independent’s live coverageThe following day, Tory MP Sir Phillip Davies came under fire when it was reported he had placed a slightly different bet: £8,000 that he would lose his seat of Shipley. He is defending a 6,242 majority in the West Yorkshire seat. Sir Phillip has denied doing anything illegal, and it is not believed he is under investigation.First uncovered two weeks ago, the scandal began when it was revealed now-suspended Conservative candidate Craig Williams placed a bet of £100 on the election taking place in July, just 3 days before Sunak announced the date in May.Several people with ties to the Conservatives have subsequently been placed under investigation for allegedly placing similar bets on when the general election would take place.Responding to the discovery, Mr Williams said: “I put a flutter on the general election some weeks ago. This has resulted in some routine inquiries and I confirm I will fully cooperate with these.”Tory betting scandal: Tony Lee, Chris Williams, Alister Jack, Rishi Sunak, Laura Saunders, Russell George (Getty/PA/Supplied)“I don’t want it to be a distraction from the campaign, I should have thought how it looks.”He was suspended nearly two weeks later alongside fellow Tory candidate Laura Saunders. The move drew criticism from many opposition and Conservative MPs alike, who said the prime minister was too slow too act.Speaking to The Independent, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer slammed the prime minister for his handling of the scandal: “If they had been my candidates, they’d have been straight out of the door and their feet wouldn’t have touched the floor”“But to wait a week, to make excuses like that, is inexcusable.”Amongst the six Metropolitan police officers being investigated, one has been arrested – a member of Mr Sunak’s close protection team. The Met has also denied being the source of names under investigation leaked to press, calling the speculation “a poor distraction technique.”The Gambling Commission has now expanded its investigation to look at hundreds of suspicious bets in the run up to the general election.“These investigations are ongoing … one of them is a criminal investigation that’s being conducted by the police,” the prime minister told the BBC Question Time Leaders Special general election debate.“What I can tell you is if anyone is found to have broken the rules, not only should they face the full consequences of the law, I will make sure that they are booted out of the Conservative Party.”Who is involved in the betting scandal?Craig WilliamsCraig Williams, the PM’s closest parliamentary aide, was the first person caught up in the scandal. He admitted placing a bet on the election prior to Mr Sunak’s announcement after he was approached by a journalist.The 39-year-old Tory candidate for Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr placed a £100 bet with 5-1 odds at Ladbrokes, meaning he would have won £500, but his name was raised as potentially a “politically exposed person”, so the wager was not registered.Former MP Craig Williams (UK Parliament)That sparked the Gambling Commission writing to firms demanding the details of all bets made on a July election after 1 May, which it is now combing through. It is now believed to have widened its search beyond MPs and candidates to their friends and relatives as well.Bookmakers are particularly cautious over “novelty” betting markets such as the general election.According to The Guardian, which first reported the story, Mr Williams placed his bet via an online account that would have required him to provide personal details, including his date of birth and debit card. The bookmaker also knows the location of the bet.Ladbrokes declined to comment on the incident but the Gambling Commission issued a statement confirming that it was investigating.Mr Williams apologised after admiting that he had placed a wager on the bet, but refused to comment further while the GC carried out its probe.“I clearly made a huge error of judgment, that’s for sure, and I apologise,” he told. “I will not be expanding on my statement because it’s an independent process.”Laura SaundersLaura Saunders was the second person to be named in the affair.Tory candidate for Bristol North West, Ms Saunders is also under investigation by the Gambling Commission over claims she may have had inside knowledge about the prime minister’s decision to call a snap poll for 4 July. She has worked for the party since 2015.Laura Saunders and Tony Lee pictured together (Supplied)According to the BBC, which first named Ms Saunders as the candidate under investigation, she worked most recently at the party’s international division at Conservative Campaign Headquarters, which works with other centre-right parties around the world.Tony LeeTony Lee, husband of Ms Saunders, has also been implicated in the scandal. He is the Conservative Party’s director of campaigning, having worked on former West Midlands mayor Andy Street’s successful 2021 campaign.Mr Lee stepped back from his position on June 19 following reports that he was also under investigation by the Gambling Commission alongside his wife.Nick MasonNick Mason became the Tory chief data officer after unsuccessfully running for the party for Jarrow in Tyneside in the 2015. He was named by The Sunday Times as the fourth person to be investigated by the Gambling Commission.Mr Mason is alleged to have placed dozens of bets over an unknown period, with winnings which would total thousands of pounds. He has also taken a leave of absence from his position. A spokeperson for Mr Mason has declined to comment but denies wrong doing.Russell GeorgeRussell George is a Tory member of Welsh parliament, representing the same constituency as Mr Williams. It was revealed by The Guardian on June 25 that he was under investigation by the gambling watchdog.Welsh Conservatives leader Andrew RT Davies said: “Russell George has informed me that he has received a letter from the Gambling Commission regarding bets on the timing of the general election.“Russell George has stepped back from the Welsh Conservative shadow cabinet while these investigations are ongoing.”He says that all other Conservative members of the Senedd have denied placing any bets.Kevin CraigBringing the scandal to the Labour party, now-suspended candidate Kevin Craig was also confirmed to be under investigation by the gambling watchdog on June 25Running in Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, Mr Craig had bet on himself to lose the seat on July 4. The seat was won by the Conservatives with a majority of just over 20,000 in 2019.Former Labour candidate Kevin Craig (YouTube)Releasing a statement on social media, Mr Craig said he had made a “stupid error,” adding that he intended to give his winnings to charity.“This was a huge mistake, for which I apologise unreservedly,” he said.“I have so much respect for how Keir Starmer has changed the Labour Party and I have been fighting so hard to win this seat and change the country alongside him.“However, it is right that the party upholds the highest standards for its Parliamentary candidates - just as the public expects the highest standards from any party hoping to serve in government.”Alister JackConservative cabinet minister Alister Jack admitted to placing three bets on the date of the general election on June 25, saying he had made £2,100 from one of them. He later claimed his comments were “a joke”.The minister for Scotland then backtracked, admitting that he had placed several bets before May. In April, Mr Jack says he placed a successful bet that the election would fall between July and September, after losing two similar bets made in March.Scotland minister Alister Jack (Michal Wachucik/PA) (PA Wire)Mr Jack has denied wrongdoing in a statement: “I had no knowledge of the date of the election until the day it was called.“I placed no bets in May and am not under investigation by the Gambling Commission.”Sir Phillip DaviesSir Phillip Davies has been the Conservative MP for Shipley, West Yorkshire since 2005 and is married to cabinet minister Esther McVey. He is currently the most rebellious serving Tory MP, having voted against the government over 250 times.On June 26, Sir Phillip was accused of placing an £8,000 bet to lose the seat he has held for nearly 20 years. He denies any wrongdoing.“I hope to win. I’m busting a gut to win. I expect to lose. In the 2005 election, I busted a gut to win. I expected to lose,” the MP told The Sun.“I had a bet on myself to lose in the 2005 election, and my bet went down the pan.”“It’s nobody’s business apart from mine,” Sir Phillip said, adding that he had not done anything illegal. It is not believed that he is under investigation by the Gambling Commission.A police officer in Rishi Sunak’s close protection teamA police officer in Mr Sunak’s close protection team was arrested and suspended over alleged bets about the timing of the general election.The police constable from the Met’s Royalty and Specialist Protection Command was arrested on 17 June on suspicion of misconduct in public office after the betting watchdog contacted the force last Friday.The officer was taken into custody and bailed pending further enquiries, with the case being referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, according to the Met. The force has confirmed is serving on restricted duties.Six more police officersOn June 25, the Met confirmed that they had been informed of five more police officers placed under investigation by the Gambling Commission, raising the number to six on June 27.In a statement, the London police force said: “The officers are based on the Royalty and Specialist Command, the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command and the Central West Basic Command Unit. None of them work in a close protection role.“Decisions on whether they will be subject to any restrictions will be taken in due course.”What are the rules for MPs and others on betting with inside knowledge?Using confidential information to gain an unfair advantage when betting may constitute a criminal offence. Gamblers are not allowed to use inside information to place a bet or to instruct someone else to do so on their behalf.They are also not allowed to pass inside information on to someone else which they use for betting.Additionally, the MPs’ code of conduct bars members from “causing significant damage to the reputation and integrity of the house”. An MP placing a bet with inside knowledge is likely to cross this threshold.",Everything we know about Tory election betting scandal – and who is being investigated,17,9
374,"With little over a week to go until the general election, five separate opinion polls continue to show a large Labour lead over the Conservatives.Prime minister Rishi Sunak will have been hoping to make a dent in Labour’s position but the campaign has been far from perfect for the Tories. It is now looking ever-more likely that Sir Keir Starmer will be prime minister by next Friday.Nigel Farage may yet have a good election night as Reform UK are currently in third place in the polls. The polling for the party has slipped following the controversy over Farage’s comments about the war in Ukraine but the party is still some five percentage points ahead of the Lib Dems.There was even further grim reading for the Tories on 26 June, when a separate poll conducted by Ipsos for the Evening Standard claimed that a record seven out of 10 Britons do not like the Conservative Party.Yahoo News UK summaries the positions of the parties according to five separate opinion polls.No major changes show Labour on course for large victoryA poll by Savanta puts Labour on 42% – 21 points ahead of the Tories, who are on 21%. Ipsos also puts Labour on 42%, compared to 19% for the Tories, while JL Partners give similar results, with Labour on 41% and the Tories on 25%.A Verian poll shows Labour on 38%, with the Tories on 21%, while Survation show Labour on 41%, compared to a historic low of 18% for the Tories.An average of opinion polls from February to June this year. (PA)An average of all polls with survey work completed during the seven days to 26 June puts Labour on 41%, 21 points ahead of the Conservatives on 20%, followed by Reform on 16%, the Lib Dems on 11% and the Greens on 6% – unchanged on the figures for the previous week.On 22 May, the day Sunak called the election, the seven-day averages stood at Labour 45%, Conservatives 23%, Reform 11%, Lib Dems 9% and Greens 6%.Tories could slump to lowest number of seatsEarlier this month, three major polls showed the Tories were on course for a historic defeat, with one projection showing the party potentially slumping to the lowest number of seats since the party was formed.Using the multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP) technique, which enables projections to be made at constituency level, YouGov's polling for Sky News projected Labour being on course to achieve a 200-seat majority. The poll suggested Labour would secure 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.The YouGov poll for Sky News.A More In Common UK poll for the News Agents podcast showed Labour projecting to finish on 406 seats, with the Conservatives on 155.Meanwhile, polling by Savanta and Electoral Calculus for the Telegraph, showed Sunak could become the first sitting prime minister to lose his seat of Richmond and Northallerton to Labour. It put Labour on 516 seats, with the Tories on just 53.What are the latest odds?As of 26 June, Oddschecker – a website which compares odds across different bookmakers – had Labour at 1/41 to win the most seats. To put that in context, this is seen as so likely that a £10 bet would return just £10.24.The Conservatives are 80/1 to win the most seats, a scenario seen as so unlikely that a £10 punt would return £810.A Conservative majority government is also seen as so unlikely (125/1) that Oddschecker sees a Reform UK government as more likely (100/1).What went wrong for the Tories?YouGov's voting intention tracker between January 2020 and June 2024. (YouGov)So, why have the polls changed so dramatically? It's worth looking back on an extremely eventful four-and-a-half years in UK politics.According to YouGov's voting intention tracker (see chart, above), Tory support peaked at 53%, with Labour on 32%, in April 2020, months after the party's stunning success in the 2019 general election and Boris Johnson's pledge to “get Brexit done”. That month also saw Starmer take over as Labour leader from Jeremy Corbyn.This was also amid a spirit of national unity following the onset of the COVID pandemic which nearly killed Johnson himself. The then-PM had been released from hospital five days before this particular survey was taken.Boris Johnson delivers his final speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street in September 2022. (AFP via Getty Images)Over the rest of the year, there was a downturn in support amid chaos over COVID rules, with the Tories falling as low as 35% in November 2020, compared to Labour on 40%.However, the UK’s successful COVID vaccination programme provided a pathway out of lockdown and with it, improved poll ratings. Tory support peaked at 41% in June 2021, with Labour at 30%.In October that year, there was a sense Johnson was untouchable. At the Tory party conference, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg remarked how the PM was ""in total command of his party, and politically dominant in the country"".But this fell apart quickly with the Partygate scandal, which emerged in November that year. Time and again, reports emerged of government and Tory staff – including Johnson – having taken part in lockdown-era social gatherings when their own COVID rules had prohibited them.By January 2022, Tory support had plummeted to 28%, with Labour on 38%. Johnson struggled on, but never recovered and a wave of ministerial resignations forced him to resign in July that year.The UK had three separate prime ministers – Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak – between 6 September and 24 October, 2022. (Getty Images)His successor, Liz Truss, then embarked on arguably the most disastrous prime ministerial reign in history, characterised by the catastrophic ""mini-budget"", containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, which prompted an economic crisis. Like Johnson, she lost the confidence of Tory MPs – and voters – and had to resign.Her 49-day spell as PM was the shortest in history, with Tory support plummeting to 19% (with Labour on 56%) the day after she announced her resignation in October 2022.Rishi Sunak, who had lost to Truss in the previous month's Tory leadership election, took over. However, as the above YouGov chart indicates, he has failed to cut through with voters. Tory support was at 23% two days after he assumed office, with the most recent survey, carried out on Thursday, showing support is now lower than under Truss at 18%.In short, the polls and odds, not to mention other factors such as notable by-election victories for Starmer's Labour, are pointing to a Labour government next week.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

Not my seat – I think that would be wrong.”Westminster has been engulfed by a gambling scandal, with five Conservatives being investigated by the Gambling Commission over alleged election bets. However, there is no suggestion that any of them have broken the criminal law.Mr Hollinrake said: “This situation has definitely opened up a debate that we should have a proper debate about and decide whether it’s right or wrong that people have a bet on things they are involved in.”The odds of the Conservative Party winning the election on July 4 are 125/1, according to Oddschecker.It comes after Sir Philip Davies, a senior Conservative was accused of placing an £8,000 bet that he would lose his seat at the election.The Sun reported that Sir Philip, defending a 6,242-vote majority in Shipley, West Yorkshire, had placed the wager.

113,"Labour has been accused of “not putting up a fight” against Nigel Farage in Clacton after the party’s candidate was instructed to leave the constituency after “distracting” from Keir Starmer’s campaign.Jovan Owusu-Nepaul, 27, who works for Labour’s equalities team, was installed by the party last month to contest the seat, weeks before Farage changed his mind and decided to stand in the Essex constituency.Owusu-Nepaul has since been “seconded” to the West Midlands, while the local campaign in Clacton said that it had been banned from printing leaflets, blocked from using campaigning software and had access to the campaign’s social media overriden, with posts deleted on X.Related: ‘He’s for English people’: Farage’s populist pitch gains traction in ClactonLabour regards Clacton as an unwinnable seat, with the party gaining just 15% of the vote in 2019, when the Tories won a 24,702 majority.Members of Clacton’s constituency Labour party (CLP) had been expecting a “well planned but low energy” social media campaign.However, Owusu-Nepaul attracted attention on social media after he was photographed bumping into the Reform UK leader at an opening of a new food truck in Frinton earlier this month, with pictures going viral.A campaign source said Labour headquarters had been angry with the traction Owusu-Nepaul was getting. “At one point [Jovan] was getting more retweets than Keir Starmer. The officials were furious with him and said he was distracting [from] Starmer’s campaign,” they said.The Guardian reported last week that dozens of Labour candidates have been blocked from accessing the party’s canvassing systems, which help them drum up support from voters, because they were deemed not to be campaigning enough in target seats.Tracey Lewis, a Labour activist from Clacton, quit the CLP after Owusu-Nepaul was sent to campaign in the West Midlands.She said: “I’m a lifelong Labour supporter and will continue to be even though I’ve quit my place on the CLP, but if they can’t put a fight up against Nigel Farage, then who are they fighting for?”Chris Bee, another member of the local party, said: “Our candidate gets some real traction and with a week-and-a-bit to go they pull him out and will not allow him back into the constituency to fight for a place in this area’s most important election in a generation. This is absolutely disgusting on every level.”In a letter to Labour’s general secretary, David Evans, seen by the Guardian, Martin Suker, Owusu-Nepaul’s election agent said: “Reform UK stands for everything we the Labour party stand against … and I’m struggling to come to terms that it appears the party doesn’t even want to be seen to be putting up a fight.“Jovan was told [by an official] to never come back to Clacton, and yesterday, was instructed to move to the West Midlands region.“I’m concerned there will be follow-on questions: members, supporters and more worryingly donators will be both angry and upset that it appears like the party that they have a great hope in isn’t doing anything to show a battle front to what many see as a catastrophe not only for Clacton, but for the parliamentary system entirely.”Suker said the local party had requests for new leaflets turned down and access to the canvassing system removed. “Now I have no candidate to put in front of the people for them to see us at least trying to ‘Save Clacton’,” he added. “This could be very damaging to the party’s image.”Labour has been urging candidates to campaign more in target seats and diverting activists away from the Liberal Democrats’ priority seats to those where it stands a better chance of winning against the Tories.

84,"It’s set to become 2024’s version of Brenda from Bristol’s infamous “Not another one !”Robert Blackstock spoke for the nation when, at last night’s BBC’s leader’s debate between Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer, he asked: “Are you two really the best that we’ve got?”Perhaps he was thinking of generations past when cabinets were crammed with political giants rather than ambitious third sector employees and hedge fund managers.You could almost hear the entire country nodding their heads in doleful agreement. If the polls are correct, we’re heading for a Labour super-majority next Thursday, and yet public enthusiasm for either of the main parties is virtually non-existent. There has always been a healthy cynicism about politics and politicians in the British psyche, but it’s hard to remember such an intense feeling of “A plague on both your houses” as we have seen in the current contest.And most of the responsibility must be placed on the two men who took centre stage in last night’s debate in Nottingham.True, global circumstances necessarily curtail both Labour’s and the Conservatives’ room for manœuvre; with the after-effects of the Covid pandemic still haunting the Treasury, and Putin performing his Adolf Hitler tribute act in Ukraine, the prospects of a peaceful, prosperous future have rarely looked bleaker. But neither Starmer nor Sunak can escape their responsibility for the depressingly poor level of debate and engagement that this year’s election has engendered.Rishi Sunak is the accidental prime minister, rejected by his own grassroots in favour of Liz Truss (think about that for a moment), before being foisted on the country by Tory MPs fearful of allowing party members another chance to choose a prime minister. The fact that he was even in a position to become a candidate for No 10 after Boris Johnson’s premiership exploded is down to sheer luck: Sunak just happened to be chief secretary to the Treasury – the most junior post in the Cabinet – when Johnson sacked his chancellor, Sajid Javid, and needed a replacement double quick. Then Covid happened and Sunak was able to take credit (if that’s the word) for both the furlough scheme and the “Eat out to help out” scheme.Starmer’s own rise to the top has been just as unlikely. Elected to the Commons in 2015 (at the same time as Sunak), he was immediately talked of as a possible candidate for leader, largely thanks to his national reputation as Director of Public Prosecutions. Note that he was not known for his oratorial or even his political skills: they were an unknown quantity at the time when he was being urged, just weeks after the 2015 election, to throw his hat in the ring against Jeremy Corbyn.His tenure as shadow Brexit secretary placed him in the cross-hairs of critics who lamented Labour’s appalling self-inflicted and self-contradictory agonies over leaving the EU. But a clever, if dishonest pitch to the 2018 Labour conference, promising that the next Labour government would give voters a chance to overturn the result of the 2016 EU referendum, all but guaranteed his position as heir apparent when Labour lost the next election.That Starmer subsequently succeeded in routing the hard-Left and forcing the party back onto the centre ground justified the faith of those who promoted his leadership in the first place, but that was more a happy accident than thoughtful political strategy.While Sunak has struggled to perform an impression of a statesman at this election – his early departure from the D-Day commemoration for no good reason put paid to any aspiration to be Churchill’s heir – Starmer has failed to generate even a modicum of interest, let alone excitement, among those not already fully signed up to the Labour project.Where Tony Blair attracted attention, and opposition, for his various political stances, such as his embrace of working class aspiration – something that Starmer hasn’t dared even mention so far – the Labour leader has spent the last five weeks looking like someone who wants to be left alone and ignored, as if waiting for the polls to close so that he can jump up from behind the door of No 10 shouting “Surprise !”Perhaps the electorate gets the leaders they deserve. We are a nation of unapologetic opportunists, demanding that politicians solve all our problems while spending none of our money (or at least only spending other people’s money) to do so. We claim to respect those few courageous politicians who tell us the truth; we just don’t vote for such incautious fools.So the answer to Mr Blackstock’s question is yes; yes, this is the best that we’ve got. For now, at least. No one knows how this particular gentleman will vote, or if he votes at all. But we can be reasonably sure that if Labour breaks all political records with its majority next week, it will do so with one of the lowest turnouts on record. Another record.",Only one man has spoken for the nation in this joyless election campaign,17,11
327,"The election results in a handful of seats in England will be watched particularly closely, because of their status as “bellwethers”.– What are bellwether seats?In general elections, constituencies where the local result has a habit of matching the overall national outcome are known as bellwethers.They are seats that have a pattern of changing hands only when the government itself changes hands.A small number of constituencies have been bellwethers for decades, and as such are watched with interest for what they may – or may not – suggest about the outcome of the entire election.– Which seat has the longest record for being a bellwether?Dartford in Kent.Since 1964, whichever party wins Dartford has also gone on to form the government.At this election, Conservative candidate Gareth Johnson is defending a notional majority in Dartford of 14,704.(PA Graphics)It is described as a notional majority, because it is what Mr Johnson is likely to have won in 2019 had that contest taken place using the new constituency boundaries that have been introduced across the UK for the 2024 election.– Is Dartford likely to keep its bellwether status at this election? Were Labour to form the next government, Dartford would remain a bellwether only if it too was won by Sir Keir Starmer’s party.Labour needs a direct swing in the share of the vote of 15.9 percentage points to gain Dartford from the Conservatives.This is the equivalent of a net change of 16 in every 100 people who voted Tory last time switching sides.The swing is large enough to rank Dartford at number 185 on Labour’s list of targets, making it the type of seat likely to change hands if the party was heading for a landslide victory.– What are the next longest-running bellwethers?Three seats have been bellwethers at every general election since February 1974: Loughborough, Northampton North and Watford.All three are top Labour targets at this election, and the Tories would lose them to Sir Keir’s party on swings of 5.9 percentage points, 3.9 points and 1.4 points respectively.Watford ranks at number nine on Labour’s target list, while Northampton North is 38th and Loughborough is 61st.(PA Graphics)Worcester has been a bellwether since 1979.At the 1997 general election, attracting the support of so-called “Worcester Woman” was considered by Labour to be vital for victory nationwide.At this election, Labour needs a swing of 6.7 points to take Worcester from the Conservatives, ranking it at number 70 on the party’s target list.Sir Keir held two campaign events in Worcester soon after the election was called.Two other seats have been bellwethers since 1979: Harrow East and Gloucester.Harrow East in north London would need a swing of 8.6 percentage points for Labour to gain it from the Conservatives, while Gloucester would need one of 9.7 points.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has twice visited Harrow East since the start of the election campaign.",What are the ‘bellwether’ seats at the General Election?,17,4

So far, seven officers have been identified.“One, a PC attached to the Royalty and Specialist Protection Command, was arrested on Monday June 17 on suspicion of misconduct in public office. The officer has been bailed and is subject to restricted duties.“A further six officers have been identified as having placed bets on the timing of the election.

It is now looking ever-more likely that Sir Keir Starmer will be prime minister by next Friday.Nigel Farage may yet have a good election night as Reform UK are currently in third place in the polls. The polling for the party has slipped following the controversy over Farage’s comments about the war in Ukraine but the party is still some five percentage points ahead of the Lib Dems.There was even further grim reading for the Tories on 26 June, when a separate poll conducted by Ipsos for the Evening Standard claimed that a record seven out of 10 Britons do not like the Conservative Party.Yahoo News UK summaries the positions of the parties according to five separate opinion polls.No major changes show Labour on course for large victoryA poll by Savanta puts Labour on 42% – 21 points ahead of the Tories, who are on 21%. Ipsos also puts Labour on 42%, compared to 19% for the Tories, while JL Partners give similar results, with Labour on 41% and the Tories on 25%.A Verian poll shows Labour on 38%, with the Tories on 21%, while Survation show Labour on 41%, compared to a historic low of 18% for the Tories.An average of opinion polls from February to June this year. (PA)An average of all polls with survey work completed during the seven days to 26 June puts Labour on 41%, 21 points ahead of the Conservatives on 20%, followed by Reform on 16%, the Lib Dems on 11% and the Greens on 6% – unchanged on the figures for the previous week.On 22 May, the day Sunak called the election, the seven-day averages stood at Labour 45%, Conservatives 23%, Reform 11%, Lib Dems 9% and Greens 6%.Tories could slump to lowest number of seatsEarlier this month, three major polls showed the Tories were on course for a historic defeat, with one projection showing the party potentially slumping to the lowest number of seats since the party was formed.Using the multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP) technique, which enables projections to be made at constituency level, YouGov's polling for Sky News projected Labour being on course to achieve a 200-seat majority. The poll suggested Labour would secure 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.The YouGov poll for Sky News.A More In Common UK poll for the News Agents podcast showed Labour projecting to finish on 406 seats, with the Conservatives on 155.Meanwhile, polling by Savanta and Electoral Calculus for the Telegraph, showed Sunak could become the first sitting prime minister to lose his seat of Richmond and Northallerton to Labour. It put Labour on 516 seats, with the Tories on just 53.What are the latest odds?As of 26 June, Oddschecker – a website which compares odds across different bookmakers – had Labour at 1/41 to win the most seats. To put that in context, this is seen as so likely that a £10 bet would return just £10.24.The Conservatives are 80/1 to win the most seats, a scenario seen as so unlikely that a £10 punt would return £810.A Conservative majority government is also seen as so unlikely (125/1) that Oddschecker sees a Reform UK government as more likely (100/1).What went wrong for the Tories?YouGov's voting intention tracker between January 2020 and June 2024. (YouGov)So, why have the polls changed so dramatically? It's worth looking back on an extremely eventful four-and-a-half years in UK politics.According to YouGov's voting intention tracker (see chart, above), Tory support peaked at 53%, with Labour on 32%, in April 2020, months after the party's stunning success in the 2019 general election and Boris Johnson's pledge to “get Brexit done”. That month also saw Starmer take over as Labour leader from Jeremy Corbyn.This was also amid a spirit of national unity following the onset of the COVID pandemic which nearly killed Johnson himself. The then-PM had been released from hospital five days before this particular survey was taken.Boris Johnson delivers his final speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street in September 2022. (AFP via Getty Images)Over the rest of the year, there was a downturn in support amid chaos over COVID rules, with the Tories falling as low as 35% in November 2020, compared to Labour on 40%.However, the UK’s successful COVID vaccination programme provided a pathway out of lockdown and with it, improved poll ratings. Tory support peaked at 41% in June 2021, with Labour at 30%.In October that year, there was a sense Johnson was untouchable. At the Tory party conference, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg remarked how the PM was ""in total command of his party, and politically dominant in the country"".But this fell apart quickly with the Partygate scandal, which emerged in November that year. Time and again, reports emerged of government and Tory staff – including Johnson – having taken part in lockdown-era social gatherings when their own COVID rules had prohibited them.By January 2022, Tory support had plummeted to 28%, with Labour on 38%. Johnson struggled on, but never recovered and a wave of ministerial resignations forced him to resign in July that year.The UK had three separate prime ministers – Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak – between 6 September and 24 October, 2022. (Getty Images)His successor, Liz Truss, then embarked on arguably the most disastrous prime ministerial reign in history, characterised by the catastrophic ""mini-budget"", containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, which prompted an economic crisis. Like Johnson, she lost the confidence of Tory MPs – and voters – and had to resign.Her 49-day spell as PM was the shortest in history, with Tory support plummeting to 19% (with Labour on 56%) the day after she announced her resignation in October 2022.Rishi Sunak, who had lost to Truss in the previous month's Tory leadership election, took over. However, as the above YouGov chart indicates, he has failed to cut through with voters. Tory support was at 23% two days after he assumed office, with the most recent survey, carried out on Thursday, showing support is now lower than under Truss at 18%.In short, the polls and odds, not to mention other factors such as notable by-election victories for Starmer's Labour, are pointing to a Labour government next week.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

387,"oilRishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer are destroying the offshore oil industry and undermining Britain’s energy security, a leading oil and gas company has said.David Latin, the chairman of Serica Energy, claimed that windfall taxes and political opposition had made Britain the most hostile country he had ever operated in outside of war zones.Mr Latin said: “I have been involved in this industry for more than 30 years and have worked all over the world.“Other than when I was responsible for a company which had significant assets in a war zone, I have never encountered a [political] situation which was so challenging when it comes to making investment decisions, and planning for the future more generally, as it is in the UK at present.”ADVERTISEMENTMr Latin said he was moving investments out of UK waters because the taxes and regulations imposed on the industry were too onerous and kept changing.State of constant uncertaintyHis comments, in a speech released in advance of Serica’s annual meeting today, were focused partly on the Conservative government, which first imposed a windfall tax in the spring of 2022, and later increased the rate and extended its duration.These multiple changes, said Mr Latin, left the industry in a state of constant uncertainty and destroyed investor confidence.Those problems were compounded by Labour, which has pledged to raise the tax again while also stripping the industry of the investment allowances should it be elected.Such allowances, which allow companies to offset investment against profit, are common to all businesses, so removing them from a single industry would set a major precedent.Mr Latin said that oil and gas producers already pay tax at an overall tax rate of 75pc, three times that charged to UK companies in other industries.He said: “This is despite the period of so-called “windfall” conditions for UK producers having long passed, with oil and gas prices having returned to historically normal levels.Story continues“Yet in the current general election, no reduction to match the circumstances is proposed by the Conservative Party and yet another increase in the tax rate to 78pc is proposed by the Labour Party.“Hydrocarbons are not intrinsically evil. They have allowed our civilisation to escape the bounds of subsistence.“Welcome alternatives are being developed but we – not least in the UK – will continue to depend on hydrocarbons for decades to come.“Surely it is better to produce these responsibly under world leading regulatory oversight in this country, with all the attendant benefits in jobs and tax revenues, than to import hydrocarbons which often arrive with a higher environmental and social cost than domestic production.”‘Jobs will be lost’Mr Latin warned that the policies and taxes imposed by UK politicians would rapidly lead to falling flows of oil and gas.He said: “Oil and gas continue to flow only when the main supply of investment stays open. Without it, the flow dries up. Even existing oil and gas fields decline and need continuous investment to maintain production.“Without investment fields will start to shut in and there will be a domino effect in the interconnected and interdependent UK North Sea infrastructure. …  Oil and gas consumption in the UK will be reduced not one iota, but UK jobs will be lost, imports increased, overall emissions raised, tax receipts for the Exchequer actually reduced, and the country’s security weakened.”He also warned that the recent Supreme Court decision requiring planning authorities to take account of downstream emissions in the approvals process for oil and gas fields would also drive the industry out of UK waters.Mr Latin said: “The choice is not between UK oil and gas or no oil and gas; the choice is UK oil and gas or foreign oil and gas. As was stated in the Supreme Court decision, emissions respect no borders.”","Sunak and Starmer undermining Britain’s energy security, says oil company",17,11

A frustrated interviewer.The PM responding to news Scotland Yard could interview candidates under caution within days pic.twitter.com/CngkuCwf70— Sam Coates Sky (@SamCoatesSky) June 27, 2024Rishi Sunak clashed with a Sky News journalist as he repeatedly dodged questions about the Tory betting scandal.The prime minister refused to say whether he had told one of the Conservative candidates under investigation by the Gambling Commission, Craig Williams, the date of the election before announcing it publicly.Williams was Sunak’s parliamentary aide and is one of his closest political allies.He and another candidate, Laura Saunders, were ditched by the party earlier this week over claims they put bets on the day of the election.On the campaign trail today, Sky News’ deputy political editor Sam Coates asked the PM: “Did you tell Craig Williams, a man you said you were with almost every minute of every day, the date of the election before he put the bet on?”Sunak replied: “Sam, I’ve been clear about this. I was furious when I learned about these allegations. We’ve initiated independent inquiries of our own because I don’t have access to the Gambling Commission’s detail.“We’ve suspended candidates. You’ll recognise, whilst there are ongoing independent investigations ... it’s just not right for me to say anything more about that.“But, if anyone has broken the rules, of course they should face the full consequences of the law and I’ll ensure that they’re booted out of the party.”Coates then said: “Prime minister, you know the answer to the question whether or not you told Craig Williams. You cannot prejudice an investigation, you can only prejudice a jury trial. You absolutely can answer this question.”The PM replied: “No it’s absolutely not right, while there are independent investigations that those aren’t compromised in any way, shape or form.”As Coates tried to challenge him Sunak continued: “They are rightly confidential and it’s important that they stay that way and that’s the right thing to do, and you know that.”Coates then hit back: “That is not true, you can only prejudice a jury trial. You know the answer of whether you told Craig Williams - yes or no?”Talking over the journalist, Sunak said: “We have done internal inquiries of our own, and as a result of those we have suspended candidates.“I’ve been clear that anyone who’s broken rules should face the full force of the law. I will ensure they are booted out of the party, and whilst there are ongoing, independent investigations, including by the police, it’s important that those matters are allowed to proceed properly.”Related...A Tory Candidate Has Been Accused Of Betting £8,000 That He Will Lose His SeatA Tory Candidate At The Centre Of A Betting Scandal Has Begged Voters To Stand By HimTory Party Drops Candidates Accused Of Betting On General Election Date",Rishi Sunak In Angry Clash With Sky News Journalist Over Tory Betting Scandal,17,3
202,"Rishi Sunak has refused to confirm whether he told a parliamentary aide the date of the election before he placed a bet on it.Two weeks ago, Craig Williams admitted he had a “flutter” on the election date. Mr Williams had been reselected by the Tories to contest Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr, which he won in 2019, before the party withdrew its support on Tuesday.During an election campaign visit to Derbyshire, Mr Sunak was asked repeatedly whether he had confided in Mr Williams ahead of his surprise announcement of a summer election.Speaking to broadcasters, the Prime Minister said: “I’ve been clear about this. I’m furious to have learnt about these allegations.“We’ve initiated independent inquiries of our own, because I don’t have access to the Gambling Commission’s detail. You’ll recognise that while there are ongoing independent investigations it’s just not right for me to say anything more about that.”Told he could not prejudice the investigation, Mr Sunak refused twice more to say whether he had told Mr Williams the election date.It came as Scotland Yard suggested Tory politicians could face police investigation over bets placed on the date of the general election.The Metropolitan Police is taking over part of the investigation and will assess whether any offences, such as misconduct in public office, have been committed.Detectives from the Met’s specialist crime command will determine what further investigation is required, a spokesman for the force said.Scotland Yard said the investigation would be split into two parts, with the Gambling Commission continuing to examine allegations of alleged cheating and the police focusing on whether any additional criminal offences had been committed.This could potentially include allegations of misconduct in public office against Conservative politicians who placed bets that Mr Sunak would call a July election.But the timing of the Met’s announcement has caused anger among Tory officials, who believe it could influence voters in the final week of campaigning.It also comes days after Scotland Yard was forced to deny reports in The Telegraph that it had been accused of leaking the identities of Conservatives implicated in the betting scandal.One serving Met officer, who is a member of Rishi Sunak’s close protection team, has already been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office.A further six officers have been identified as having placed bets on the timing of the election, but so far their cases are being investigated by the Gambling Commission.It is not clear how many people are being investigated over potential criminal offences, but Scotland Yard said the number was likely to be much smaller than those being looked into for alleged cheating.A Met spokesman said: “The Gambling Commission continues to review whether any bets placed on the timing of the general election will be within scope of either investigation.“The Met has compared the names of those who have placed bets on the timing of the election against a list of their officers. So far, seven officers have been identified.“One, a PC attached to the Royalty and Specialist Protection Command, was arrested on Monday June 17 on suspicion of misconduct in public office. The officer has been bailed and is subject to restricted duties.“A further six officers have been identified as having placed bets on the timing of the election. The Gambling Commission continues to investigate these matters, but the Met’s Directorate of Professional Standards is being kept informed.”Andrew Rhodes, the chief executive of the Gambling Commission, said: “We are focused on an investigation into confidential information being used to gain an unfair advantage when betting on the date of the general election.“Our enforcement team has made rapid progress so far, and will continue to work closely with the Metropolitan Police to draw this case to a just conclusion.“We understand the desire for information – however, to protect the integrity of the investigation and to ensure a fair and just outcome, we are unable to comment further at this time, including the name of any person who may be under suspicion.”Detective Superintendent Katherine Goodwin, who is leading the Met investigation, said: “We have agreed a joint approach with the Gambling Commission, who are the appropriate authority to investigate the majority of these allegations.“There will, however, be a small number of cases where a broader criminal investigation by the police is required. We will aim to provide updates at key points as our investigation progresses.”",Sunak refuses to confirm whether he told aide election date before bet,17,11
334,"The number of Metropolitan police officers under investigation over bets on the timing of the general election has risen to at least seven, the force has said.Britain’s biggest police force said it would continue to investigate a “small number” of wagers as part of a joint investigation led by the Gambling Commission.Sources familiar with the investigation suggested the decision to run parallel inquires could be an attempt to dampen the frenzy around MPs betting on themselves to win or lose their seats, which may be considered unwise but is not illegal.The Gambling Commission and the Met are focusing on whether the alleged use of confidential information constitutes cheating under criminal law.Six Met officers had already been caught up in the scandal, with one, a protection officer for the prime minister, under investigation for misconduct in public office after allegedly placing bets on the election date.The close protection officer has been bailed and is subject to restricted duties, the Met said.It confirmed that “at least” seven officers were under investigation by the Met’s specialist crime command.Related: Tory business minister bet on Conservatives winning electionIn a statement, the Met said the majority of cases – believed to be those without specific features that could mean additional offences apply – would be investigated by the Gambling Commission.The Guardian uncovered the gambling scandal two weeks ago, revealing that Craig Williams, Rishi Sunak’s closest aide, was the subject of an investigation by the Gambling Commission for betting that the election would be in July, three days before it was called.The watchdog is also examining bets allegedly placed by Tony Lee, the Conservative party’s campaigns director; his wife, Laura Saunders, the Tory candidate in Bristol North West; and Nick Mason, the Tories’ chief data officer.As many as 15 Conservative candidates and officials are believed to be under investigation over suspicious bets on the date of the election.The decision to drop Williams and Saunders as candidates on Tuesday was Sunak’s latest effort to draw a line under the gambling scandal that has dogged his election campaign.The Guardian also revealed that Russell George, a Tory member of the Welsh parliament who represents the same constituency as Craig Williams, is part of the commission’s inquiry.Andrew Rhodes, the chief executive of the Gambling Commission, said: “We are focused on an investigation into confidential information being used to gain an unfair advantage when betting on the date of the general election. Our enforcement team has made rapid progress so far and will continue to work closely with the Metropolitan police to draw this case to a just conclusion.”Det Supt Katherine Goodwin, who is leading the Met investigation, said: “We have agreed a joint approach with the Gambling Commission, who are the appropriate authority to investigate the majority of these allegations.

191,"Rishi Sunak has been branded “desperate” after the Conservatives released their latest shock election poster. The prime minister highlighted the attack advert, which depicts three people, including a child, with their hands in the air as if at gunpoint and urges voters not to ""surrender"" to Labour.The message is one the Prime Minister repeated more than a dozen times during his final head-to-head TV debate with Sir Keir Starmer on Wednesday.The Labour leader said during a campaign visit to Staffordshire that he was “surprised” by the use of the image.I will never stop fighting for this country. pic.twitter.com/jNB44Ct0at— Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak) June 27, 2024""This is really desperate stuff and I’m surprised by it,” he said. ""I think it underlines the difference between the two campaigns now.”Others also attacked the poster.Brendan Cox, who was married to murdered MP Jo Cox, tweeted: ""Labour are going to gun down your family. Don’t pretend you weren’t warned... Er...""The Tory leader defended the imagery during his on trip to Derbyshire, saying: ""This is an incredibly important election, and there’s an important choice for people. And I don’t want people to sleepwalk into something.”He said a Labour government “would be very damaging for our country.”And he again conceded that the public is “frustrated with me and our party, but this is not a by-election. This is a choice about our future, and that choice will have severe consequences for people’s financial security.""During the BBC debate Mr Sunak urged voters not to ""surrender"" to Labour’s tax, welfare and migration plans.Sunak has been branded ‘desperate’ (Getty Images)Earlier this month Crossbench peer Lord Carlile said the Conservatives ‘should be ashamed of themselves’ for publishing a photoshopped image of Sir Keir being cheered on by the North Korean despot Kim Jong Un.The advert was branded branded “shameful and demeaning” by the former Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation.Former Tory minister Alistair Burt also said the post was “disgraceful”.But Mr Sunak doubled down on the post, saying Sir Keir would send ""exactly the wrong message"" to the UK’s adversaries, such as Russia and North Korea.And he repeated his concerns of an ""axis of authoritarian states, including Russia, Iran, North Korea and China, who are increasingly acting together in a way that threatens our values, our interests and our security"".It was posted just a day after Sir Keir praised Mr Sunak’s cross-party approach on national security and defence issues.Mr Sunak has been under pressure from some of his cabinet to launch more personal attacks on Sir Keir in a bid to cut Labour’s massive poll lead.",Sunak accused of ‘desperate’ tactics with ‘don’t surrender to Labour’ poster of child with hands up,17,9
97,"John Swinney has fired the only decent shot he has left in his depleted general election armoury when he named the person who’s most to blame for all of Scotland’s ills.No, not Nicola Sturgeon, although there are plenty in the SNP who’d happily lay the blame at her door. Not even Alex Salmond or Humza Yousaf, respectively her predecessor and successor as first minister.No, it’s all down to the woman who he reckons all but destroyed Scotland 40 years ago: Margaret Thatcher.As an example of not just the politics of absurdity but also –  certainly in Mr Swinney’s and the SNP’s case – of the politics of desperation.Douglas Ross, the erstwhile Scottish Tory leader, delivered a litany of nationalist failures since 2007, which included the highest drug deaths in Europe, increased alcohol-linked deaths, massive NHS waiting lists and a life expectancy for Scots now less than it had been 17 years ago. He demanded Swinney stopped making independence his sole priority.But the First Minister responded by insisting that independence was the only solution to Tory-inspired austerity before reaching for his obviously carefully prepared coup de grace where he insisted: “We have to understand the consequences of the devastation wreaked on our country by the policies of Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative government.”To fall back on that tired and, frankly, lamebrained excuse that Maggie is to blame for everything that’s going wrong in Scotland, suggests that Swinney has been spending too much time poring over the latest opinion polls and trying to come up with an new excuse for the significant cull of his 48 MPs expected next Thursday.It was all about what Thatcher did to Scotland in the 1980s, which led to Ross describing as “absurd” the idea that everything that’s now wrong in Scotland was the result of policies adopted before he (Ross) had been born.He was born in 1983, four years after Thatcher became prime minister so I suppose, in Swinney’s eyes, that makes him one of “Maggie’s bairns” but his linking of Scotland’s current problems with, what is ancient political history, is a sure sign that Swinney is clutching at straws as July 4 draws ever nearer.While it’s true that Ross is a football referee and used to being blamed for all manner of wrong-doing it’s a bit much to link him with Maggie’s sins – real or imagined.In what was the last Question Time before Holyrood goes on holiday – sorry recess – Swinney was given a bruising from Anas Sarwar, the Labour leader. He reminded the First Minister of what must rank as one of the most embarrassing and, frankly, appalling episodes in the SNP’s oversight of the NHS,Because of long waiting times, some cancer patients in Scotland are actually paying for their own chemotherapy treatment. Sarwar said that the SNP had failed to meet the 62-day standard for cancer treatment for twelve years, meaning that almost 26, 000 cancer patients had waited too long.Cancer patients paying for their own treatment. Surely nothing sums up the SNP’s failure on the NHS than that. And it has absolutely nothing to do with Margaret Thatcher.",John Swinney blames Margaret Thatcher for Scotland’s woes in last desperate election shot,17,11
169,"Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer traded personal attacks in their final pre-general election debate, which was disrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters chanting outside the venue.The prime minister went on the offensive against the Labour leader on several occasions during the BBC live debate at Nottingham Trent University on Wednesday evening, repeatedly using the word “surrender”.But the opening minutes of their clash, hosted by BBC presenter Mishal Husain, were interrupted by the noise of a protest outside the building. Husain explained the noise to the audience by confirming a demonstration was taking place.The distraction did not stop the Conservative and Labour leaders from attacking each other on immigration, tax and welfare.A snap poll released by YouGov in the minutes after the debate concluded there was no clear winner, with both receiving 47% of the vote in a survey of 1,716 viewers, with 6% saying they did not know who was the victor.When asked what they thought of the BBC debate, 62% said they found it “frustrating” and 40% said it was “interesting”.Earlier, a poll by Electoral Calculus of 19,000 people forecast that Labour would win 650 seats in the House of Commons to the Conservatives’ 60, with the Liberal Democrats in second place on 71 and Reform UK on 18 seats.The debate ended in acrimonious fashion, with Starmer accusing Sunak of lying after the prime minister once again brought up the Conservatives’ claim, widely discredited, that a Labour government would mean people would pay £2,000 more in tax.Addressing the country, Sunak said: “Can you afford to pay at least £2,000 more in tax? If you’re not certain about Labour, don’t surrender to them, don’t vote for any other party, vote Conservative.”In response, Starmer said: “That is a lie, he’s been told not to repeat that lie and he’s just done it.”Husain raised the criticism directed at the spending plans of both men’s parties raised by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, saying the think tank accused them of “ignoring raw facts”.Perhaps the biggest cheer of the night was reserved for an audience member, Robert Blackstock, who criticised both men.He said Sunak had made a “fair job of being chancellor”, but is a “pretty mediocre prime minister”. He then said he believes Starmer’s “strings” are being pulled by senior members of the Labour Party.Blackstock asked: “Are you two really the best we’ve got to be prime minister of our great country?”Asked later about women's rights, both committed to protecting women’s rights to single-sex spaces, regardless of whether someone has a gender recognition certificate. Sunak said he seek to ""change the law, so that the old Equalities Act recognises that sex means biological sex"", while Starmer referenced an anti-trans joke made by Sunak in front of the mother of a murdered trans teenager.Sunak and Starmer also sparred on immigration, with Sunak claiming a new Labour trade deal with the EU would mean the free movement of people into the UK, accusing Starmer of “taking people for fools”.Starmer insisted: “We are not going back into the EU. We are not accepting freedom of movement. I’m not a defeatist like the prime minister.”The exchange came on the day Home Office figures revealed that more than 50,000 migrants have arrived in the UK after crossing the English Channel since Sunak became prime minister, including more than 13,000 this year.Starmer has been criticised for his comments on immigration during a debate hosted by The Sun newspaper earlier this week, in which he singled out Bangladesh, saying that “at the moment people coming from countries like Bangladesh are not being removed”.Sabina Akhtar, a Labour councillor in Stepney Green in London, resigned from the party on Wednesday in protest at his comments.Early in the debate, Starmer brought up Sunak’s fine for breaking COVID lockdown rules, and later he said the prime minister’s “lived world is millions of miles away” from millions of families in the UK. He also said Sunak was “out of touch”.Read a full account of the key moments of the debate, plus reactions:LIVE COVERAGE IS OVER41 updatesWed 26 June 2024 at 6:00 pm GMT-4Harriet SinclairHow well do BBC debate viewers think the leaders performed?This is how well (and badly) viewers thought the leaders performed in tonight's debate.How well or badly do BBC debate viewers think each leader performed?Rishi SunakWell: 56%Badly: 44%Keir StarmerWell: 61%Badly: 39%https://t.co/wjNCCLiyWP pic.twitter.com/3dECqu1N8c— YouGov (@YouGov) June 26, 2024Wed 26 June 2024 at 5:45 pm GMT-4Harriet Sinclair Starmer and Sunak clash over small boats and betting in final TV debate before polling dayRishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer clashed over migration and the betting scandal that has engulfed Westminster in their final televised head-to-head before polling day.The Prime Minster asked the Labour leader if he was planning to make a deal with the Taliban to send back asylum seekers rejected from the UK in a spiky exchange over the small boats crisis.Read the full story from the Evening Standard.Wed 26 June 2024 at 5:30 pm GMT-4Harriet Sinclair Combative, energetic, passionate – where has this Rishi been until now?If the Tories don’t knock a chunk out of Labour’s lead after Rishi Sunak’s terrier-like performance in the BBC debate, it won’t be for lack of trying.Unlike England’s footballers, Mr Sunak gave it everything he had to expose the Labour leader’s weaknesses on tax, migration and women’s rights.He also had a new word for voting Labour: surrender.Read the full story from The Telegraph.Wed 26 June 2024 at 5:08 pm GMT-4Harriet Sinclair Key moments from BBC’s head-to-head election debate between Starmer and SunakRishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer have faced off in the final televised head-to-head clash of the General Election campaign.The BBC debate, hosted by Mishal Husain, saw the Tory and Labour leaders grilled about their positions on a variety of issues, including migration, welfare and the gambling scandal which has emerged in the middle of the election campaign.Read the full story from PA.Wed 26 June 2024 at 4:53 pm GMT-4Harriet SinclairConservative voters overwhelmingly find Sunak the winnerThe large majority of Tory voters thought Sunak won the debate.Conservative 2019 voters who viewed the #BBCdebate think Sunak won by 82% to 18%https://t.co/wjNCCLiyWP pic.twitter.com/xe8eWvhX3E— YouGov (@YouGov) June 26, 2024Wed 26 June 2024 at 4:50 pm GMT-4Harriet Sinclair Who won the BBC general election TV debate?

Mark my words your taxes are going to go up under a Labour government.""Keir Starmer responded: ""False. Liz Truss tried that experiment on the country. Rishi Sunak said we should unite behind her.

I think that in the last 14 years politics has become too much about self entitlement, and MPs thinking about what they could get for themselves.”He added: “The instinct of these people to think the first thing they should do is try to make money, that was the wrong instinct, and we have to change that.”Starmer continued: “What I did, when one of my team was alleged to have been involved and investigated by the Gambling Commission, they were suspended within minutes, because I knew it made it really important to be swift, the Prime Minister delayed and delayed and delayed until eventually he was bullied into taking off.”In response, Sunak said: “It was important to me, that given the seriousness and the sensitivity of the matters at hand that they were dealt with properly, and that’s what I’ve done.”Wed 26 June 2024 at 3:16 pm GMT-4Harriet SinclairThe debate beginsThe final showdown between Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer has begun.Wed 26 June 2024 at 3:15 pm GMT-4Harriet SinclairLib Dems air election broadcast ahead of the debateEd Davey spoke movingly about his mother.

311,"The Metropolitan Police has been dragged - reluctantly, as I understand it - into investigating candidates a week out from the election. Even 24 hours ago this was not the case - Scotland Yard wanted to take care of their own - the officers probed by the Gambling Commission - and no more.Election latest: Farage responds to Reform campaigner commentsBut as the days have dragged on, it's clear the issue has become more complex, and now gone beyond the scope of the Gambling Commission.What has changed is a realisation by investigating authorities that they need to look into whether some candidates may have broken the law on misconduct in public office.This is beyond the remit of the Gambling Commission, which began the initial probe, and now falls to the police.This means the prospect of mainly Conservative candidates, including the prime minister's closest aide, potentially being interviewed under caution, maybe even this side of election day.Read moreSunak's senior adviser interviewed over bettingStarmer says Sunak 'bullied' into action on gamblingFinal TV debate leaves viewers largely uninspiredYou could see how tetchy the subject made Rishi Sunak in the interview with the broadcast pool earlier today.His reluctance to give more details about his conversations with Craig Williams, who was his link man with a fractious, rebellious parliamentary party, spoke volumes.The prime minister will argue he has been told by the Gambling Commission not to comment, and as PM, commenting on police inquiries could be seen to jeopardise their operational independence.However, Sir Keir Starmer and Labour defied Gambling Commission instructions to keep quiet about the investigation into one of their candidates.There is no confirmation of an active police investigation into Mr Williams specifically.With seven days until the election, the voters in his former Montgomeryshire constituency may feel they have a right to know the full facts before polling day.After the high of Wednesday's debate for Mr Sunak, the endless repercussions of the gambling scandal are clouding what could be his final few days in office.",Rishi Sunak's tetchiness over betting scandal speaks volumes,17,5
320,"The UK's exit from recession during the first three months of the year was stronger than initial figures suggested, according to official data.In an update on its first growth estimate, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.7% between January and March.It had originally said on 10 May that output was 0.6% up on the previous three months - a positive figure that brought to an end the shallow recession that struck during the second half of 2023.Then, the effects of Bank of England interest rate rises to combat inflation were widely blamed by economists for choking off demand.Money latest:Former Bank of England rate-setter sees cut ahead this summerAll the growth during the January-March period was attributable to the services sector, which accounts for almost 80% of the economy.We have since learned there was zero growth recorded by the ONS for the month of April, with poor weather hitting construction and high streets.The data is the last from the ONS before the country goes to the polls on 4 July - with the economy, and personal finances especially, among the topics high on voters' minds following the effects of the COVID pandemic and energy-driven cost of living crisis.The timing of the general election has coincided with fierce debate over whether the Bank should now be cutting interest rates, allowing for an easing in borrowing costs.At its last policy meeting just over a week ago, the rate-setting committee voted 7-2 to maintain Bank rate at 5.25%.The minutes of the meeting betrayed continuing worries about the pace of wage growth and stubborn inflation within services.The Bank fears that a rate rise, at this stage, risks fuelling price growth further as basic salaries grow at a pace of 6%.The rate of inflation is currently back at its 2% target for the first time in three years.Despite this gap in favour of consumers, with wage growth outpacing inflation since June last year, the effects of the crises since 2020 have taken their toll, according to campaigners on living standards.The Resolution Foundation said on Friday real household disposable incomes were lower in early 2024 than they were back in late 2019.It said growth so far in this parliament was weaker than all but two parliaments since 1910, despite growth over the past year of 2.4%.The thinktank declared average incomes were £120 a year lower per person over the period since the last election.Figures such as this get to the heart of the election campaign amid criticism of the main parties' lack of clarity over their tax and spending commitments.But they also give ammunition to critics of the Bank of England who argue interest rates should come down.Read more:Manifesto checker: What are all the parties' pledges?A very simple guide to what each party is promisingIn its financial stability report on Thursday, there was a further nod to pressures ahead as it warned there were still three million mortgage holders yet to feel the pain of higher interest rates in their repayments.As things stand, financial markets and economists see August or September as the likely months for the first rate cut, barring any new shocks.For many, the prospect of action in June was largely eradicated by the election - the Bank anxious to avoid any questions over its independence.","Exit from recession was stronger than first thought, official figures show",18,5

They will no longer be with the campaign.“The appalling sentiments expressed by some in these exchanges bear no relation to my own views, those of the vast majority of our supporters or Reform UK policy.

247,"Since May 2023, voters across the UK have been asked to show a form of photographic ID at their local ballot box.The requirement draws on the recommendations of a 2016 report by Lord Pickles, the former communities secretary, which warned there was a risk of “significant abuse” in the electoral system if people could vote under false pretences with little risk of detection.As Labour continues to hold a lead of around 20 percentage points in the latest election opinion polls, The Telegraph sets out everything you need to know about voting rules ahead of the general election on July 4.Here are the acceptable forms of identification you can bring to vote for an election candidate. Read the latest election pollsFollow The Telegraph’s general election live coverageWhat are the voter ID requirements?Everyone wanting to vote in the UK must produce photo ID to take part in certain elections.For voters in England, Scotland and Wales, this includes UK parliamentary elections, by-elections and recall petitions. Those in England also need their ID for local elections.The requirement does not apply to Holyrood, Senedd or council elections in Scotland and Wales. People in Northern Ireland already needed photo ID to vote, so the rule change does not affect them.Voters in both England and Wales also need ID for police and crime commissioner elections.The rule has been applied in stages, beginning with the local elections in England on May 4 2023. This year’s general election will be the first time ID is required for a national poll.The change marks a significant departure from the previous system in most of the UK, where voters only had to verbally confirm their name and address.What types of ID are accepted?Voters are required to show one form of photo ID at the polls, and it does not need to be in date so long as it is recognisable as the person at the ballot box.However, it must be the original version – not a photocopy – and the name on the ID should be the same as it appears on the electoral register.Acceptable forms of voter ID include:Passport issued by the UK, any of the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, a British Overseas Territory, an EEA state or a Commonwealth country (including an Irish Passport Card)Full or provisional driving licence issued by the UK, any of the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, or an EEA stateA Blue BadgeAny identity card bearing the Pass (Proof of Age Standards Scheme) hologramAny of the following travel passes:Older person’s bus pass funded by the GovernmentDisabled person’s bus pass funded by the GovernmentOyster 60+ card funded by the GovernmentFreedom passScottish national entitlement card issued for the purpose of concessionary travel (including a 60+, disabled or under 22s bus pass)60 and over Welsh concessionary travel cardDisabled person’s Welsh concessionary travel cardSenior SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandRegistered blind SmartPass or blind person’s SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandWar disablement SmartPass issued in Northern Ireland60+ SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandHalf fare SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandAny of these government-issued documents:Biometric immigration documentMinistry of Defence Form 90 (Defence Identity Card)National identity card issued by an EEA stateElectoral identity card issued in Northern IrelandVoter authority certificateAnonymous elector’s documentDo the rules apply to postal votes?No. You do not need to have any form of photo ID to vote by post.The deadline to apply for a postal vote was 5pm on June 19 in England, Scotland and Wales, with June 15 the limit in Northern Ireland.However, those who applied on time were asked to provide your National Insurance (NI) number to verify their identity. If you were not able to do this, you will need to explain why.Those who registered in time will automatically be sent their postal ballot and are advised to fill out the forms and post them back for free as soon as they can.There is no formal deadline for this but leaving it too close to polling day may mean your vote could not be delivered in time to be counted.How can I get a voter ID card?The deadline to apply for a VAC passed on June 26 at 5pm.Those who applied on time will receive a voter authority certificate (VAC) either online or by post. To complete the application, a recent digital photo of yourself and your NI number was required.For those without an NI number, it was possible to provide alternative documents as proof of identity, such as a birth certificate, a bank statement or utility bill.What if I do not have a valid ID?Anyone without a form of ID that fits the requirements was still able to apply for a VAC, but must have done so before the 5pm deadline on June 26.This is not a substitute to registering for vote, which must have been done in advance of any application.Why was voter ID introduced?The aim was to stamp out voter fraud by forcing people to prove their identity at the polls.In his Government-commissioned report, Lord Pickles warned that the authorities were in a “state of denial” and “turning a blind eye” to the problem of electoral fraud.Why is voter ID so controversial?The Government has said the change is necessary to curb the “inexcusable potential” for “stealing someone’s vote” by simply quoting their name and address at the ballot box.However, critics say actual claims of electoral fraud are very rare in the UK.In 2019, the last general election year, there were only 33 allegations of impersonation at the polling station out of more than 58 million votes cast, according to the Electoral Reform Society.Opponents of the rule have also warned it will make it more difficult for certain people to vote, including the disabled, transgender and non-binary people, and black and ethnic minority groups.",The photo ID you need to vote in UK elections,18,11
20,"A leading pollster has warned that defeat for the Tories in the general election next week is now unavoidable and the only question remaining is how much Rishi Sunak’s party loses by.The assessment by Techne UK’s chief executive Michela Morizzo - Italy’s equivalent of Professor Sir John Curtice - comes as her company’s tracker poll for The Independent shows that Labour goo into the final seven-day stretch with a 22 point lead over the Tories.Labour are on 41 per cent (down one) with the Tories languishing on 19 per cent for a third week in a row and Reform UK just two points behind still on 17 per cent. The Lib Dems are on 12 per cent and Greens on 5 per cent meaning that the five main parties almost completely unchanged from last week.Rishi Sunak has been mentioned in barely 1% of the Conservatives’ online adverts (Phil Noble/PA) (PA Wire)It means that the final onslaught unleashed by Rishi Sunak in the head-to-head debate on Wednesday attacking Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer on tax and immigration had almost no impact,, the same as most of his tactics throughout a problematic campaign.Instead, the Tories continue to be dogged by their own self inflicted wounds particularly the gambling scandal and before that Mr Sunak leaving the D-Day commemorations early.Ms Morizzo now believes that there is nothing he can do to turn things around in such a small space of time.She told The Independent: “With less than one full week before the British electorate go to the general election ballot boxes our regular tracker poll of Westminster voting intentions confirms what we have known now for sometime. There continues to be no closing of any gap between Labour and Conservatives continuing at a 22 per cent Labour lead.“If this wasn’t bad enough though for the Conservatives the steady rise of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK throughout the campaign to its position now 17 percent points of national vote - a rise of four to five polling points across the last four weeks will further squeeze and damage the Conservatives already faltering chances.“There can be no doubt that the data shows clearly it is now too late to save the Conservatives - the election is lost for them, the only question is how great this loss will ultimately be. Abstention rate and Reform UK voters will make the difference!”To underline the point, Electoral Calculus predicts that if this poll was the result of an election Labour would have a majority of 268, the Lib Dems would be the official oppposition with 75 seats, the Tories stranded in third with 48 seats and Reform on a stunning 19 seats.The breakdown of the data continues to make depressing reading for the Tories. For a third week in a row Leave voters from 2016 are more likely to vote Reform than Conservative by 28 per cent to 22 percent.Less than four in 10 (38 per cent) of the Tory voters from 2019 have stuck with the party now, while Labour leads in every age, education and socio-economic category.In a sign that voters are despondent about the choices as many as a third (33 per cent) may not vote with 24 per cent deciding not to cast their vote and another 9 per cent uncertain.",Pollster warns only one election question to be answered: ‘How big is the Tory loss?’,18,9
185,"Rishi Sunak has announced a general election for July 4, as the country prepares for its first national vote since 2019.Here, The Telegraph examines the processes involved, including how votes are called and who can take part.When is the general election?Why is there an election now?What happens after the general election?Why was the general election not on the same day as the local elections?What happens next?How are general elections called?How often are elections called?Who can vote in the general election?When should I register to vote?When will polling take place?When is the general election?The general election will take place on July 4 as the country heads to the polls between 7am and 10pm to have their say on the next prime minister. It had looked likely that Rishi Sunak would wait until the autumn to call the next election, but the Prime Minister announced in a rain-sodden speech outside of Downing Street on May 22 that July 4 was the chosen date.Read the latest election pollsFollow The Telegraph’s live general election coverageMany assumed Mr Sunak would want more time for the new Rwanda deterrent and recent tax cuts to take effect, having described a ballot in the second half of the year as his “working assumption”.But speculation reached fever pitch in Westminster when the Conservatives refused to rule out an election being called that day. That afternoon, an umbrella-less Mr Sunak announced his snap election decision and set in motion the vote to happen six weeks later on July 4.The choice means that Mr Sunak will have been in No 10 for 618 days by the polling date and has been called a “mistake” by figures like Prof Sir John Curtice, the polling expert.Why is there an election now?Tory figures close to general election planning had also been working under the assumption there was not going to be a summer ballot, but that all changed on May 22.Lord Cameron cut a trip to Albania short in order to return to a Cabinet meeting and Grant Shapps delayed a flight to a Nato meeting two hours to be there.On the day of the announcement, news came that the rate of inflation had fallen even further than expected, which Mr Sunak hailed as a sign that “everything is heading in the right direction”.With the Government’s record perhaps at its strongest on the economy, the Prime Minister was keen to use the news as a launchpad for triggering the election – but what else played into his decision?Key factors for the Prime Minister would have included whether economic statistics was continuing to improve, and whether polling and focus group research suggested that voters were feeling the positive effects of the National Insurance cuts, crediting the Tories for the boost.Getting Rwanda deportation flights off the ground also strengthened the case for going to the polls in the summer, along with a steady decline in the NHS elective waiting list.It had been rumoured that figures in Downing Street were mulling over whether it would be in the Tories’ interests to trigger a ballot sooner rather than later, despite being way behind Labour in the polls.What happens after the general election?Polls will close at 10pm on July 4.Shortly afterwards, the BBC will publish its exit poll of voters in approximately 150 constituencies around England, Scotland and Wales. This provides an indication of who will win once all the ballots have been counted.Over the course of the night, votes are tallied up and the winners of each constituency are announced.If the Conservatives retain a majority in the new Parliament, the party will continue in office and resume normal business.But if Labour or another party wins a clear majority, the Prime Minister and his Cabinet will resign and the King will invite the winning party’s leader to form a new Government.In the case of a hung Parliament, where no single party has a majority, Mr Sunak will remain in power and be given the chance to form a government.The Prime Minister could negotiate with other parties to form a coalition, govern as a minority, negotiate a confidence and supply deal with another party, or resign.In the case of his resignation, the leader of the largest opposition party would be invited to form a government as a minority administration or in coalition with another party.The state opening of Parliament will be Wednesday July 17, with summer recess due to start on July 23 and not ending until September.It has been reported that Sir Keir Starmer plans to delay or cut short recess in a bid to get on with his legislative agenda, in the event of a Labour victory.On July 18, the new Prime Minister will host 50 Nato leaders at Blenheim Palace for a key alliance summit.It will be a key moment to show themselves to the world as Britain’s new leader.Why was the general election not on the same day as the local elections?The general election could have been called on May 2 – the same day as the locals – but Mr Sunak made the decision to avoid a spring poll.The Institute for Government pointed out that a spring election would avoid the risk that “a heavy defeat in the local elections could increase pressure on the Prime Minister – including from within his party – and make it difficult to regain momentum ahead of an election that would by then be less than a year away”.However, that opportunity passed. On March 14, the Prime Minister ruled out a national ballot on May 2, confirming there “won’t be a general election on that day”.It was thought that heavy losses at the locals could tempt restless Tory MPs to mount a challenge against their leader.However, despite a dire set of results for the Conservatives, resulting in hundreds of council seats lost, the rebels appeared to back off.What happens next? Following Mr Sunak’s announcement on May 22, Parliament was prorogued and dissolved eight days later on May 30 after the Prime Minister was granted permission by the King.Prorogation happened on May 24, in line with the 2022 Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act that sets out polling day to take place 25 working days following the dissolution on May 30, landing the general election on July 4.Election candidates use the six-week lead up to ballot day to campaign for their parties.Mr Sunak, Sir Keir Starmer and many other political figures have been campaigning up and down the country. They have also taken part in TV election debates in a bid to win over voters and released their 2024 party manifestos, starting with the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives. It is up to each party when to publish its manifesto, but an analysis by the Institute for Government shows that all Labour and Conservative manifestos since 1997 have been launched between 18 and 29 days before the election.How are general elections called?It is up to the Prime Minister to decide when to hold a national vote, but this power has only been restored in recent years.In 2011, the Fixed Term Parliaments Act effectively put the House of Commons in charge, with general elections held every five years unless a majority of MPs willed it otherwise.For an election to be called early, two thirds of the House had to back the plans. This is how Theresa May’s snap election was triggered in 2017. Alternatively, MPs could spark a ballot by passing a vote of no confidence in the Government.After trying and failing three times to secure the necessary two thirds majority for an early vote in 2019, the Tories opted to circumvent the law with a new purpose-built piece of legislation – the Early Parliamentary General Election Act – which required only a simple majority to pass. This paved the way for Boris Johnson’s snap election in 2019.The Government went on to repeal the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, replacing it with the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act. This new law stripped the Commons of its power to block an early ballot, putting the Prime Minister back in control.Traditionally, the Prime Minister travels to Buckingham Palace to request the dissolution of Parliament, before returning to Downing Street to announce the forthcoming election.How often are elections called? Each Parliament must be dissolved for a general election by the fifth anniversary of the day it first met.This measure was passed under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act by the 2011 coalition government, which set in stone the five-year periods between general elections.Elections may be held earlier – such occurred in 2017 with Theresa May and 2019 by Mr Johnson following a Brexit deadlock – under special circumstances.However, local elections such as the May 2024 by-elections and mayoral elections operate on a different time scale. Who can vote in the general election?The vast majority of UK adults can vote in a general election.In order to vote, you must:be registered to votebe 18 or over on the day of the election (‘polling day’)be a British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizenbe a resident at an address in the UK or Gibraltar, or living abroad and registered as an overseas voter (it is also possible to register if you have no fixed address)not be legally excluded from voting (for example, if you are serving a prison sentence)When should I register to vote?The deadline for registering to vote has now passed. Registration usually stays open until midnight at the end of the 12th working day before polling day, meaning the window closed on June 18 at 11.59pm. The deadline to vote by post passed the following day at 5pm.The deadline to apply for proxy vote also passed on June 26.When will polling take place?Parliament was dissolved a few days after the election announcement and polling day takes place 25 working days after that.The Civil Service has entered “purdah” – the period between an election being called and polling day – which involves strict restrictions on the work of officials to ensure that Whitehall resources are not being used to benefit any party in particular.",When is the general election?

165,"Reform blames immigration and Labour blames the Tories – but what is really to blame for the struggle young people now face to buy a home?Sir Keir Starmer seems confident that his party can end the nation’s house price crisis and help more of us realise the dream of homeownership. But I suspect a generation of would-be first-time buyers will be deeply disappointed.The last time that Labour won a landslide victory in 1997, house prices proceeded to rocket – soaring 152pc while Tony Blair was in Number 10, according to analysis by estate agents Savills.In contrast, house price growth has been relatively modest under the Tories – rising 8pc under David Cameron, dropping 1pc under Theresa May, increasing 10pc under Boris Johnson and falling 8pc under Rishi Sunak.House prices had tanked under John Major, then interest rates finally started to fall under New Labour. This encouraged buyers and investors to spend more, and banks to lend more.House prices boomed, and so too did buy-to-let. It was at this point that the house price crisis began, like a runaway train.It looks very likely Sir Keir will also inherit an economy in recovery next month. Interest rates will start to fall this year and things could again start to look rosy very quickly – property prices included. House prices have proved remarkably resilient, surviving the recent mortgage rate squeeze. Surely, the only way is up?But this is news Labour won’t want to hear. It wants to make homes more affordable for buyers and has pledged to boost supply, saying it will build more homes and ensure more of them are allocated as affordable housing. It will also bring back mandatory building targets for local councils, put more resources into planning and free up more green belt land.Although, Labour, of course, won’t be building any homes. It faces the same challenges as the Tories, and its policies aren’t much different from theirs either. Neither can it compel developers to build any.For housing supply to increase, the nation’s housebuilders need to have real incentive. They aren’t going to lay a single brick until they know they can make money.Data this week revealed that since 2015, planning permission has been granted for one million homes that still have not been built. Developers sit on land and eke out homes, controlling their supply to maximise profits.Britain is also facing a skills shortage. Homes are increasingly expensive to construct and there aren’t enough people qualified to build them.There are surprisingly few ways that governments can help buyers by increasing supply and cooling house price growth. So if Labour cannot build more homes, what can it do?The only thing that is really in its power is to meddle with taxes. With Labour’s manifesto scant on detail, imaginations are running wild as to what the party might choose to do if it secures a “supermajority” next week.Any raid on capital gains or stamp duty will deter owners from selling and shut yet more buyers out of the market. The best thing Labour can do is steer well clear of any interference in taxes which will clog the market.Labour wants to appease the younger generation who believe it’s the Tories’ fault they can’t buy a house. The reality is that governments have little to no control over house prices.Whichever strings they pull, they will always be dictated by economic forces – and whatever buyers are willing and able to pay.If wages increase, so will house prices. If stamp duty is cut, this will be priced in. If mortgage affordability improves, buyers will simply stretch themselves further.If Labour, as it says, wants to be the party of wealth creation, it will have to accept that that means house prices will have to keep on rising.",Blair caused Britain’s house price crisis – and Starmer will be no better,18,11
355,"Tory minister Steve Baker will mount a bid to replace Rishi Sunak as party leader should he lead the Conservatives to defeat on July 4 as expected, it is understood.The Northern Ireland minister hinted at a leadership run if he retains his Wycombe seat – where he was re-elected with a slim 4,214 majority in 2019 – at the General Election.He told the PA news agency: “One thing at a time. I want to represent the people of Wycombe the best that I can, as I always have done.“Then let’s see what happens.”🙏Obviously it’s a difficult election, but the reaction on the doorstep has certainly been more positive than the polls would suggest.👉""Something is going on which is bigger than Brexit in the UK, the Conservative Party. That thing, I believe, is the collapse of the…— Rt Hon Steve Baker FRSA 🗽 (@SteveBakerFRSA) June 27, 2024It is understood that he will announce his intentions if the electoral hammering the polls are predicting occurs and Mr Sunak is forced to give up the party’s reins.Mr Baker joins other hopefuls – including Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch and Home Secretary James Cleverly – in jostling for the position with a week to go until polling day.Labour said the manoeuvring showed the Tories were putting “their self-interest and leadership ambitions first”.The contest to pick Mr Sunak’s successor could shape the party for years to come as right-wingers and more centrist Tories battle it out.Security minister Tom Tugendhat on Thursday twice refused to rule out taking a tilt at the top job, when asked in an ITV interview.Seen as being on the moderate wing of the party, he previously ran for the leadership in 2022.Mr Baker cited his experience leading Tory Brexit, Covid-19 lockdowns and net zero rebellions as reasons he would be a suitable candidate.He told HuffPost UK: “It’s a fact my colleagues sent for me four times to provide leadership through crisis to success: before and after the referendum, in Covid and in relation to the cost of net zero.”Earlier this week, he admitted the Tories’ election campaign has gone “badly” and that its double-digit poll deficit is “extremely worrying”.He said “things have gone wrong” for the party and that he is standing for re-election to try to “sort this mess out”.Mr Baker also complained that the Prime Minister “didn’t consult me” on calling a summer election.After Mr Sunak surprised Westminster by announcing the July 4 poll in May, Mr Baker went ahead with a holiday in Greece rather than campaigning in his constituency.The Tory campaign has in recent days been overshadowed by the row over the alleged use of inside information to bet on the timing of the July 4 poll, dampening Mr Sunak’s hopes of putting a dent in Labour’s 21-point average poll lead.Mr Baker was the first serving minister to call for those who placed bets on the election date to be suspended by the party, with the Prime Minister later pulling support from candidates Craig Williams and Laura Saunders.Asked whether he wanted to be part of the battle for the soul of the Conservative Party, Mr Baker told Times Radio on Tuesday: “That’s why I’m standing.“I’ve said to numerous people on their doorstep that … I recognise things have gone wrong and that I would love to have the opportunity to rise to their expectations of giving them the Conservative Party and the Conservative government which they expect. Pragmatic, professional and yet principled…“I would very much like to have the chance to sort this mess out.”Tory MPs usually vote to select the top two candidates, who are then put forward to the party membership, although the rules and timeline of the race would be set out by the backbench 1922 Committee.Mr Baker was first elected to represent Wycombe in 2010 but faces a tough contest to keep his seat next week.Labour’s deputy national campaign co-ordinator Ellie Reeves said: “While the Tories put their self-interest and leadership ambitions first, it’s clearer than ever: if the Conservatives are given another five years, the chaos will just continue.“This changed Labour Party is ready to serve the British people – country first, party second. The public has the chance for change with Labour if they vote for it on July 4.”",Steve Baker to launch Tory leadership bid if party loses and he keeps seat,17,4
261,"Sir Keir Starmer has condemned as “desperate” a Tory attack advert depicting people with their hands up and urging voters not to “surrender” to Labour.The Labour leader also said he was “genuinely disappointed” Rishi Sunak “resorted to lies” about his party’s tax plans.The Prime Minister shared a poster on X showing a picture of a man, woman and child holding their hands in the air as if at gunpoint.The text on the image reads “don’t surrender your family’s future to Labour”, doubling down on a warning issued by Mr Sunak repeatedly during his final head-to-head TV debate with Sir Keir.The Labour leader told reporters during a campaign visit to Staffordshire on Thursday: “This is really desperate stuff and I’m surprised by it.“I think it underlines the difference between the two campaigns now. They are running a very negative campaign, nothing about the future of the country.“I’m very happy to be the candidate going into the final week who is putting forward a more positive case for the change the country needs.”I will never stop fighting for this country. pic.twitter.com/jNB44Ct0at— Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak) June 27, 2024Mr Sunak urged voters not to “surrender” to Labour’s tax, welfare and migration plans more than a dozen times in Wednesday night’s heated BBC exchange.He also reiterated the much-disputed claim that a Labour government would hike taxes by £2,000 per household.Sir Keir told Channel 5 News: “I’m disappointed that happened in the debate. I’m genuinely disappointed that the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom resorted to lies. I just don’t think that should happen.”He said the TV showdown had been “fiery”, but insisted “I’m not motivated by personal animosity (towards Mr Sunak) in the slightest”.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on a campaign visit to Denby Pottery Factory, Ripley (Joe Giddens/PA)The Prime Minister defended the latest Conservative campaign advert when challenged over its controversial imagery.He told broadcasters in Derbyshire: “This is an incredibly important election, and there’s an important choice for people.

This is a choice about our future, and that choice will have severe consequences for people’s financial security.”But the poster drew criticism online.Brendan Cox, who was married to murdered MP Jo Cox, tweeted: “Labour are going to gun down your family.

51,"Even during a general election campaign with projections of historic – even unprecedented – results, people cannot always be relied upon to give their full attention.“We met a guy who said he was going to vote Labour but wouldn’t now because he had just heard that we were taxing condoms,” said Labour’s Karl Turner, who was first voted in as the MP for Hull East in 2010 and is standing for re-election this time.“I said, ‘condoms?’ ‘Yeah,’ he said: ‘I just heard on that [pointing to the TV] that you are taxing condoms, and I’m not having it. You’re not getting my vote.’ It was Terence [Turner’s parliamentary assistant] here who worked it out.“‘We’re taxing non-doms, not condoms,’ I said. ‘Oh,’ he said. ‘Like the prime minister’s wife? Ah.’ He calls out: ‘Margaret: they’re taxing non-doms, not condoms.’”It was one vote saved for Labour in East Yorkshire – but as the general election moves from what observers have described as the “air war”, where messaging is all-important, to the “ground war”, where mobilising the voters to actually visit the ballot box is key, it is the significant tranche of voters who have entirely switched off that worries Turner.Hull East was the only constituency at the last general election where under half (49.3%) of the electorate turned out to vote. Within Turner’s constituency is the ward of Marfleet, which has a strong claim to be the most politically disillusioned place in Britain. Turnout was 11.6% in the last local elections.Disillusionment and distrust when it comes to politics and politicians is a UK-wide phenomenon, and is strong in Hull East.On Monday, the retired women at the Marfleet community centre were having an afternoon researching their family histories on laptops. “They don’t give a damn about the people below ’em,” said Lesley Robinson, a retired personal assistant. “What’s the point? They all lie.”“They tell you what they think you want to know – they treat us as stupid,” added Sue Hurst, 78. “You are born in hope and die in despair.” Robinson agreed, interjecting: “They treat us like children or worse than that. At least children get pocket money.”Pauline French, 70, who retired last year as the cleaner at the centre, puffed out her cheeks. “I will, but my husband and son won’t vote,” she said. “People just don’t bother.”It is not that the people here don’t have problems. Marfleet is one of the most socially disadvantaged places in a city with plenty of issues, but there is a complete absence of belief that anyone is going to do anything about it.A focus group of non-voters in the city, carried out by More In Common for the Guardian, offers further evidence of the depth of those feelings.“I work for the NHS so nothing good comes out of elections for me … no one cares,” said Hameder, a trainee nurse.Michael, a service engineer, described politicians as “brainless monkeys”. Sam, who is hoping to start an apprenticeship, explained she felt bad sometimes about not taking an interest in politics and that her friends told her off for it, but that it was hard when “everything does feel in so much disrepair … Everyone just hates politics and hates Rishi Sunak.”The immediate concern for Labour beyond Hull is that, with Keir Starmer’s party so far ahead in the polls, the apathetic will be joined by many more who will assume there is little point in voting given the apparent certainty of the result.It is a nagging doubt in Labour HQ that new polling from More in Common polling will do little to assuage.Rather than asking individuals about their own engagement with politics, which people often overstate, respondents were asked about their friends and family.Questioned as to whether their friends and family were more excited or more apathetic about the election, Britons were almost three times more likely to say apathetic. Asked if their friends and family thought the general election would make a meaningful difference to the country, barely a quarter (26%) agreed.Most starkly, 41% said family and friends were more disillusioned with this general election compared with previous ones, while only 7% said they were less disillusioned.Voter turnout is a Hull-wide problem. Three out of the four constituencies with the lowest turnout in 2019 were Hull seats, with the other being Chorley, where the Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, stood unopposed.Turner was born and bred in the constituency and is regarded locally as someone who cares, but it is difficult not to take the turnout figures personally at times.Speaking from his constituency office, located between a branch of Pizza Mafia and the Witham Tandoori, the 53-year-old said: “I was on a doorstep the other day and the guy said: ‘I won’t be voting Labour.’ I said: ‘Oh, why is that?’ ‘It’s because I don’t like you.’ ‘Oh right,’ I said. ‘That’s very honest of you. That’s what my wife says as well’.“As I was walking down the path, he said: ‘I thought you would come out with a fucking clever line.’ I said: ‘May I ask you how you will vote, for my data?’ He said: ‘I’m going to sit down and work out which bastard can stop you.’ He then said, real genuinely: ‘Can you help me with that? Who’s coming second?’”It has become Turner’s habit to check the weather for polling day, in the hope that a clear sky could encourage people out.But he believes beyond this election that a great challenge for Labour will be to convince people politicians are not “all the same” – a perception that he believes was deepened by the failed promises of Brexit and Boris Johnson.He said: “I think the big problem is if you’re in a low-wage economy, then people have got bigger things to worry about: paying the rents, paying the mortgages, looking after the family, feeding the kids. Going along to the polling station hardly matters.”Turner notes that there was real enthusiasm for voting for leave in the Brexit referendum, with the leave campaign attracting 73.4% of the vote in Hull East. Across the city, turnout was 62.9%.There was also excitement for Johnson in 2019: Turner gave him the moniker “Boris the magnificent” because of the impression on the doorsteps. Turner was close to losing his seat to the Tories.defaultBut that trust turned to dust, he said, after Partygate and the realisation that the most notable impact of Brexit on Hull had been a 50% loss in catching quotas for the city’s biggest deep-sea trawler due to changes in access to Norway’s waters.Turner believes Labour’s cautious approach to its manifesto is the right one. Further empty promises would only deepen the problem, he says. He suggests that part of the solution might be to make it easier for people to vote by allowing them to vote over a number of days, for example.But the rise of Reform, which is expected to come from nowhere and take second pace in Hull East, highlights to him how important it will be for the next Labour government to be truly radical and prove they are different.“People in Hull East should be voting because, actually, it makes a real difference in areas like [this] to their lives,” he said. “To sort of persuade them to get from … that feeling of it doesn’t matter to actually giving them something to vote for is a difficulty.“I’ve said to Keir and anybody else who was prepared to listen: ‘Look, what we need is policy, which really makes a difference in their lives.’”The Sure Start centres of the last Labour government that helped young parents were the sort of initiative that Turner said gave people a stake in the election, but that they had needed more time to bed in.For now, Turner can only hope that the votes are there on 4 July to make change possible – and that Labour’s message on taxing non-doms and the rest is getting through.","‘We’re taxing non-doms, not condoms!’: Labour strives to reconnect with disengaged voters",17,8
365,"Westminster has been rocked by allegations that senior Tories bet on the date of the general election before it was announced by Rishi Sunak.The Gambling Commission, an independent watchdog, has launched an investigation into whether party figures illicitly used insider knowledge.So far five Conservatives have been named as under investigation, as well as one Labour candidate who bet on the result in his own seat.Here The Telegraph walks you through the developing scandal.When did it start?The issue first came to public attention on June 12 when The Guardian reported that Craig Williams had placed a bet on the timing of the election.Mr Williams, who is the Prime Minister’s parliamentary private secretary, admitted having a “flutter” on the fact that the snap poll would be called in July.He reportedly placed a £100 wager on that fact at a bookmaker in his Welsh constituency three days before Mr Sunak announced the election date.The Conservatives have since withdrawn their support for Mr Williams, who will now appear on the ballot paper on July 4 as an independent candidate.Who is involved?It has since emerged that four other Conservatives are being investigated for betting on the election.The Gambling Commission is investigating Tony Lee, the party’s director of campaigning, and Laura Saunders, his wife who was the Tory candidate in Bristol North West.Nick Mason, Craig Williams and Laura Saunders are being investigated - Alice HeppleTony Lee is on 'leave' following the probeLike Mr Williams, the party has since removed its support from Ms Saunders.Nick Mason, its chief data officer, has taken a leave of absence following the Gambling Commission to investigate him.Allegations have also been made against Russell George, a Tory member of the devolved Welsh parliament.Russell George is the fifth Conservative politician to be investigated in connection with betsThree other Conservatives are reported to have bet on the election. But they are not under investigation by the watchdog because they are not accused of using inside information to do so.Alister Jack, the secretary of state for Scotland, has admitted that he placed three bets on the date of the election earlier this year, winning one and losing two.Kevin Hollinrake, the business minister, said on Thursday that he had bet on the Tories winning the election but not on the seat where he is running.Meanwhile, Sir Philip Davies, who is standing for re-election in Shipley, has not denied placing an £8,000 bet that he would lose the seat at the election.Liam Booth-Smith, Rishi Sunak’s chief of staff, has been interviewed as a witness by the Gambling Commission but he is not suspected of placing any bets himself.Is anyone else involved?The Labour Party has also been dragged into the scandal after suspending a candidate who wagered that he would lose his seat.Kevin Craig, who was due to stand for Sir Keir Starmer’s party in Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, said he had planned to give the winnings to local charities.Kevin Craig said he was 'deeply sorry'The Metropolitan Police has also confirmed that the Gambling Commission is looking at five more police officers over election bets after one from Rishi Sunak’s close protection team was arrested.Who is investigating?The Conservatives are conducting an internal investigation into their own candidates.But probes are also being carried out by the Gambling Commission and the Metropolitan Police.Scotland Yard has taken control of a number of criminal investigations into the scandal.The force said on Wednesday that it will take charge of a small number of cases where offences such as misconduct in public office are alleged to have been committed.The Gambling Commission is continuing its own investigations into offences which are alleged to have breached the Gambling Act, under which it is illegal to use inside information to place a bet.Inside information is information which is known by an individual or individuals as a result of their role in connection with an event, and which is not in the public domain.“If someone uses confidential information in order to gain an unfair advantage when betting, this may constitute an offence of cheating under Section 42 of the Gambling Act, which is a criminal offence,” the act says.What is the punishment for using inside information?It is therefore a potential criminal offence to place a bet on something when you already know the outcome thanks to information that is not in the public domain.Those found guilty could face up to two years in prison, a fine, or both.In many cases, the Gambling Commission deems sanctions imposed by a sports governing body or the confiscation of winnings by a betting operator to be proportionate.",Everything you need to know about the betting scandal rocking the general election,17,11
215,"Rishi Sunak is in panic mode with less than a week until polling day. WPA Pool via Getty ImagesA Labour government with a huge majority will rig the electoral system to keep themselves in power for “decades”, Rishi Sunak will claim as he tries to scare voters ahead of polling day on Thursday.The desperate prime minister will even say Keir Starmer - the former Director or Public Prosecutions - will give prisoners the vote to stay in power.He will say there are “four days to save Britain” and repeat discredited claims that Labour would put up taxes by £2,000 per household.Sunak’s bizarre comments, at an election rally on Monday night, come as opinion polls continue to predict a Tory wipeout.Elections guru Professor Sir John Curtice told the BBC on Sunday that the Conservatives could be left with just 100 MPs, compared to Labour’s 450, come Friday morning.In a last-ditch attempt to avoid annihilation at the ballot box, the PM will beg voters not to hand Labour a “supermajority”.That is despite polling evidence that tactic has backfired by making voters more likely to back Starmer’s party.The PM will say: “We have four days to save Britain from a Labour government.“Labour would hike taxes by more than £2,000 for every working family, would shunt our politics to the left and change the rules to ensure that they can stay in power for decades. “If they get the kind of majority, the supermajority that the polls suggest, they will set about entrenching themselves in power.“They will rewrite the rules to make it easier for them to stay in office and harder for anyone to replace them.”He will add: “We already know that they want to give 16-year-olds the vote. They don’t want to do that because they think they are adults, but because they think they will vote for them. What other changes will they make to make it harder to remove them from power?  “Votes for EU nationals? Votes for prisoners? A whole new voting system designed to allow politicians to stitch things up behind closed doors and shut you out? “Don’t let them do that. Don’t take that risk. Don’t surrender to Labour.”The prime minister’s warnings are similar to the unsuccessful scare tactics - dubbed “Project Fear” - used by the Leave campaign during the 2016 Brexit referendum.Related...Rishi Sunak Has Insisted He Is 'Proud' Of The Tories' Disastrous Election CampaignRishi Sunak Left Squirming As He's Confronted With Ordinary People's Lives In Tory BritainHow Even Traditional Tories Are Determined To Boot Rishi Sunak Out Of Downing Street",Desperate Rishi Sunak Goes Full Project Fear As Tories Brace For Election Wipeout,20,3
361,"Voting in the first round of parliamentary elections is under way in mainland France. The last polling stations close at 8pm local time on Sunday.Elections for the 577 seats in France’s national assembly are a two-round process. The shape of the new parliament will become clear only after the second round on 7 July.TurnoutThe turnout at 5pm CET in mainland France was 59.39% according to the interior ministry – a significant increase on the 39.42% who had voted at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2022. Polling has suggested that this parliamentary election may have the highest turnout in almost 30 years. The polling firm Elabe estimated that the final turnout would reach 69.5%.Related: France heading to the polls in high-stakes snap parliamentary electionNational vote shareEstimations at 8pm CET will project the national vote share of parties. But this figure must be taken with caution. It will show the broad dynamic of support for each party across France, but it does not indicate the shape of a future parliament because the 577 different constituency votes will be defined by local context and candidates.Polls have shown that, in terms of overall national vote share, the far-right National Rally could substantially increase its showing from the last parliament election, when it took just over 18%, to about 35%. The left alliance has been predicted to follow on about 27% and Emmanuel Macron’s centrists behind on about 21%.ResultsConstituency results will trickle in throughout Sunday evening. A small number of candidates may be elected in the first round. This will depend on voter turnout. To win a seat in the first round, a candidate must score more than 50% of the votes cast, but they must also reach 25% of the total number of registered voters in that constituency. A high turnout makes it easier to reach that threshold of 25%.The far-right leader Marine Le Pen is hoping to be elected in her northern constituency in the first-round and hopes several of her outgoing MPs will do the same. The left is hoping to see some MPs elected on Sunday night, particularly in Paris and its eastern and northern outskirts.Second-round runoffsMost constituencies will go to a second round runoff on 7 July. The two top candidates will go through to the runoff, as well as any candidate who scores more than 12.5% of the total number of registered voters in that constituency. A high turnout would make that 12.5% threshold easier to reach.There could be a significant number of constituencies facing a runoff between three or more candidates on 7 July. This could result in bartering on the left, traditional right and centre over whether one of the candidates should stand down in order not to split the vote against the far right. The bartering and tactical strategy among some parties will begin on Sunday night.The final list of candidates who will stand in the second round runoff will be known on Tuesday evening.",French parliamentary elections – what to look out for and when,19,8
282,"Six long weeks of election campaigning are coming to an end, with the polls showing hardly any change in Labour’s lead from when the contest was called on May 22. Sir Keir Starmer is still on course to become prime minister on Friday with one of the biggest parliamentary majorities in history.But while his party remains 20 points ahead of the Tories, this gap flatters to deceive. The polls have also shown a steady fall in support for Labour, from around 44 per cent of the vote share to as low as 38 per cent. Labour has maintained its distance from its opponents because Reform UK has been siphoning support from the Conservatives. If some of those voters return to the fold on Thursday, Sir Keir is still likely to win but by less of a margin than predicted.If there were to be a uniform swing from Tory to Labour, then 38 per cent of the vote would not be enough to secure a Labour victory. It would be the largest party but would need deals with others.But the presence of Reform and tactical voting in Tory-held seats could hand dozens of constituencies to Labour and the Lib Dems, much as in 1997 when the Tories were reduced to around 160 MPs. Some in the party now think that would be a good result on Thursday and confound predictions of a total wipeout.Undecided voters need to consider the consequences not only of giving a party with no popular mandate such a large majority, but of wrecking the one party that will provide any opposition. The Lib Dems or Scottish Nationalists (who face their own reckoning) will back most of what Labour is planning. It really will be a one-party state.Some on the Right want to punish the Tories for failing over 14 years to challenge the social democratic consensus. They hope then to see the party rebuild in opposition. Yet by voting Reform, or not at all, they risk seeing all the things they criticise the Tories over – from climate change policies to immigration and tax rises – worsen under Labour.On the BBC yesterday, Rishi Sunak remained combative and hopeful, as indeed he must. He said that he was proud of his campaign, despite the troubles it has faced.It has alerted the electorate to the dangers of Labour and the stark choice the country faces. If voters are not persuaded yet, they will find out soon enough.",The choice in this general election couldn’t be clearer,20,11
76,"In the upper-echelons of the Labour Party, as they consider a UK run by them (and such is their confidence, the urinal-equipped chancellor’s loo is being reassessed ready for the first female occupant of the role), a name is whispered with a worried nod of the head and a concerned furrowing of the brow.The rise and calamitous fall of Emmanuel Macron has become the scary bedtime story for Sir Keir Starmer’s closest team – the type of tale a concerned parent might tell their children to stop them scrumping apples. “Don’t do that, or you will suffer the same fate as Monsieur Le President!”A centrist, pro-European leader, Macron won the 2017 French presidential election on a wave of “change” rhetoric. For a period, he could do no wrong, as hyper-low interest rates and strong growth cemented the idea that En Marche! (the new party he founded) was going to solve the age-old problems of establishment, out-of-touch politics and, even worse, corrupt, idiot politicians. He was welcomed as a breath of fresh air, an antidote to the chaos of busted governments that had run out of ideas.Then came Covid, the Ukraine-related energy shock, and controversial attempts at public sector and policy reform, particularly to the pension age. Being pro-EU (with the sticky insistence on remote rule-making from Brussels) suddenly became a hindrance, not a help. After rising so high, Macron has fallen to the humbling low of having to call an early election on the core question of what kind of France voters want. When Edward Heath tried a similar “Who governs?” strategy in 1974, it did not end well for the Conservatives.Macron has been assaulted from the Right and the Left for failing to seal the deal he put before the French electorate. He is the Sun King turned to Mr Bean, to paraphrase Sir Vince Cable’s deadly description of that other fallen giant, Gordon Brown.But whereas Brown came up against a rather gentlemanly One Nation Tory in the form of Lord Cameron, Macron’s challenge is dressed very differently. Tweeds have been replaced by stilettos. The man “who was the future once” has been humiliated not only by a coalition of the Left but also at the hands of a hard-Right, charismatic leader who sniffed an opportunity (immigration) and turned it into a political attack super-virus. Marine Le Pen is not just a threat to Le President. She is a threat to the established order.Just as Nigel Farage would like to be here. Both gladly dabble with the dark forces of “culture” and “patriotism” to gather support.What does France and more specifically Macron have to do with Sir Keir Starmer? Lots, as it happens. Macron won two thirds of the votes in 2017, 30 per cent more than Le Pen’s Front National. It was a clear victory which appeared to prove that France wanted him, and not the alternative. But rather than deal with the alternative, Macron has now been surrounded by it. An economy in a funk, immigration continuing to worry enough voters to matter, and a leader who confused winning big with political righteousness.And that has become Labour’s bedtime story. On Thursday, Starmer is set to land what appears to be a game-changing majority. But he will do so without convincing the voters that Labour is actually the answer. For a period, benign economic tailwinds (next week energy prices will fall by 7 per cent, by the end of the year 1.5 million homeowners are likely to see their mortgage repayments drop, real incomes will continue to rise) will hide a myriad of rocks under the surface.Will Labour’s policy of return agreements really stop the boats? Will Wes Streeting, all set to be the next health secretary, put in place the right policies to start turning around the NHS and social care? Will the unions wear it? Will voters remain silent in the face of the pro-building revolution Labour has promised?And if growth stutters, the public finances will turn against Rachel Reeves and the bond markets will start charging the UK more to fund the increased borrowing that will be necessary to hide the holes. Taxes will rise and Starmer’s support – wide but always shallow – may disappear.And Farage, the new MP for Clacton, will be waiting.Labour is a tribe that tends towards panic. You don’t lose as many elections as the party has managed in its 124-year history without sensing disaster around every corner – because it so often is. Where the Right are mostly furious when voters turn against them and shout that it is everyone else’s fault, the Left disappear into months, sometimes years, of introspection and “why are we so useless?” narratives.In government, the same emotions prevail. It can lead to caution, paralysis and poor policy-making. Particularly if you have, like Starmer and Brown, a rather dogmatic tendency to believe that pulling the levers of the state can solve problems. Starmer, unlike Brown, also sees the EU as a route to greater prosperity, a policy push laughingly dismissed by one seasoned EU negotiator I know as “delusional, they are never going to give us anything of any real economic value, we’ve left”.And Farage will sniff his opportunity.“On July 5, we are going to have to think immediately about Reform,” one senior Labour figure told me. “If we leave it, think the threat will go away, then we will only have to look across the Channel for what could happen.”Starmer makes a lot of the fact that he only recently came into politics. But what he thinks is a strength is actually a weakness. Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair were political to their fingertips, able to marshal arguments that convinced electorates for nearly all of their political careers.Blair, whom Starmer admires, had the political instincts to rise above controversies, even when, as in the case of his enthusiasm for open borders with the EU and the Iraq war, he created them. People often forget that he won his third election in a row after the controversy over non-existent weapons of mass destruction.Starmer lacks the political nous to see traps before they form. He does not suffer hubris, at least. And in Reeves he will have an able chancellor who is likely to help him out of a number of bear pits. Streeting is another strong performer who wants to reform the health service and not just give it more money.Starmer will need to discover a new gear once in No 10 – market orientated, non-ideological, willing to listen. Drift to his instinctive Left and he will allow space for Farage to pounce, particularly if whatever is left of a bloodied and bowed Conservative Party tries to do a deal with the private-school educated banker from leafy, suburban London who likes to pretend he is in some way a “man of the people”.If Starmer does not learn that being prime minister is different from leading (and liking) a cosy club of liberal progressives, then the seeds of his destruction will soon become apparent. Just as they have for the President of the Fifth Republic.",Marine Le Pen’s surge is a warning to Sir Keir Starmer,20,11
304,"The First Minister says he would discuss a new immigration scheme for Scotland proposed by Labour.Speaking in Irvine on Sunday as part of the SNP’s campaign ahead of the upcoming election, John Swinney said at a UK-level, the Labour Party’s current approach towards immigration is “fiercely hostile”, and called for “urgent clarity” from the party to set out its immigration plans for Scotland.In its manifesto, the Labour Party says it will ensure that “migration to address skills shortages triggers a plan to upskill workers and improve working conditions in the UK”.It added: “Given skills policy and employment support are devolved, we will work with the Scottish government when designing workforce plans for different sectors.“This will ensure our migration and skills policies work for every part of the UK. We will end the long-term reliance on overseas workers in some parts of the economy.“The days of a sector languishing endlessly on the shortage occupation lists with no action to train up workers will come to an end.”Mr Swinney said: “There are some newspaper reports that the Labour Party is proposing some sort of immigration scheme for Scotland.“I would welcome such discussions – I think we need urgent clarity from the Labour Party if that actually is their position because at a UK level, the UK leadership of the Labour Party is fiercely hostile to immigration and are following the agenda of the Conservatives.“So I want to make sure that we’ve got substantial opportunities for discussion and my government will certainly engage in a constructive way on these questions.”Earlier on Sunday, Mr Swinney told BBC’s The Sunday Show he would work with Labour if it wins, and encourage more people of working age to move to Scotland for their career prospects.Asked to elaborate, Mr Swinney said: “The key thing we’ve lost is access to freedom of movement in the European Union.“That has been a disaster for Scotland – it’s one of the many attributes of Brexit that has been damaging to the Scottish economy and that issue is really not being covered in the election campaign.“The Labour Party and the Conservatives are running a mile from the economic and social impacts of Brexit.“It’s been damaging in terms of population loss, it’s been damaging in terms of economic opportunities, so the sooner we can get back into the EU, which we can through independence, we should take that opportunity.”Asked if he is happy with the response he and his party received while in Irvine, Mr Swinney said: “There’s a strong reaction, a positive reaction to our campaign.“People realise that austerity, which was started by the Conservatives, delivered for 14 years, is now going to be carried along by the Labour Party and that’s absolutely crystal clear from all the evidence that’s been set out.“So we’ve got to have a strong group of SNP MPs that will reel against austerity in the House of Commons and do all that they can to protect the Scottish interest and to make sure that we have the opportunity to design a future for Scotland, in Scotland, which will ensure that the priorities and the needs of the people of Scotland are effectively addressed”.",Swinney says he would discuss Labour’s proposed immigration scheme for Scotland,19,4

For them, it's all a game,"" he told Beth Rigby.""They're awful, they are ghastly,"" he added.Mr Farage's language goes further than an interview two weeks ago when he was also asked about joining the Tories.He is making his eighth bid to become an MP, this time in Clacton in Essex, and while some polls project him to win, the UK's first past-the-post voting system makes it difficult for Reform to make huge strides in a couple of elections.Earlier this month Sky News' deputy political editor Sam Coates asked him if the Tory party would be a better vehicle for his ambitions post-election and if he would rule out joining.Mr Farage said he could not see it happening and called the question ""moronic"".Pressed if that was a categorical rejection, he said he had ""no intention"" of joining the Tories but did not rule it out.Read More: Farage sidesteps question about Tory switchSome Tories want Mr Farage to join the fold to combat the threat of Reform UK, which is to the right of the Conservative Party.Reform's popularity in the polls surged after Mr Farage announced he would be taking over as leader and putting himself forward as a candidate in the election.Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman and former immigration minister Robert Jenrick are in favour of him joining but the issue is divisive - with senior figures like Priti Patel, Kemi Badenoch and James Cleverly being against it.After enjoying a relatively smooth start to his election campaign, Mr Farage has this week been embroiled in a race row after one of his campaigners was caught on camera using a racial slur to describe the prime minister - and one candidate has now defected to the Tories.

131,"More than £320m spent by the government on the controversial scheme to send asylum seekers to Rwanda is likely to be lost if the Conservatives are voted out of power at Thursday’s general election.The sum has been spent on economic development money for Rwanda, along with set-up costs for the scheme, which cannot be recovered if it does not go ahead.Labour has described the scheme as a gimmick that will go down in history as “one of the most absurd and wasteful Home Office policies of all time”.The party has committed to ditching the scheme if elected, instead focusing resources on a new Border Security Command to smash the people-smuggling gangs helping asylum seekers to cross the Channel in small boats.Related: Home secretary’s aide says Rwanda policy is ‘crap’, in leaked recordingThe Home Office has said that if the Conservatives are re-elected the first flight may take off for Rwanda on 24 July.A National Audit Office report published in February of this year found that £270m would be handed over to Rwanda by the end of the 2023/24 financial year in April for the country’s Economic Transformation and Integration Fund (ETIF). It is non-refundable.Other monies spent that cannot be refunded include £2.3m on legal fees for the Home Office to respond to legal challenges against Rwanda, Home Office direct staffing costs for the scheme, which stood at £2m in February 2024, £413,541 on three home secretaries travelling to Rwanda at various points since the deal was announced in April 2022 and an estimated £500,000 in the cost of arresting and detaining more than 100 asylum seekers who were intended to be sent to Rwanda.All of those asylum seekers are now thought to have been released back into the community and some of them are seeking damages for unlawful detention. There is also the cost of bail hearings for this group.In addition, there are miscellaneous costs such as training Rwandan officials and resettling vulnerable refugees from Rwanda here.The Home Office has always acknowledged that the Rwanda deal is a “high risk and novel policy” and agreed to monitor the ETIF funding because, according to the NAO report: “The Home Office has recognised the need to manage the risk of fraud, bribery and corruption.” It is unclear what will happen to this monitoring of the non-refundable hundreds of millions if the Conservatives do not win the election.Stephen Kinnock, Labour’s shadow minister for Immigration, said: “Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda gimmick will go down in history as one of the most absurd and wasteful Home Office policies of all time. It is an insult to the British taxpayer, and the tiny numbers of people involved will not create a deterrent for those crossing the Channel. “Labour will cancel the Rwanda gimmick and redirect the money into a new Border Security Command, with hundreds of new specialist officers using new powers to smash the criminal gangs that are smuggling people across the Channel.”Sonya Sceats, chief executive at Freedom from Torture, said: “The sums of money spent on this disastrous “cash for humans” scheme are eye watering but wholly beside the point when we remember the people at the centre of this scandal.“Every day in our therapy rooms we care for men and women who have suffered torture only to face existential dread here in the UK at the prospect of being bundled on to planes to Rwanda, a notorious torturing state.”The Conservatives have been approached for comment.",More than £320m spent on Rwanda policy will be lost if Tories lose election,20,8

Asked whether he thought he would still be prime minister on Friday, he said: “Yes. I’m fighting very hard and I think people are waking up to the real danger of what a Labour government means.”Rishi Sunak, soaked in rain, pauses as he delivers a speech to announce the election date (Getty)But as the Tory blame game escalated before even a vote has been counted former cabinet minister John Redwood accused Mr Sunak of helping to deliver a large Labour majority.He hit out at what he called the ‘One Nation leadership’ of his party and said together with Nigel Farage’s Reform, they will “visit on us a Labour government that may have a lower vote share than Labour led by Jeremy Corbyn gained in 2017 but have a large majority of MPs”.In a small crumb of good news for Mr Sunak, however, the Reform candidate in Erewash, Liam Booth-Isherwood defected to back the Conservatives. “Whilst I have campaigned alongside many decent, honest and hardworking people during the course of the General Election campaign in Erewash, the reports of widespread racism and sexism in Reform have made clear that there is a significant moral issue within certain elements of the party,” he said.In a wide-ranging interview, the Leave-campaigning Tory leader also admitted that Brexit has been bad for many British businesses.He was confronted by comments by his small business minister Kevin Hollinrake that there was “no doubt” exporting to the EU had been made more difficult by the UK’s exit.Mr Hollinrake said: “There’s no doubt, for some businesses, it is more difficult to trade with the European Union. There is no doubt that is the case.”He went on to pick out businesses in the food and drink sector, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises.Kevin Hollinrake admits Brexit was bad for many businesses (Good Morning Britain)Asked about those remarks, the prime minister said: “Of course when you leave the single market and the customs union that is going to change our trading relationships.”He added: “But we have the deepest, bilateral free trade agreement with the European continent that any nation has anywhere around the world.”He also claimed the UK is a “better place to live” in now than it was when the Tories took office in 2010, although he pointed to the pandemic and the war in Ukraine as he conceded “the last few years have been difficult for everyone”.But he was then asked to look at a screen on which viewers’ comments were projected. One of them, Sheila, told the PM: “Our biggest worry is not about tax, it’s about having the basics.”An at times tetchy PM also became involved in a spat with the BBC presenter, who at one point told him: “That’s not what I said prime minister.”He also claimed there was a “clear difference” between his handling of the racism row surrounding Tory donor Frank Hester and how Nigel Farage responded to racist comments made about the PM by a Reform UK canvasser.On the programme, he was shown a message from a viewer who expressed concern that Mr Sunak’s stance on racism had not been zero tolerance and who pointed to the Hester row.The donor, from whom the party has continued to accept donations, allegedly said Labour MP Diane Abbott “should be shot” and that she made him “want to hate all black women”.Mr Sunak said: “I think it’s reasonable when someone is genuinely contrite about what’s happened, accepts what they’ve done is wrong, then that apology is accepted.”He added: “The difference here is... Nigel Farage has just described these comments as ‘inappropriate’.“They’re not inappropriate. They were vile and racist and wrong, but he’s only said that they’re inappropriate.“The person who made them has only apologised to the Reform party for the impact it’s had on them. It’s a very clear difference. There’s no contrition or remorse or acceptance of what’s happened in that case.”For his part Mr Farage insisted “the bad apples are gone” from Reform.After claiming the audience on BBC's Question Time on Friday, during which he was questioned about his party's supporters, ""was rigged"", which the BBC denies, he said Reform would campaign to abolish the TV licence fee as ""the leading voice of opposition"" because it had ""abused its position of power”.Earlier, Mr Sunak claimed Sir Keir Starmer could inflict “irreversible damage” on the UK within 100 days of entering Downing Street.The PM said Labour “cannot be trusted” and predicted a plan to impose VAT on private schools would cause “chaos” for families.Meanwhile, Labour said Sir Keir‘s first steps would be restoring economic stability and cutting NHS waiting lists as “the work of change begins”. The Labour Party leader said his party offered voters hope for a better future.After the PM’s interview, Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s shadow paymaster general, said: “It’s excruciating to watch Rishi Sunak just gloss over the concerns of ordinary working people.“Rishi Sunak has no remorse for his record: prices are up in the shops, NHS waiting lists have rocketed, and mortgages have soared. He just doesn’t understand what the Conservatives have inflicted on voters over the past 14 years.“Britain simply cannot afford five more years of the Tories. Their pie-in-the-sky, unfunded manifesto risks heaping £4,800 more onto family mortgages.”",Rishi Sunak says he is proud of disastrous election campaign - and claims he will win,20,9
17,"A former Tory cabinet minister has accused Rishi Sunak of helping to ensure a large Labour victory as the Tory blame game escalates before even a single vote has been cast.John Redwood hit out at what he called the ‘One Nation leadership’ of his party.He said that together with Nigel Farage’s Reform, if they polls are correct, they will “visit on us” a Labour government “that may have a lower vote share than Labour led by Jeremy Corbyn... but have a large majority of MPs giving it a lot of potential power.”However, that would only hold if Labour “can keep its party together”, he added.Sir John Redwood (Getty Images)A shock poll last week put Mr Farage’s Reform three points ahead of the Conservatives.Although unlikely to take more than a handful of seats, Tory MPs fear they will split the right wing vote, handing many constituencies to Labour.Opinion polls also suggest Keir Starmer’s party is on course to a handsome victory on Thursday, with some forecasting the party could even have a larger parliamentary majority than Tony Blair in 1997.Some Brexiteers are furious that what they see as a “gulf” on the right of the party that has left Mr Farage and Reform to potentially take millions of voters from the Tories.Right-wingers like Suella Braverman and Jacob Rees-Mogg have already said they agree with many of Reform’s policies.As polling day nears many Conservatives are gearing up to set out what they think went wrong.Nadine Dorries has claimed the election ‘will be a verdict on Michael Gove’ and think tanks (Jeff Overs/BBC/PA) (PA Media)Last week former cabinet minister Nadine Dorries  was first out of the traps, telling The Independent she blames Michael Gove for a malaise that has set in over the last 14 years.“This general election will be a verdict on Michael Gove and his think tanks, Onward and Policy Exchange, more than a verdict on any serving or former prime minister,” she said.She added: “Gove has repeatedly stabbed democratically elected Prime Ministers in the back - Boris in 2016 and 22, and Liz in 22 - and at every turn he’s chosen the socialist rather than the conservative option. This is why we’re behind in the polls.On his blog, Mr Redwood wrote: “Labour is forecast to have a huge majority of MPs. Why?“There is a frustration that the two parties (Labour and Conservative) are so alike. They both backed Covid lockdowns. They both backed printing large sums of money which proved inflationary...They have both presided over large increases in NHS waiting lists, Labour in Wales and Conservatives in England. They both backed the Windsor framework limiting the opportunities of Brexit. Neither proposed a good pruning of EU bureaucracy and regulations. Both allowed large scale migration.”He added: “The result of the combined actions of Reform and the One Nation Conservative leadership if the polls are right will be to visit on us a Labour government that may have a lower vote share than Labour led by Jeremy Corbyn gained in 2017  but have a large majority of MPs giving it a lot of potential power if it can keep its party together.”",John Redwood accuses Rishi Sunak of helping to deliver large Labour majority as Tory blame game escalates,20,9
313,"The National Rally (RN) has won 34% of the popular vote in the first round of France’s snap two-round general election, according to early estimates, with the leftwing New Popular Front (NFP) alliance on 28%-29% and President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist Together bloc on 20%-22%.A national vote share, however, is extremely difficult to translate into a projected number of seats in the assemblée nationale. That’s because the final outcome will depend on the results in the constituencies. While pollsters issue seat estimates, France’s polling watchdog does not endorse them.Here’s a guide to what comes next as voters gear up for the decisive second round of voting on 7 July, when France could decide to give control of its government to the far-right, anti-immigrant party for the first time in its history.What are the rules of the two-round system?To win one of the 577 seats in the national assembly in the first round, a candidate must get more than 50% of ballots cast, representing at least 25% of registered voters.This usually happens only rarely, although the 2024 election’s high turnout has seen the number rise sharply to perhaps as many as 80.If no candidate in a constituency achieves that, the two highest scorers plus anyone else who collected at least 12.5% of total registered voters advance to a second round. In that round, the candidate who obtains the most votes is elected.How does it usually work?The two-round system is highly disproportionate and artificially boosts larger parties. On a turnout of 65%, for example, the 12.5% hurdle means parties would have to secure the backing of almost 20% of eligible voters to advance to the second round.In recent legislative elections, turnout has been significantly lower than that, meaning that in almost every constituency, only two candidates have gone through to the second round and the number of three- or four-way contests has been very low.In the 2012 elections, with a turnout of 57%, there were 34 so-called “triangular” runoffs. In 2017, when turnout was 49%, there was only one, and last time around in 2022 there were eight on a turnout of just 47%. The previous record was 76, in 1997.What’s different about this election?The combination of the highest turnout since the 1980s and fewer candidates – 4,011 against 6,290 in 2022 – from just three main camps (left, centre and far right) – means the second round of the 2024 ballot will feature a record number of “triangular” contests.With an estimated 69% of registered voters casting a ballot on Sunday, voters in a record number of constituencies could, in principle, face a three-way race on 7 July, according to polling – perhaps as many as half of all seats in the assembly. The pollster Ipsos on Sunday forecast between 285 and 315 three-way contests.In theory, three- or four-way contests should work in favour of the party with the largest share of the vote in the first round – in these elections, generally RN – because the opposition vote is split. Many three-way contests, however, do not stay that way.What generally happens in “triangular” contests?Until recently, if the RN looked like winning a seat in a three-way race, the second- and third-placed parties would negotiate to determine whose candidate would drop out.To be successful, however, that strategy requires both that the mainstream parties are willing to withdraw candidates, and that voters are happy to play along, with centre-left voters backing a candidate from the centre right, and vice versa.But that “Republican front” has been steadily fraying, with voters increasingly unwilling to “hold their noses” and cast their ballots for parties whose policies do not necessarily align with their political preferences. In 2022, RN returned a record 89 deputies.So what will happen this time?As far as the parties go, senior figures in the four-party left-green NFP alliance – including the firebrand leader of the radical left France Unbowed (LFI), Jean-Luc Mélenchon – have promised that in all constituencies where RN is in first place and an NFP candidate is in third, the NFP candidate will withdraw.Macron’s camp has been far less clear about what its candidates would do in a similar position, with the president and party leaders calling both rival camps “extreme” – in the case of NFP, largely because it is dominated by LFI. On Sunday, however, the prime minister, Gabriel Attal, said third placed candidates should step aside: “Not one single vote must go to the National Rally.”As far as voters go, things are even more complicated. An Ipsos poll last week found 87% NFP voters willing to cast their ballot to block RN, but only 62% of Together voters. Another poll, by Odoxa, found that fewer voters (41%) were willing to block RN than to block NFP (47%) or Together (44%).In short, the situation is highly uncertain and will remain fluid until the actual candidates running in the second round become clear. With up to half the seats in the assembly potentially becoming three-way contests, the scope for an anti-RN “Republican front” is clearly there – but the extent of inter-party cooperation will be critical, as will be voters’ willingness to vote tactically.",French elections: far right on course for first round victory. What happens now?,20,8
343,"The son of a toolmaker and the first of his family to go to university, Sir Keir Starmer is the most working class Labour Party leader in a generation.Yet when focus groups are asked what they think his favourite drink is, they guess that he’s partial to a gin and tonic rather than a pint down the local boozer. Many also assume his title is hereditary.So what do you really need to know about the man who, on current poll ratings, is set to be the UK’s next prime minister?His early lifeStarmer was born in Southwark, south London, in 1962, as the second of four children. His parents were Labour Party members and named him after Keir Hardie, the party’s first leader in parliament.The family moved out of the capital and he grew up in Hurst Green, a village just outside the small Surrey town of Oxted. He was active in youth politics from his teenage years but was also a skilled musician, taking music lessons alongside Norman Cook, who later became better known as a member of The Housemartins and the DJ Fatboy Slim.Starmer played the flute, piano, violin and recorder and was a junior exhibitioner at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.His familyStarmer is married to Victoria, a former solicitor who later retrained in occupational health and now works for the NHS. The pair met through their work in the law in the early 2000s and married in Essex in 2007.She was first seen accompanying her husband when the couple were filmed clapping for carers during the pandemic in 2020 outside their home in Camden. They have two children, a son and daughter, but both are kept out of the public eye.Victoria's father was Jewish and originally came from Poland, while her mother converted when they got married. Starmer has said in a previous interview that ""my wife in particular wants our children to know the faith of her family"" and that they ""observe some of the practices, for example Friday night prayers"".Keir Starmer with parents, Rodney and Josephine, at his graduation. (Twitter/Keir Starmer)His parentsThe Labour leader's father, Rodney Starmer, worked as a toolmaker in a factory, and his mother Josephine Starmer (née Baker), was a nurse.His father worked long, 14-hour days but spent his time outside work caring for Josephine, who was diagnosed with the autoimmune condition Still’s disease. She required two hip and knee replacements twice in her lifetime and struggled with arthritic pain.As a young man Starmer also helped care for his mother, which he has said led to him being more emotionally reserved. His sister, Katy, recalled: “He’s had to be a grown-up all his life. I’ve always been quite open about my feelings – Keir is good at most things, but not that.” Josephine Starmer died in 2015, and his father three years later.His educationStarmer passed the 11-plus examination, and attended Reigate Grammar School from age 11. While he was at the school it became an independent fee-paying institution, but as an existing student he was exempt from fees, and his tuition in the sixth form was covered by a bursary.After school he studied law at the University of Leeds, this first in his family to attend university, graduating with a first class degree in 1985. He undertook postgraduate law studied at the University of Oxford, where he served as editor of a radical magazine, Socialist Alternatives.A photograph of a younger Starmer as shown on ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories in 2021. (ITV)Why is he a sir?Stamer was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 2014 in recognition of his work in the legal profession, culminating in a five-year term as director of public prosecutions (DPP).He first became a barrister in 1987 at the Middle Temple, later joining Doughty Street Chambers and was appointed a Queen’s counsel in 2002, aged just 39. In 2008 he was appointed head of the Crown Prosecution Service and DPP.During his tenure he chose to prosecute three Labour MPs and a Conservative in the wake of the parliamentary expenses scandal, and was responsible for prosecuting former MP Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce for perverting the course of justice after Pryce claimed responsibility for her former husband’s speeding offence.Starmer on... the NHSThe Labour leader has said that, if elected, his government would “get the NHS working around the clock and pay staff properly to do it”.The remark followed a commitment to provide £1.1bn in funding for the health service to cut waiting lists by paying doctors and nurses to carry out additional out-of-hours care, which would be funded by axing tax breaks for wealthy “non-doms” who hoard money overseas. He added: “The Conservative Party that brought our NHS to its knees will put it in the ground. We have to get it back on its feet.”Starmer describes the NHS as “the crowdfunded solution for all of us”, reinforcing his commitment to healthcare being free at the point of use, but says reform is inevitable or the health service would “remain on life support”. He has pledged to integrate up-to-date technology into every part of the NHS including using artificial intelligence to diagnose disease earlier and more accurately.He supported the doctors strikes, telling ministers: “Don’t break junior doctors, talk to them. Get in the room [and] sort it out.”Starmer with his wife, Lady Victoria Starmer, at the Labour Party Conference in October 2023. (Alamy)Starmer on… immigrationThe government has “lost control of borders”, according to Labour. Starmer has said a Labour government would set up a new policy unit to tackle illegal migration and has suggested that a returns agreement for asylum seekers could be negotiated with the European Union to solve the small boats crisis.He described the government’s thwarted Rwanda plan, which would see illegal migrants deported to the African nation but has to be put into practice due to legal blocks, as a “gimmick” and a “farce” and has promised to reverse it.Starmer on... the cost of living crisisStarmer has sought to keep Rishi Sunak’s handling of the cost of living crisis in the minds of voters by claiming that “his fingerprints are all over their struggling household budgets”. In a letter to his shadow cabinet, leaked to The Guardian, he wrote: “Rishi Sunak is the chief architect of choices prioritising the wealthiest and of the government’s failure to get a grip of the economy and get growth going.”He has said he would prioritise tackling inflation, blaming it for putting up prices and eroding household savings, but has pledged to “take the difficult and responsible decisions” to bring it down.Keir Starmer pictured in 2010, when he was director of public prosecutions, making a statement about MPs who face charges over their expenses claims. (Getty)Starmer on... private schoolsLabour has dropped its early promise to scrap charitable status for private schools, but has committed to levying a 20% VAT rate on school fees removing their “unfair tax break”. The money raised, he said, will be used to address the “appalling state” of the school system for all children.“It’s not an attack on private schools. It’s just saying an exemption you have had is going to go,” he warned private schools who have been critical of the plan – reminding them they are not obliged to pass that tax on to parents in the form of increased fees.Starmer on… the House of LordsWhen he was first Labour leader, Starmer proposed a “root and branch reform of the centre of government… rooting out unearned privilege and addressing unaccountable power”.But his promise to scrap the House of Lords within the first four years of a new parliament – a controversial move that caused a split among his party’s grandees, has been abandoned.Starmer still backs plans for a second chamber “electoral legitimacy”, but as his party nears government he has stepped away from the most radical form of that pledge. He is now reportedly committed to cutting the number of hereditary peers, reducing the size of the chamber and introducing a new appointments process.","Who is Keir Starmer?

49,"Ed Davey has been involved in a number of comedy stunts since the election was called. (Alamy)With the spotlight on prime minister Rishi Sunak and Labour leader Keir Starmer as they prepare to slug it out in a general election campaign, the focus had started slipping from Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey until a series of stunts put him back in the spotlight.The former coalition government cabinet minister – who lost his seat, punished by voters for getting into bed with the Tories, but then won it back again – is sending a clear message that he should not be overlooked.He’s had a long political career and the climax may still be ahead: if polls continue to shift away from the Conservatives at the current trajectory, there’s a slim possibility that, if the election is held in October, he could end up as leader of the opposition.So what do we know about the man behind the third party in British politics? Hannah Fearn finds out.His early lifeEd Davey was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on Christmas Day in 1965. He was the youngest of three boys, but lost his father at just four years old and then his mother when he was in his mid-teens. She had spent three years battling cancer, during which time he nursed his mother together with his grandmother and brother Henry.Once a keen Scout and Air Scout, he later remembers feeling “isolated” at school because of his caring responsibilities, which meant he couldn’t take part in after-school activities or sports. “The last 18 months she was bedridden and in a lot of pain. I’d spend hours on the bed, talking to her,” he said. Davey was with his mother when she died at Nottingham General Hospital, after being placed on an unsuited dementia ward.After both his parents had died, Davey was brought up by his maternal grandparents in the village of Eakring, though his grandfather died soon after. He spent much of his childhood and young adulthood close to his grandmother. “First of all, she was looking after me. Then we were looking after each other,” he said.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

He became head boy, with Labour MP Ed Balls – who was studying in the year below – watching on.After school, he achieved a first class degree in philosophy, politics and economics at Jesus College, Oxford where he was junior common room president. After becoming an economics researcher for the Liberal Democrats he returned to study, reading for a master’s degree in economics at Birkbeck College, London.Ed Davey, pictured with his family. (Liberal Democrats)Why is he a Sir?For three years, the Lib Dem leader was a member of the cabinet in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition government, holding the post of secretary of state for energy and climate change from 2012 to 2015. He was knighted in the 2016 New Year’s Honours for “political and public services”.Davey on... the cost of living crisisDavey has repeatedly attacked the government for failing to curb rapid inflation and the devastating effect it is having on household budgets. He called the Conservative Party “so out of touch they might as well be living on another planet”, and said he warned Jeremy Hunt “people are desperate for real help… but all the chancellor could offer is empty words and unfair tax hikes”.In particular, he has urged more action on food price inflation, which analysis from his own party found had risen 37% in one year for the average weekly supermarket trip. He has promised to end energy hikes and abandoned his plan to add 1p to income tax to save the NHS because ordinary voters can no longer afford it.Davey on... the NHSThe Liberal Democrats have made the NHS a cornerstone of their policy platform for the last five years. In Davey’s words: “Voting Conservative is bad for your health.” He promises to reverse cuts to GP numbers and guarantee a doctor’s appointment when you need one, improve access to NHS dentistry and save lives by tackling ambulance call out delays.Davey blames the care crisis for deepening the problems of the health service and says his party would spend £5bn a year on a “care package” to ensure patients are discharged from hospital more quickly, freeing up bed space. However, there is little detail on how this would be financed without raising taxes on the wealthiest - which Davey has promised not to do in his push to poach disillusioned Tory voters.Sir Ed Davey was a member of the Tory-Lib Dem government. (Reuters)Davey on... immigrationThe Lib Dem leader has been a long-standing advocate for refugee rights and critic of the government’s immigration policy. Davey has called for Conservative plans to deport failed asylum seekers to Rwanda a “cynical distraction” from the Partygate crisis and the money would be better spent on measures to tackle the cost of living crisis. He added: “They’ve provided no evidence to suggest that this new policy will stop illegal smuggling, they’re not cracking down on the organised crime gangs, which is what you need to do.”Davey has called for a new right to work for refugees and asylum seekers, and major reform of the Home Office, which he says is no longer up to the job. After the end of the coalition government in 2015, Davey has said his party “was wrong” to go along with the introduction of a minimum income standard for immigrants. He later described the policy as “nasty and unfair”.Davey on... the Post Office scandalDespite the Post Office scandal that led to the wrongful prosecution of more than 700 subpostmasters crossing the tenure of more than a dozen business secretaries, Davey has recently taken the heat for failing to investigate the issue while he was in the job.It has emerged that while a minister, Davey initially rejected a request to meet justice campaigner Alan Bates, and later accepted it only on the advice that it would be good for his PR. He has recently apologised for not acting earlier, admitting that he is sorry that he “did not see through Post Office lies” about the fault in the Horizon programme.",Who is Ed Davey?

125,"Marine Le Pen’s far-right, anti-immigration party is in reach of becoming the biggest political force in the French parliament after a historically high showing in the first round of snap parliament elections.The left and centrists immediately began to call for tactical voting to try to stop the far-right before next Sunday’s final round runoff, after exit polls indicated the National Rally (RN) had won about 34% of the national vote share with the leftwing alliance in second place and Emmanuel Macron’s grouping trailing in a distant third.The RN took about 12m votes – almost three times the 4.2m it took in the last parliamentary election in 2022.Related: Unease and fear in France as Le Pen’s National Rally leads in exit pollsSpeaking after the polls had closed, Le Pen said French people had shown “in an unambiguous vote … their wish to turn the page on seven years of the disdainful and corrosive [presidency]” of Macron. The president’s centrists, she said, had been almost “wiped out” by the RN, which was now hoping to increase its 88 seats in parliament to a majority of 289.This is still seen as a steep challenge, but if it happens in next Sunday’s decisive second round of voting, it will be the first time in French history that a far-right party has won a parliamentary election and forms a government. In that scenario, Macron – who called the election three weeks ago after losing to the RN in the European elections – would have to share power.Equally, the RN could win the largest number of seats but fall short of a majority. Macron could then find himself with a hung parliament unable to govern the EU’s second biggest economy and its top military power.The New Popular Front (NFP), a leftwing coalition formed in an attempt to hold back the far right, was thought to have taken about 29% of the vote share.“We have one week to stop the far right coming to power, all progressives and humanists … have to mobilise behind the New Popular Front,” said Clémentine Autain of the leftwing France Unbowed party before the second-round election race next week.Macron’s centrist alliance fared badly, with exit polls showing it having won between 20.5% and 23% of the vote. It was the biggest grouping in parliament, but it could now could lose more than half of its seats and be relegated to third place.The national vote share indicates the broad trend of voting, but does not predict the exact makeup of the 577-seat parliament, which will only become clear in the final round on 7 July. Most constituencies will now go to runoffs.On Sunday night, Jordan Bardella, Le Pen’s protege and party president, said he wanted to be the “prime minister of all the French”. But in cities such as Paris, Lyon, Lille, Nantes and Strasbourg thousands took part in street demonstrations against his party. Large crowds gathered at the Place de la République in the capital, where leading figures in the left alliance spoke out against the far right.The RN’s chances of winning power will depend on the political dealmaking made by its rivals over the coming days. In the past, the traditional right and leftwing parties have struck agreements to stand down candidates from the runoffs to avoid splitting the vote against the RN. But the tactical voting strategy known as the “republican front” to block the RN is less certain than ever.In a written statement, Macron called on voters to rally behind candidates who are “clearly republican and democratic”, which, based on his recent declarations, would exclude candidates from the RN and from Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s France Unbowed, but not candidates representing the NFP’s more moderate leftwing parties.In an address, the prime minister, Gabriel Attal, echoed that appeal, saying that with the RN at the gates of power, runoff candidates in third place should withdraw. “Not one single vote must go to the National Rally … The stakes are clear: to prevent the National Rally from having an absolute majority,” he said.Mélenchon said the left alliance would withdraw all its candidates who came third in the first round, saying: “Our guideline is simple and clear: not a single more vote for the National Rally.”Several RN MPs were elected in the first round, including Marine Le Pen. In northern France, one of the most popular figures on the French left – the head of the Communist party, Fabien Roussel – was knocked out in the first round by the RN candidate, Guillaume Florquin.The turnout of more than 69% was the highest in almost 40 years in an increasingly polarised country, where Macron had said that a win by either the far right or hard left could lead to “civil war” in France.For decades, the Front National party co-founded by Le Pen’s father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, was regarded as a danger to democracy that promoted racist, antisemitic and anti-Muslim views. Centrist and leftwing politicians attempted to remind voters of the history of the 52-year-old party, which at its start included in its ranks former members of a Waffen-SS military unit under Nazi command during the second world war. But the renamed party surged after Marine Le Pen’s years-long public relations drive to normalise its policies and detoxify its image.The anti-immigration party has, however, kept its traditional doctrine once known as “France for the French”, or “national preference”, which it has renamed “national priority”. It means that French citizens would, if the RN were in power, be given priority over non-nationals for jobs, social welfare assistance and housing. The party has pledged to bar dual nationals from certain strategic state jobs in France. It wants to scrap nationality rights for children born and raised in France by foreign parents.Macron stunned and bewildered his own government and supporters with his decision this month to dissolve parliament and call snap elections after his centrist, pro-European grouping was trounced by the RN in EU elections. He argued that he was calling the vote to “clarify” the French political landscape.",Far-right National Rally in reach of being dominant French party after election first round,20,8
359,"Voter turnout across France has surged to a near four-decade high as voters cast their ballots in the first round of high stakes, snap parliamentary elections that could lead to the far-right party of Marine Le Pen forming a government in a historic first.While polls suggest support for Le Pen’s far-right, anti-immigrant National Rally (RN) has strengthened in recent days, the outcome of the two-round election, called three weeks ago by the president, Emmanuel Macron, following the crushing defeat of his allies in the European parliamentary elections, remains highly uncertain.With three hours remaining until polls closed on Sunday, voter turnout had reached 59.39% – an increase of nearly 20 points compared with the 2022 elections, according to the interior ministry. Turnout is estimated to be the highest since the 1986 legislative vote, the research director for Ipsos France, Mathieu Gallard, told Reuters.The high turnout is likely to mean that many more third-place candidates will make it to the second round of the election, Mujtaba Rahman, Eurasia Group’s managing director for Europe, said on social media. “Why does that matter? It allows Left and the Macron centre to make deals to withdraw (the) worst-placed candidates and allow the others a free run against the Far Right candidate in Round 2,” he wrote.The outcome of these tactical alliances could decide whether the RN “approaches” a majority in the second round, he added.In the lead-up to Sunday’s election, one poll carried out for Les Echos newspaper suggested that the RN was on course to win 37% of the national vote, up two points from more than a week ago, while another poll carried out for BFM TV estimated the far-right party could win between 260 and 295 seats – potentially giving it an outright majority among France’s 577 constituencies.Related: Macron told ‘people detest you’ as far-right bids to be biggest party in FrancePolls suggest the New Popular Front (NFP), a broad but fragile leftwing alliance, could receive 28% of the vote while Macron’s centrist bloc trails behind at 20%.Official campaigning for the first-round vote ended at midnight on Friday. Following Sunday’s vote, campaigning will resume on Monday for a further five days before voters are called back to the polls for a final, decisive second-round ballot on 7 July.Much could change in the five days between rounds, particularly if candidates embrace tactical alliances and withdrawals in order to block the far-right from winning a majority.In recent days, candidates from the leftwing coalition and Macron’s centrist alliance have scrambled to remind voters that the RN, launched in the early 1970s as the National Front, once included in its ranks former members of a Waffen-SS military unit under Nazi command during the second world war.The party was long seen as rife with antisemitic, homophobic and racist views, and widely regarded as a danger to democracy that needed to be kept out of mainstream politics. While Marine Le Pen, Jean-Marie Le Pen’s daughter, has spent much of the past decade working to soften the party’s image, its core message remains one of deep hostility to immigration and the so-called Islamisation of society.The party has vowed to drastically slash immigration and bar dual nationals from certain state jobs, along with promises to cut taxes on energy, exempt people under the age of 30 from income tax and work towards abolishing Macron’s pension reform.Ahead of Sunday’s first round, Le Pen urged voters to go out and vote. “Victory is within our grasp, so let’s seize this historic opportunity and get out and vote!” she wrote on social media.Most analysts suggest the most likely outcome is a polarised parliament, where consensus between the larger far-right and leftwing blocs, and a smaller number of Macron’s allies would be nearly impossible, leading to political paralysis.If the RN wins a majority, the party chief, Jordan Bardella, Le Pen’s 28-year-old protege who has no governing experience, could become prime minister in a fraught cohabitation with Macron.The result could pit the two men – who have vastly different visions of France’s future – against each other. One example is France’s strong support for Ukraine, championed by Macron since Russia’s 2022 invasion. Bardella has said he would use his powers as prime minister to stop Macron from continuing to supply long-range weapons to Ukraine.Following Sunday’s first-round vote, Macron is planning to convene a government meeting to decide the further course of action, government sources told AFP.The president’s shock decision to call parliamentary elections has sparked dissent among his allies and cast Europe’s second-biggest economy into uncertainty. Even so, Macron has stood by his decision, reportedly hoping it will force voters to confront whether they are ready to allow the far-right to tighten its grip on power.In the lead-up to Sunday’s first round vote, Macron sought to hammer home this point, warning that France risked being plunged into a “civil war” if either of his “extreme” opponents won a majority.The president has insisted he will serve out the remainder of his second term until 2027, regardless of which party wins.",Voter turnout in France’s parliamentary election at near-40-year high,19,8
210,"Rishi Sunak has told voters that Vladimir Putin is hoping for a Labour victory as the general election campaign enters its final week.Speaking to The Telegraph, the Prime Minister said the UK’s staunch support for Ukraine meant that “Russia does not want us to be re-elected”.In a final appeal to stave off a Labour super-majority, he also accused Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, of “appeasing” Moscow, and claimed that Sir Keir Starmer would cut defence spending “on day one”.Mr Sunak said: “The Conservatives have stood up to our adversaries to protect British interests and British values time and time again. We have stood shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine against Russian aggression, and we will keep doing so if re-elected.“It is clear from the evidence Russia does not want us to be re-elected. Putin would like nothing more than for Britain to step back, to appease his aggression rather than face it down, and that is what will happen with another party in power.“Nigel Farage has talked of appeasing Russia, which will only play into Putin’s hands, and Labour will cut UK defence spending on day one. This will embolden our enemies and send a signal to our allies that Britain is not with them any more. We cannot allow that to happen. Vote Conservative on July 4.”His last-minute intervention came amid reports that Russia was attempting to bolster Reform’s prospects with a coordinated social media campaign.The Australian Broadcasting Corporation claimed to have uncovered a network of five Facebook pages “spreading Kremlin talking points” ahead of the election, with some encouraging support for Mr Farage’s party.It is understood that Richard Holden, the Conservative chairman, has written to Simon Case, Britain’s top civil servant, and Sir Tim Barrow, the national security adviser, urging them to investigate.Polls show the Tories heading for a landmark defeat. They go into Thursday’s election 20 points behind Labour, and face being reduced to just 100 seats. The intervention is a sign of a change of policy at Conservative headquarters, moving from ignoring the threat posed by Reform to attacking Mr Farage’s party.On Saturday night, the Reform leader was embarrassed by a stunt from Led by Donkeys, a campaign group, when a banner featuring a smiling Putin and the phrase “I [heart] Nigel” dropped down behind him on stage.Mr Farage dismissed claims that Russian-inspired bots were interfering in the election as “cobblers”.The Tories are also keen to highlight what they see as Labour’s failings on defence. Although Sir Keir’s party has pledged to increase defence spending to 2.5 per cent of national income, it has not – unlike the Conservatives – put a date on it.Interviewed by the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday, Pat McFadden, Labour’s election coordinator, was unable to explain why the party had not made the commitment on defence but had done so on other issues.Oliver Dowden, the Deputy Prime Minister, warned voters of “buyer’s remorse” if they allowed a Labour election victory, telling Sky News: “What I would say is just think, think in six months time how you’re going to feel. I have a strong feeling the shine is going to come off Labour pretty quickly.“The buyer’s remorse will set in, and the bigger the Labour majority, the bigger the buyer’s remorse. Everyone still has it in their hands to stop that. Mark my words – dogs bark, cats meow, Labour put up taxes.”Mr Dowden went on to say the alleged Facebook plot was a “classic example” of Russian interference, adding that “hostile state actors” – with Russia as a “prime example” – had been attempting to influence the outcome of the election.Asked whether he was accusing Putin of backing Mr Farage, he told Sunday With Trevor Phillips, on Sky News: “There is a threat in all elections – and indeed we see it in this election – from hostile state actors seeking to influence the outcome of the election campaign. Russia is a prime example of this, and this is a classic example from the Russian playbook.”The pages uncovered by ABC, with a combined following of 190,000, are said to bear “the hallmarks of a Russian influence operation”. The broadcaster said they featured criticism of several political parties including the Conservatives and Labour, with some expressing support for Mr Farage and two reportedly describing him as “the people’s champion”.On Monday, Mr Sunak will warn that an unchecked Labour government “would be a disaster from which it would take decades to recover”.Speaking at a rally, he will say: “We have four days to save Britain from a Labour government. Labour would hike taxes by more than £2,000 for every working family, would shunt our politics to the Left and change the rules to ensure that they can stay in power for decades.“If they get the kind of majority, the super-majority that the polls suggest, they will set about entrenching themselves in power. They will rewrite the rules to make it easier for them to stay in office and harder for anyone to replace them. So don’t surrender your voice to Labour on Thursday.“I tell you this – once you have handed Keir Starmer and Labour a blank cheque, you won’t be able to get it back. A Labour government would be bad for our country, and an unchecked Labour government would be a disaster from which it would take decades to recover.”Meanwhile, Sir Keir will embark on a three-day tour of the country in a final bid to persuade voters to back Labour. Mr McFadden said: “This week, people across the country face a clear choice – five more years of chaos with the Conservatives, or Keir Starmer’s changed Labour Party offering to turn the page and start to rebuild.“If people don’t want to wake up on July 5 to five more years of economic chaos, to wake up knowing that all the future offers is the same as the recent Tory past, then they have to vote Labour and vote for change on Thursday. Change will only come if you vote Labour on July 4.”","Putin wants Labour election victory, claims Sunak",20,11
61,"France goes to the polls on Sunday July 7 for the second round of its most crucial election in decades.In the first round last night, the hard-Right National Rally took the biggest share of the vote, winning 33 per cent, while the Left-wing New Popular Front is expected to come second with about 28 per cent and Mr Macron’s Together coalition was in third with 20 per cent, according to the interior ministry.President Emmanuel Macron called the vote after he was trounced by Marine Le Pen’s National Rally in European elections in June. It was a momentous decision that shocked France and took Mr Macron’s closest aides by surprise, according to some reports.Mr Macron said at the time the European results forced his hand in declaring this election, which he had hoped would be a chance for voters to reject the hard-Right and put him back in the driving seat.But critics said it was a reckless gamble which could backfire spectacularly by propelling the hard-Right into government.When is the French election and how will it work?The first round of legislative elections to choose députés (MPs) for France’s National Assembly (lower house of parliament) took place on June 30. The more than 60 candidates who received more than 50 per cent of the vote in their constituency were automatically elected. All others will go to a run-off vote on July 7.Any candidate who secured the support of more than 12.5 per cent of registered voters in the first round will progress to the second. Whoever gets the most votes in the second round wins the seat.In many districts, three people made it to the second round, though some tactics to block hard-Right candidates have already been announced: The Left-wing coalition said it would withdraw its candidates in districts when they arrived in third position in order to support other politicians opposed to the far Right.In the first round, voters tend to choose with their hearts not their heads, picking the candidate who best reflects their values. But in the second round, it becomes more tactical. Sometimes a weaker candidate steps aside so it becomes a two-horse race, for example between a mainstream candidate and hard-Right candidate. This can allow voters of various views to band together to block a rival whom they deem beyond the pale.The alliance which manages to secure a majority in the lower house of parliament then forms a government to serve under the president.When will the results be announced?The second round of voting is due to take place on Sunday July 7.Voting ends at 8pm local time (7pm BST), when pollsters publish nationwide projections based on a partial vote count.These are usually reliable, with official results trickling in from 8pm.Vote counting is usually fast and efficient and the winners of all, or nearly all, seats will be known by the end of the evening.Who is in the running?The frontrunner in this race is the hard-Right National Rally, led by Marine Le Pen in parliament and overall by Jordan Bardella, a youthful, energetic new face in the party.In second place is a Left-wing alliance, the Popular Front, formed from centre-Left, hard-Left and Green parties.Trailing them both in third place is Mr Macron’s centrist alliance Ensemble, which has been on the ropes since losing its absolute majority in parliament in 2022.It remains unclear whether any party or alliance - most likely the National Rally - will manage to secure an absolute majority in parliament.President Macron is expected to remain in office regardless, but without a majority he will have to engage in a French political system called “cohabitation”.What is cohabitation?When the president’s own alliance has no majority, he must appoint a prime minister from the alliance which beat him; this is very rare.It has happened only three times in the history of the modern Republic, once when Jacques Chirac, conservative president, appointed Lionel Jospin, the socialist prime minister, in 1997.Whoever that prime minister might be – the polls suggest the National Rally leader – they will be accountable to parliament, lead the government and introduce bills.The president retains some authority over foreign policy, such as holding the nuclear codes, and in theory they can veto the prime minister’s laws, though parliament can overrule this with its majority.If the National Rally secures an absolute majority, Mr Macron will be left as a lame duck.What are the possible outcomes?This is an election like no other in France: campaign time is short, the electoral landscape is shaken, and so other scenarios cannot be excluded.These include a paralysed National Assembly divided into three groups with no one party dominating it, or an alliance of mainstream parties to keep the hard-Right out of power. An absolute majority requires at least 289 seats.Ms Le Pen’s National Rally could run a minority government if it wins the most seats without reaching that threshold, but 28-year-old party leader Mr Bardella has said he wants an absolute majority as without it he will not be able to carry out reforms.What happens if there’s no majority?The president can name a prime minister from the parliamentary group with the most seats at the National Assembly — this was the case of Mr Macron’s own centrist alliance since 2022.Yet the National Rally already said it would reject such an option, because it would mean a far-Right government could soon be overthrown through a no-confidence vote if other political parties join together.The president could try to build a broad coalition from the left to the right, an option that sounds unlikely, given the political divergences.Prime Minister Gabriel Attal hoped Sunday to be able to have enough centrist lawmakers to build “a majority of projects and ideas” with other “Republican forces,” which may include those from the centre-Left and the centre-Right.Experts said another complex option would be to appoint “a government of experts” unaffiliated with political parties but which would still need to be accepted by a majority at the National Assembly. Such a government would likely deal mostly with day-to-day affairs rather than implementing major reforms.Why has Emmanuel Macron called an election?Critics of Mr Macron will argue this was a hubristic move that dooms his leadership and will hasten the rise of the hard-Right in France.Ms Le Pen has for years been working hard to clean up her party’s image and style herself as the co-leader of a new party of government. Now that goal is tantalisingly close, thanks in large part to Mr Macron’s decision.However, the French president was already under immense pressure from the National Rally due to its soaring popularity over the course of his presidency. In calling the election, he has an opportunity to take the initiative and fight on his own terms.And at first this tactic did seem effective: it initially threw the French Right into total disarray as they argued over the shape of their anti-Macron alliance.Unfortunately for the president, it did not catch the French Left off-guard in the same way; they swiftly formed a cogent alliance which has now taken second place, ahead of Mr Macron. Meanwhile, the hard-Right managed to surge into first place.",France election 2024: Everything you need to know,20,11

348,"There is a story that Sir Keir Starmer’s friends like to tell about his response to Labour’s humiliating Hartlepool by-election defeat in 2021.Having lost the safe seat to the Conservatives, Sir Keir openly discussed quitting as the Labour leader, saying: “I’m not fulfilling some lifelong dream here.” He told his confidants he would be content to work in a bookshop instead.It is undoubtedly true that Sir Keir’s leadership ambitions came late in life. It is also the case that Labour never expected him to be the party’s next prime minister, and from the public’s point of view there is still considerable confusion over what he stands for.Yet opinion polls consistently point to Sir Keir – who came so close to walking off the political stage entirely – as the next occupant of 10 Downing Street.Read the latest election pollsFollow The Telegraph’s general election live coverageThat he has turned a 20-point deficit in those polls into a 21-point lead in his time as leader owes much to the Tories’ self-immolation, but it would be wrong to dismiss Sir Keir’s contribution to that turnaround.Keir Starmer working in his flat above a sauna and massage parlour in the 1980s - HARPER COLLINSBy purging Labour of Momentum, Jeremy Corbyn and anti-Semites, Sir Keir has done much to detoxify the brand. Before voters go to the polls, however, they will want to be sure that they know what they are getting if they are tempted to vote Labour – and that means knowing more about the man who leads the party.Even Sir Keir’s tame biographer Tom Baldwin, a former adviser to their mutual friend Ed Miliband, describes him as “peculiarly hard to pin down”, which is not an encouraging start for those tasked with curating the image of a would-be prime minister.Sir Keir has summed up his political outlook by saying: “If I see something wrong or spot an injustice, I want to put it right,” a phrase that might have been uttered by any politician, of any party, at any point in time.He has also proudly described how one of his achievements as director of public prosecutions (DPP) was “getting the boring stuff right”.In time, that phrase might be equally applicable as a description of how he ended up in charge of the country at the age of 61.Sir Keir said he got 'the boring stuff right' during his time as director of public prosecutions - JOHN STILLWELL/PAUnlike Sir Tony Blair, the last Labour leader to win a general election, Sir Keir can genuinely lay claim to working-class roots. But where Sir Tony was unapologetic about his middle-class status, Starmer appears uncomfortable with the man he has become.Sir Keir has so often referred to his father’s occupation as a toolmaker that it has become the go-to punchline for political cartoonists.Much ink has been expended in arguing about whether Rodney Starmer was a mere factory hand or the boss of his own one-man business, but there is no doubting the fact that Sir Keir’s childhood was lived in straitened circumstances that moulded the man we see today.Sir Keir was born on Sep 2, 1962, the second of four children. His older sister, Anna, was born the year before him and twins, Katy and Nick, followed in 1964.Soon after he was born, the family moved to the pebble-dashed home in Hurst Green, near Oxted, to which he so often refers, saying it gave the family stability.Money was tight: Katy has said that the house flooded once and it was years before they could afford to redecorate, and when Sir Keir kicked a football through a back window his father boarded it up, unable to pay for a glazer.His mother Josephine, a nurse, had Still’s disease, a rare type of inflammatory arthritis which meant she had to have her hips and knees replaced twice and became a wheelchair user in later life.Some of Sir Keir’s friends have suggested in the past that if he appears lacking in emotion, it is a result of growing up with a parent who had a serious illness, which leads a child to suppress their own needs and feelings.Added to that was the fact that his brother Nick had learning difficulties, which meant Sir Keir’s parents had a lot on their hands.He was not afraid to use his fists as a child and would get into fights with people who bullied his brother, with whom he shared a bunk bed decorated with posters of Debbie Harry, the Blondie singer.He now says he has no patience for people who complain about being ill when they are not very ill, and that the challenges he faces as a politician “pale into insignificance” compared with what his mother had to face.Childhood friends of Sir Keir say his father, a staunch Labour supporter, was powerfully built and physically intimidating and would interrogate visitors about their political views.Sir Keir has gone as far as to say that his father was “a difficult sod” who “drove people away” and had no time for other people’s opinions. Family meals would be eaten in silence while Mr Starmer read his newspaper, and he only allowed a television in the house when Josephine took an Open University course (Sir Keir was only allowed to watch one programme per week: Match of the Day).Sir Keir now thinks his father “carried quite heavily” a belief that other people looked down on him because he was a manual worker, even though he believes he was bright enough to have gone to university if he had lived in a different era.Sir Keir at his wedding with wife Victoria, father Rodney and mother Josephine, who has Still's disease - KEIR STARMER/LABOUR PARTYFamily holidays were spent in the Lake District when the four children and their four dogs would all cram into the back seat of Mr Starmer’s Ford Cortina.Mr and Mrs Starmer fell in love with the Lakes when they went there on honeymoon (the only time in her life that Josephine flew on an aircraft, to Manchester) and visited 77 times. They also became lifelong friends with Alfred Wainwright, the Lakeland author, after coming across him in the hills.The four Starmer siblings all attended a primary school in the village of Merle Common, around four miles from Tanhouse Road. Sir Keir passed the 11-plus and went to Reigate Grammar School, unlike his three siblings, who called him “superboy” because he was so good at everything, from academia to music to football.He became such an accomplished flautist that on Saturdays he went to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, where he had a youth scholarship. Unsurprisingly, he also became a prefect and attained a Gold Duke of Edinburgh’s Award.His attendance at Reigate Grammar School would prove controversial in later life. It would have become a comprehensive school had it not been for a directive issued by Margaret Thatcher as education secretary, and instead went private, though boys who were already at the school, including Sir Keir, did not have to pay.Keir Starmer in his first year at Reigate Grammar School in 1974 - HARPER COLLINSCuriously, Sir Keir omitted any mention of the school in his Who’s Who entry when he first became DPP. He now wants to put VAT on school fees yet he has contributed to Reigate’s scholarship fund and has spoken at fundraising events. The Daily Mail has given him an “A* for hypocrisy” as a result.After a gap year which he divided between an outdoor pursuits centre for disabled children near Bodmin Moor and working in his father’s workshop, he won a place at the University of Leeds to study law, gaining a first-class degree.During his time there he went on demonstrations and gave money to miners’ families during the strike in 1984, but he refuses to answer questions about whether he took drugs as a student, preferring to say he “had a very good time at university”. It included dating Angela O’Brien, a fellow law student with whom he had a 10-year relationship.He also joined the university Labour Club, though he never ran for any posts within it and many prominent members of it have no memory of him attending at all. Like Lord Cameron, Sir Keir seems to have treated student politics as a passing interest rather than an all-consuming passion.A one-year Bachelor of Civil Law course at St Edmund Hall, University of Oxford followed, before a three-year spell working as the legal officer for Liberty, then called the National Council for Civil Liberties. At weekends, he gave free legal advice to women who worked in a massage parlour below his flat, that may or may not have been an actual massage parlour.Sir Keir Starmer celebrating his first-class degree in Law from the University of Leeds with his parents Rod and Jo in 1985 - HARPER COLLINSFreed from the intensity of his university studies, Sir Keir finally had time to devote to his hobby of politics and decided that the Labour Party was not radical enough for his liking. He joined the Socialist Society, founded by Ralph Miliband, Ed and David’s father, and Tony Benn, and helped set up a magazine called Socialist Alternatives, dedicated to an obscure branch of Trotskyism called Pabloism. It attacked Neil Kinnock’s “hopeless” economic programme and demanded a “radical alternative”.At the time, Sir Keir had such liberal beliefs on law and order that one friend has recalled him saying he did not believe in imprisonment “for anything, ever”.He expressed similarly naive views when he was interviewed for pupillage at his first barrister’s chambers. Asked how he would defend a first-time shoplifter he said: “Isn’t all property theft?”Nevertheless, he was taken on by Doughty Street Chambers, founded by the prominent human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson. Its premises were next door to the offices of the Spectator magazine, edited at the time by Boris Johnson.Sir Keir made a name for himself by giving free legal advice to the defendants in the “McLibel” case, in which McDonald’s sued two environmental activists over a factsheet critical of the burger chain. He appeared in a documentary about the case talking about how being made a Queen’s Counsel was odd because he used to campaign for the abolition of the monarchy.By 1997 he had made enough money as a barrister to buy a house in Stoke Newington with his new girlfriend and fellow barrister, Phillippa Kaufmann.They were together for six years and she still lives in the house they bought together. Then came a relationship with another lawyer, Julie Morris, a former gymnast, before Sir Keir met the woman he would finally marry, solicitor Victoria Alexander.Sir Keir's wife Victoria worked as a volunteer at Sir Tony Blair's campaign headquarters in 1997 - GETTYVictoria, who worked as a volunteer at Sir Tony’s campaign headquarters in 1997, is a decade younger than her husband and was far more politically active as a student than he had been.Her father was part of a Jewish family who arrived in England from Poland before the Second World War.The couple married on May 6, 2007, at the Fennes Estate in Essex, when Sir Keir was 44. By 2010 they had a son and a daughter, whom they occasionally take to a liberal synagogue in north London (though neither Sir Keir nor his wife professes to be religious).Back at Doughty Street Chambers, Sir Keir was busily fighting the government over the ongoing Iraq War, taking on, and beating, the Home Office in a series of cases that prevented control orders being imposed on suspected terrorists whom the security services feared would travel to Iraq to fight against the US-led coalition.By 2008 he had built such a legend within the legal world that he was offered the job of DPP, putting him in charge of 8,000 people in the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and hundreds of thousands of prosecutions.He has picked out one of his key achievements as replacing a paper-based system with a digital one, which meant fewer prosecutions were abandoned because of lost paperwork. It is this that he has cited as an example of how “getting the boring stuff right” can improve lives.One thing he did not do as DPP was prosecute Jimmy Savile. It was under his watch that the CPS decided not to prosecute the prolific paedophile on the grounds of insufficient evidence, a decision that was later criticised in a review of the case by a leading barrister. Sir Keir has always maintained the case did not come across his desk.One of the unfortunate consequences of the missed opportunity over Savile was Operation Midland, which dragged innocent men into an investigation about a VIP paedophile ring that was the invention of a fantasist called Carl Beech.After the Savile debacle, Sir Keir had authorised policy changes for dealing with sexual abuse cases that placed more emphasis on believing the purported victim.Sir Keir is often blamed for the 'believe the victim' mentality that allowed fantastist Carl Beech's claims to go unquestioned for so long - DAVID ROSEThe former Tory MP Harvey Proctor, who was falsely accused by Beech, blames Sir Keir personally for the “believe the victim” policy that cost him his job, his reputation and his home after he was wrongly accused. Some of Beech’s victims later said Sir Keir was unfit to stand as Labour leader.By the 2010s, Sir Keir had decided that he had achieved as much as he could as a lawyer. He told his biographer Tom Baldwin that there were limits to legal justice and he wanted to be part of the apparatus of making the laws.“I had a sense that to fix problems you had to pull levers only politicians could do,” he said. “I wanted to be part of making social justice.”He consulted his near neighbour Ed Miliband, who lives half a mile from him, and when Frank Dobson stood down from the Holborn and St Pancras seat in 2015, Sir Keir was picked as the candidate to replace him.He has lived in the constituency for more than 20 years, has a wallet with “Take Me Home To Kentish Town” written on the back, and is, of course, a fanatical supporter of Arsenal FC.He still plays football with friends he has had for decades, does so wearing a Donegal County Gaelic football shirt that he picked up when he was in Northern Ireland advising its police force, and, until recently at least, remained in charge of booking the pitch, team selection and contacting the players with details of when to arrive.Sir Keir pictured playing football in a Dongeal Gaelic Football top in North London in 2021 - GAVIN RODGERS/PIXEL8000When he was elected to Parliament at the age of 52, it would have been a proud moment for his mother, who had been struggling with her health, but she did not live to see it. In 2008 she had fallen and broken her leg, which had to be amputated. She also lost the power of speech.Mr Starmer used his engineering skills to make her a wheelchair adapted to her exact needs, and built an outhouse at the end of their garden where she could sit and be near the donkeys that the couple rescued and kept in a field that their MP son had bought for them.Mr Starmer planned out how he would get his disabled wife to Parliament to see his eldest son being sworn in as an MP in 2015, but she died a few days before he was elected, and Mr Starmer decided not to go on his own.Heartbroken, he moved into the outhouse he had built for his wife, putting her wedding ring beside the bed. He visited her grave most days, having his sandwich lunch there, even on Christmas Day.When Mr Starmer himself later ended up in hospital, there was a fire in the outhouse, destroying all of the photos and memories of their life together, and killing his dog. His children never told him, and he died in hospital without knowing. Sir Keir later found a scrapbook his father had kept, full of cuttings about his career, and friends said that after his wife died, they would find Mr Starmer sitting watching the BBC Parliament channel in the hope of catching sight of his son.In Parliament, Sir Keir chose to serve on Jeremy Corbyn’s front bench as shadow Brexit secretary, a decision that has dogged him ever since.He says he profoundly disagreed with Mr Corbyn, yet he stayed on his team. He says he accepts Brexit, but he campaigned for a second referendum, with Remain as an option. Rishi Sunak accuses him of blowing with the wind, unable to decide what he stands for other than seizing power.Sir Keir is a big football fan and supports Arsenal - LABOUR PARTYKnighted for his services as DPP, he insists on being called simply Keir Starmer in Parliament. Critics find this peculiar: his is a story of social mobility, of a man born without privilege who raised himself to high office through his own endeavours and with the help of an education system that includes good schools and world-class universities, yet he is somehow reluctant to celebrate this success. Instead, he constantly plays up his working-class roots, leaves his grammar school out of his biography and plays down his knighthood.Where Sir Tony had the self-confidence to own his middle-class status, turning it to his advantage by telling Tory voters he was not so different from them, Sir Keir, another north London lawyer, appears uncomfortable with his success, and this is surely one of the reasons that voters find him difficult to warm to.Colleagues say he first started talking about becoming leader when Mr Corbyn refused to blame Moscow for the Salisbury poisonings in 2018.In 2020 he got the job, making his victory speech from his living room because of the Covid pandemic. In it, he described anti-Semitism as “a stain on our party” and promised to “tear out this poison by its roots and judge success by the return of Jewish members and those who felt that they could no longer support us”.Many Labour MPs thought he didn’t have it in him. Yet he matched words with action, sacking his beaten leadership rival Rebecca Long-Bailey for sharing online an interview in which the actor Maxine Peake claimed the police who killed George Floyd in the US had learnt their techniques from the Israeli secret services.The decision infuriated the Left, but there was more to come, as Diane Abbott, and even his predecessor Mr Corbyn, lost the whip over comments he judged to be unacceptable.By January 2022, around three hundred members had been expelled by the party, often after complaints of anti-Semitism, and thousands of Mr Corbyn’s supporters had quit.Sir Keir had purged his party of its most toxic elements, and in doing so removed the biggest barrier to Labour being electable.Otherwise, he made an unimpressive start as Labour leader. A poor communicator, he was regularly duffed up at the despatch box by Boris Johnson, who loved to goad him with the nickname Captain Hindsight (later promoted to General Indecision).By May 2021, after Labour lost the Hartlepool by-election, questions were being asked about whether Sir Keir might be the first Labour leader since George Lansbury in 1935 to step down without fighting an election. As noted above, he certainly considered it, telling friends he saw it as a personal rejection and that people would see it as the party going backwards.Sir Keir’s job, at that stage, was simply to win back enough seats from the Conservatives to give the next leader a genuine crack at power. After all, no party in history had overturned the sort of majority won by Boris Johnson in 2019 in one single leap.Then came partygate, Liz Truss, and a collapse in support for the Tory Party that no one could have foreseen.It has left Sir Keir as the odds-on favourite to be the next prime minister. It appears he might get there simply by “getting the boring stuff right”.",Keir Starmer profile: The grammar school ‘superboy’ who could be the next Labour PM,20,11
107,"Key results to watch out forWhen was the 2019 election result called?Hour-by-hour timetable of the night2am: Kemi Badenoch’s North West Essex 4am: Rishi Sunak’s Richmond and Northallerton constituencyWhen polls close on Thursday after a six-week campaign, Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer will eagerly await results from the UK’s 650 constituencies to find out who will become the next prime minister.The exit poll at 10pm will give the Prime Minister and the Labour leader a snapshot of what to expect nationally, before the first results start to trickle in across the following hours.Opinion polls in recent weeks have suggested the Conservatives are on track to win as few as 53 seats, although other surveys suggest they could win around 150. Labour is currently projected to win a landslide, with some polls suggesting Sir Keir could achieve a greater victory margin than Sir Tony Blair.A recent Telegraph poll predicted Mr Sunak could become the first ever Prime Minister to lose his seat at a general election.Read the latest election pollsFollow The Telegraph’s general election live coverageUse our tool below to find out when your constituency is expected to declare:When will election results be announced?Results from the 2024 general election will begin to trickle in from around 11.30pm on Thursday after polling stations close at 10pm.Most of the constituency results are expected in the early hours of Friday, as hundreds are announced across the country, with the final seats projected to announce their winning candidates by 6.30am.In 2019, the first declaration came at 11.27pm when Newcastle City Council beat local rival Sunderland to announce Chi Onwurah, Labour’s candidate, as the first MP of the new parliament.The record for the earliest declaration remains 10.43pm by the former seat of Sunderland South in 2001.What are some of the key results to watch out for?All eyes will be on Richmond and Northallerton at around 4am when Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, will find out whether he has kept his seat, amid some predictions that he could be ousted by his constituents in what would be a historic defeat for an incumbent of Downing Street.The result in Holborn and St Pancras, the constituency of Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, is expected 15 minutes later.A host of top Tories will learn throughout the night whether they have won re-election, including Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg (around 4.30am), Grant Shapps, the Defence Secretary (around 3.30am) and Jeremy Hunt, the Chancellor (around 3.30am). Mr Hunt has predicted there will be fewer than 1,500 votes between him and the Liberal Democrat hopeful.Nigel Farage, the Reform leader, will learn at around 4am whether he has succeeded at the eighth time in trying in winning a seat in the Commons.An hour earlier, Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader, is set to find out whether he will beat his old party and retain his seat in Islington North, where he is standing as an independent candidate.When was the 2019 election result called?Boris Johnson won a landslide victory for the Tories in 2019 after selling the public on his mandate to “get Brexit done”.The first exit poll came back as Big Ben struck 10pm and polling stations closed nationwide, while Mr Johnson’s overall majority was confirmed at 5am.By 7am, it became clear the Tories were on course for their biggest majority at Westminster since that of Margaret Thatcher.What happens when results start being called?When voting closes, an exit poll will be announced following a survey of voters taken from about 150 constituencies in England, Scotland and Wales, giving an indication of the likely result.However, leaders will have to wait until one party receives enough votes for a majority under the first-past-the-post electoral system.In 2019, Mr Johnson’s majority was announced at 5am, although it was not until every constituency had called its results that the extent of his landslide victory with a 43 per cent vote share emerged.When is the general election?The UK will head to the polls on Thursday July 4 to vote on the country’s next leader, with polling stations open between 7am and 10pm.The Prime Minister announced the snap summer election in a rain-sodden speech outside Downing Street on May 22, setting in motion the vote six weeks later.Registration for the general election has now closed and it is too late to apply for a postal vote. However, those eligible can still use a proxy ballot to have someone vote on their behalf.Hour-by-hour timetable of the nightThursday, 10pmIt’s exit poll o’clock at 10pm, as a nationwide projection offers a unique window on the outcome.The 10pm ballot has an impressive track record and gives a pretty good indication of what the final result will be.11pmBlyth and Ashington, a new constituency where veteran Labour MP Ian Lavery is seeking re-election, is expected to be the first constituency to declare at this election, with an estimated time of 11.30pm. Shortly after will be the seat of Houghton and Sunderland South, represented for the past 14 years by shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson.23:30 Blyth and Ashington23:45 Houghton and Sunderland South12am There is the potential for an early shock as Richard Holden, the Conservative Party chairman, finds out whether he has done enough to win his new seat of Basildon and Billericay. Mr Holden was selected as the Tory candidate for what has traditionally been a safe seat in a one-man shortlist, prompting local activists to brand the process a “stitch-up”.00:15 Basildon and Billericay and Broxbourne00:30 Sunderland Central and Swindon South00:45 Washington and Gateshead SouthFriday, 1amThe first results from Scotland will provide an early indication as to how the SNP may fare following a difficult couple of years for the Scottish nationalist party, which has seen it change First Minister twice and tank in the polls.01:00 Makerfield, Rutherglen, Tynemouth and Wigan01:15 Newcastle upon Tyne Central and West, Newcastle upon Tyne East and Wallsend and Newcastle upon Tyne North01:30 Barnsley North and Barnsley South01:30 East Kilbride and Strathaven, Leigh and Atherton, Putney and Tooting01:45 Hamilton and Clyde Valley, Harrogate and Knaresborough, Leicester South and North Swindon2amDeclarations will start to come in thick and fast at this point. Seats up for grabs include North West Essex which is currently represented by Kemi Badenoch, the Business Secretary and the bookmakers’ favourite to succeed Rishi Sunak as Tory leader.The results in Burnley, which returned a Conservative MP for the first time in 109 years in 2019, and Redcar, which elected its first ever Tory last time out, will provide an indication of how Mr Sunak’s party is faring in the ‘Red Wall’ seats that were so crucial to Boris Johnson’s triumph.Another constituency to watch is Rochdale, where Workers’ Party candidate George Galloway shocked Westminster by winning a by-election in February with a campaign heavily focused on Gaza. Labour, however, is hopeful that it can win the seat back.02:00 North West Cambridgeshire, Cannock Chase, Castle Point, Darlington, Dunbartonshire West, Dundee Central, North West Essex, Gateshead Central and Whickham, Glenrothes and Mid Fife, Havant, Hexham, Leicester East, Lewisham East, Lewisham West and East Dulwich, Middlesbrough and Thornaby East, Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, North Down, Peterborough, Redcar, South Shields, Strangford, Swansea West, Torbay, Tyrone West, Vale of Glamorgan, North Warwickshire and Bedworth02:15 Gower, Knowsley, Leicester West, Paisley and Renfrewshire South, Rayleigh and Wickford02:30 Arbroath and Broughty Ferry, Battersea, Blackburn, Caerphilly, Chorley, Clwyd North, Colchester, North Durham, Easington, Heywood and Middleton North, Jarrow and Gateshead East, Kilmarnock and Loudoun, Lewisham North.

He faces a challenge from the Liberal DemocratsCabinet ministers Gillian Keegan, Claire Coutinho, Alex Chalk, Simon Hart and Penny Mordaunt will also find out whether they have done enough to win re-election. Ms Mordaunt, the Leader of the Commons, is touted as a potential future Tory leader but faces a tight battle in her Portsmouth North constituency.Other top Tories whose results we can expect around this time include Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former leader, and Robert Jenrick, a former immigration minister.While Labour is projected to perform well nationally, its shadow culture secretary Thangam Debbonaire faces a tense moment as the Greens seek to deliver an upset in her Bristol Central constituency.Speaking of upsets, Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader, will find out how he has fared against his old party as he stands as an independent in Islington North.

In this next hour, the result for Rishi Sunak’s Richmond and Northallerton constituency is expected. A shock constituency-level poll for The Telegraph suggested he could become the first ever sitting Prime Minister to lose their seat at a general election, so all eyes will be on the count.Fifteen minutes later, Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, will find out how he has fared in Holborn and St Pancras, although his re-election in a safe Labour seat is expected to be more of a formality.The surge of Reform UK has been one of the major stories of this election. Party leader Nigel Farage will hope he has won a seat in the Commons at the eighth time of trying as the result comes in for Clacton, while Richard Tice, the Reform chairman, is hoping to unseat former Tory minister Matt Warman by the seaside in Boston and Skegness.Reform’s only current MP is Lee Anderson, a former deputy Tory chairman who crossed the floor in March following his suspension. He is hoping the former mining town of Ashfield, which traditionally opted for Labour but went Tory in 2019, will stick with him after his change of allegiances, as many Labour-turned-Tory voters now consider Reform.Shabana Mahmood and Jess Phillips, two Labour MPs in Birmingham, have faced a backlash from their voters over the party’s stance on Gaza, and the results in those constituencies will reveal how independent pro-Palestinian candidates have fared.How the Liberal Democrats have fared will be increasingly obvious from the results in North East Somerset and Hanham, currently held by Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, and Surrey Heath, which was Michael Gove’s seat before the Housing Secretary stood down shortly after Mr Sunak called the election.04:00: Aberafan Maesteg, Altrincham and Sale West,

91,"James Cleverly on Sky News this morning. Sky NewsA Sky News presenter this morning slammed James Cleverly over an “insidious” Tory policy which has saddled millions with higher tax bills.Matt Barbet took issue with the home secretary’s claim that the Conservatives are cutting taxes.He pointed out that the government’s decision to freeze salary thresholds - a process known as “fiscal drag” - has led to workers across the country paying more income tax.Cleverly admitted that taxes were “currently higher than we would like”, but blamed that on the cost of the pandemic and the spike in energy bills caused by the war in Ukraine.But Barbet said: “You’ve given with one hand in terms of the National Insurance cuts we’ve seen over the past few months, and taken more away with the other in terms of fiscal drag - more people being dragged into paying higher rates of income tax. That is an insidious policy, isn’t it?”The home secretary replied: “I’ve explained why taxes are currently higher than we would like because of those genuinely unique set of circumstances over the last couple of years.”Barbet also pointed out that corporation tax has gone up under the Tories, adding: “What does that do for business?”Cleverly said the Tories were “focusing on working people”.He added: “We’re determined to bring taxes down. We have started to do that and we have focused the initial work on those hardworking families who have struggled because of the war in Ukraine and Covid, and we are determined to do more.”Related...Desperate Rishi Sunak Goes Full Project Fear As Tories Brace For Election Wipeout'On The Brink Of Destruction': Trevor Phillips Tells Oliver Dowden The Tories Face Election WipeoutRishi Sunak Has Insisted He Is 'Proud' Of The Tories' Disastrous Election Campaign",'An Insidious Policy': Sky News Presenter Skewers James Cleverly Over Tory Tax Rises,20,3
378,"With only a few days left until polling day, Rishi Sunak is hoping his pitch to the country, the Conservative manifesto, will help the party pull off a surprise election comeback.The Prime Minister announced his election promises at Silverstone on June 11 under a banner reading “clear plan, bold action, secure future”.The document outlines a further 2 per cent tax cut to National Insurance, the construction of 1.6 million homes over the next Parliament and an increase of the child benefit threshold.Mr Sunak has faced an uphill battle since announcing the snap summer election and is looking to prevent his party from suffering a wipe-out at the hands of Labour, which leads the polls by 20 percentage points.Read the latest election pollsFollow The Telegraph’s general election live coverageBelow, The Telegraph lists the policies the Prime Minister laid out in the 76-page document and what this means for his chances of re-election.NHS and social careTax and spendingEconomyEnvironmentEnergy and ‘Net Zero’Education and childcareDefencePensions and welfarePolicing and crimeMigrationLevelling-UpNHS and social careIncrease NHS spending above inflation each yearDeliver 92,000 more nurses and 28,000 more doctors compared to 2023Deliver 40 new hospitals by 2030Drive up productivity in the NHS and move care closer to people’s homesProvide 2.5 million more NHS dental appointmentsHeadlining the manifesto’s section on health and social care is a pledge to continue to increase NHS spending above inflation in each year of the next parliament.To boost the NHS workforce, the Tories have vowed to deliver 92,000 more nurses and 28,000 more doctors in that time, compared to 2023 levels.The party is standing by Boris Johnson’s controversial pledge to deliver 40 new hospitals by 2030, while investing “proportionately more” in out-of-hospital services over time.It has also vowed to drive up productivity in the NHS and move care closer to people’s homes by utilising pharmacies, new and modernised GP surgeries and more community diagnostic centres.Meanwhile, the party promised to unlock 2.5 million more NHS dental appointments through its Dental Recovery Plan.The manifesto also states that the Tories are committed to supporting a “high-quality and sustainable social care system”, building on existing investment.At the next spending review, the party would give local authorities a “multi-year funding settlement to support social care”.Tax and spendingAbolish national insurance payments for 4m self-employedFurther 2p NI cut for salaried employeesScrap NI entirely “when financial conditions allow”Meet its fiscal rules of public sector net debt fallingReduce public sector net borrowing to below 3 per cent of GDP within five yearsAbolish Stamp Duty on homes worth up to £425,000The Tories have put lower taxes at the heart of their manifesto, with a surprise pledge to abolish National Insurance payments for almost all self-employed people.Mr Sunak said that more than nine in 10 self-employed Brits - some four million workers - would be exempted from the levy under his party’s plans.But under the Tory plans 7 per cent of the highest earning self-employed workers would continue to pay National Insurance.The party would only abolish the main rate of the levy, which is charged at 6 per cent of self-employed earnings between £12,570 and £50,270.An upper rate of 2 per cent, which is applied to profits over £50,270, will remain in place.He said the announcement was “a further downpayment” on the Conservatives’ long-term ambition to abolish the levy entirely.Employee national insurance would also be cut by a further 2p, taking the tax to 6 per cent by April 2027. The party said this would amount to a total tax cut of £1,350 for the average worker on £35,000.It also reiterated its “long-term ambition” to scrap the “double tax on work” entirely when financial conditions allow.The manifesto also includes a pledge to abolish Stamp Duty on homes worth up to £425,000 for first-time buyers and to reintroduce the Help to Buy scheme.EconomyVow not to raise corporation taxEase burden of business rates for high street, leisure and hospitality firmsKeep the VAT threshold “under review”Return the size of the Civil Service to pre-pandemic levels to cut “government bureaucracy”Funnel civil service savings into defenceThe Tories said the “only way to give people peace of mind” that the UK can weather further global shocks is to “get borrowing and debt down”.Therefore, in the next Parliament, the party pledged to continue to meet its fiscal rules of having public sector net debt falling, and for public sector net borrowing to be below 3 per cent of GDP in the fifth year of the forecast.It said the measures in the manifesto are “fully funded” and “would result in lower borrowing in 2029-30”.The Conservatives promised to “always be the party of business”, with a vow not to raise corporation tax. They would also “continue to ease the burden of business rates” for high street, leisure and hospitality firms and keep the VAT threshold “under review”.Read the full 2024 Liberal Democrat manifesto hereMeanwhile, the party pledged to cut “government bureaucracy” by returning the size of the Civil Service to pre-pandemic levels, with the savings funnelled into defence spending.EnvironmentWater bosses to lose bonuses if their firm commits serious criminal breachInvest water company fines in river restoration projectsMore affordable housing for local people in rural areasEmpower councils to manage the growth of holiday letsExpand the UK’s Blue Belt marine conservation schemeNo new restrictions on fox huntingTo combat the sewage crisis blighting Britain’s waterways, the Tories would work with the regulator, Ofwat, to hold companies to account, including banning bonuses for bosses if their firm has committed a serious criminal breach. Proceeds from water companies fines would be used to invest in river restoration projects.The party would cut red tape that “holds back the planting of trees in the planning system”, identifying suitable areas where permits can be streamlined.It would maintain its “record flooding funding” of £5.6 billion over 2021-2027 and champion rural communities by backing farmers with a new legal target for food security.And it would “always stand up for farmers when negotiating new trade deals”.MrSunak said his party would back farmers with a new legal target for food security - Aaron Chown/PAThe Conservatives would boost the availability of affordable housing for local people in rural areas, while ensuring councils have the powers they need to manage “the uncontrolled growth of holiday lets”.Mr Sunak has also vowed not to introduce any new restrictions on fox hunting after Labour said it would ban all forms of hunting with hounds if he wins.Read the full 2024 Labour manifesto hereHe promised not to make any changes to the Hunting Act introduced by Sir Tony Blair in 2004, in a pitch to traditional Tory heartlands.The Tories would consult UK overseas territories on further expanding the Blue Belt programme, the UK’s flagship marine conservation scheme.And the party remains committed to banning the import of hunting trophies and tackling puppy smuggling and livestock worrying.Energy and net zeroCut consumers’ costs by taking a “more pragmatic approach” to the transitionLower green levies on household billsPut forward a vote in Parliament for any new net zero targetNo new green levies or frequent flyer chargeNorth Sea licensing rounds to continue annuallyTreble Britain’s offshore wind capacity and support solar energy “in the right places”The Tories’ central pledge on net zero is to cut the cost for consumers by taking a “more pragmatic approach” to the transition, with green levies on household bills lower in each year of the next Parliament than they were in 2023.The “next stage” of the roadmap would be put to a vote in Parliament, with any new target subject to “proper consideration of the plans and policies required”, in order to “maintain democratic consent for the big decisions that net zero will mean for our country”.The party would reform the Climate Change Committee, giving it an “explicit mandate to consider cost to households and UK energy security” in its future advice.It also ruled out creating any new green levies or a frequent flyer charge.North Sea licensing rounds would continue on an annual basis, in contrast to Labour’s policy. Meanwhile, the Tories would aim to treble Britain’s offshore wind capacity and support solar “in the right places” - crucially “not on our best agricultural land”.It also pledges to look at burying pylons underground and guaranteeing a parliamentary vote on the next stages of the “pathway” of net zero.Education and childcareBan mobile phones during the school dayEnsure parents see what their children are being taught in schoolsTransform post-16 education with new “Advanced British Standard”Create 100,000 apprenticeships by 2029New teachers in priority areas to get bonuses of up to £30k tax-free over five yearsThe Tories would ban mobile phones during the school day and ensure parents can see what their children are being taught, especially on “sensitive matters like sex education”.The party would aim to “transform” post-16 education by introducing a new Advanced British Standard, bringing together academic A-levels and technical T-levels.It has also pledged to create a further 100,000 apprenticeships by 2029, paid for by scrapping “poor quality” degrees.Both primary and secondary schools would be required to deliver two hours of PE every week. To boost recruitment, new teachers in priority areas and sought-after subjects would receive bonuses of up to £30,000 tax-free over five years from September 2024.The Prime Minister’s flagship campaign promise to bring back national service also features in the manifesto.Under the mandatory scheme, 18-year-olds would have to enrol in the military for a year or spend one weekend each month volunteering in their community.DefenceBring back national service for school leaversIncrease military budget to 2.5 per cent of GDP by end of the decade£3 billion in support every year for Ukraine until 2030Introduce a Veterans’ Bill that gives employers tax breaks for hiring themIn his first major policy announcement of the election campaign, Mr Sunak vowed to bring back national service for school leavers, which would open military placements to 30,000 youngsters with residential stays at army barracks or other military facilities.The Conservatives hope the policy will set them apart from Labour as they seek to present themselves as the only party that can be trusted with the UK’s security and defence with multiple threats facing Britain and the world.Mr Sunak warned in a speech in May that a Labour victory represented a threat to UK security.The Prime Minister announced his party would hike the military budget to 2.5 per cent of GDP by the end of the decade - a commitment Labour has failed to match.He also committed to at least £3 billion in support every year for Ukraine until 2030, with both pledges reinforced in the election manifesto.In a major speech at the Policy Exchange think tank on May 13, Mr Sunak argued that Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, would be emboldened by Labour not matching his promise to raise defence spending to 2.5 per cent by 2030.It comes with concerns having been raised about the size of the Army, Navy and Air Force and their struggle to attract enough new recruits.In a tribute to Armed Forces personnel, Mr Sunak will also introduce a Veterans’ Bill to give employers tax breaks for hiring “heroes who have put their lives on the line” and cut the price of rail travel for them.Elsewhere, the Tories pledged to declare China a risk to UK security on a par with Russia and Iran if they win the election.They have committed to adding China to the “enhanced tier” of the UK’s foreign influence registration scheme, meaning all Chinese individuals acting on behalf of the nation would face heightened scrutiny.Pensions and welfare“Quadruple lock” state pension that will never be taxedKeep winter fuel payments, free TV licences and bus passes for pensionersCrackdown on Britain’s welfare billOverhaul sick notes to get more people back into workTougher sanctions for those able to seek work but choose not toMr Sunak declared on May 27 that the state pension will never be taxed under the Conservatives as he unveiled a so-called quadruple lock.The manifesto also promises to keep all other pensioner perks including winter fuel payments, free TV licences and bus passes in place.It adds: “We are carefully considering the Ombudsman report into WASPI women and will work with Parliament to provide an appropriate and swift response.”At the same time it takes a completely different approach when it comes to benefits, with a crackdown on Britain’s ballooning welfare bill set out.The manifesto includes an overhaul of sick notes to get more people back into work and tougher sanctions for those who are able to seek work but choose not to.Policing and crimeTougher sentencing for knife crimeBuild four new jails by 2030, providing 20,000 extra prison placesRecruit an extra 8,000 police officersNew mandatory 25-year sentences for domestic abuse murdersNew police powers to ban protests that pose a risk of serious disorderBan protests outside schoolsThe election campaign will see Mr Sunak and Sir Keir battle it out for who can sound the toughest when it comes to cracking down on crime.Labour has banged the drum on lower-level offences like burglary and antisocial behaviour, painting a picture of a lawless Britain where neighbourhoods live in fear.The Prime Minister has come under pressure to match that rhetoric with harsher sentences for petty criminals and more community payback schemes.His manifesto includes a crackdown on knife crime with tougher sentencing, allowing the Tories to target Sadiq Khan’s record in London.The Tories also pledge to build four new jails by 2030, providing 20,000 extra prison places so that more criminals can be locked up for longer.The dossier also includes a commitment to recruit an extra 8,000 police officers dedicated specifically to tackling neighbourhood crime in a £650 million plan that would take the total number of officers in the UK to its highest level ever at 180,000.And it states that the Tories will “toughen up community sentencing by increasing the use of community payback and electronic tagging, so criminals pay their debt to society and communities witness justice being served”.Elsewhere it contains new mandatory 25-year sentences for domestic abuse murders and commits to a wider review of homicide sentencing which could lead to the creation of US-style first and second-degree murder, increasing the minimum sentence for murders in the home from 15 to 25 years.Find out how Reform UK’s full manifesto comparesThe manifesto also says police will get new powers to ban protests or marches that pose a risk of serious disorder. Chief constables would be able to block marches due to the “cumulative” disruption and “persistent” threats to public order. Police could also be able to recover the costs of policing protests from groups that organised them.Protests outside schools would also be banned to “stop mobs from intimidating teachers and children”. Teachers would be given legal protection from blasphemy accusations following cases such as the Batley school cartoon row where a teacher was forced into hiding.Police and prosecutors would be placed under a new legal duty to publish regular guidance on the statements, chants or symbols, such as the swastika or the term “jihad”, that in the context of political protest may constitute an offence.MigrationBring in a “binding, legal” annual cap on immigrationAnnual vote in Parliament on the visa cap figureLegal migrants must undergo a health check before getting a visaRaise skilled workers’ salary requirements in line with inflation each yearRemove illegal migrants to Rwanda, with monthly flights, starting in July, until the boats are stoppedSign further returns deals similar to the agreement with AlbaniaMr Sunak has been under huge pressure from his own MPs to go into the next election on a cast-iron promise to dramatically cut net migration.The manifesto includes a commitment to bring in a “binding, legal” annual cap on immigration visas but does not say at what number it would be set.Instead Parliament would get an annual vote on the visa cap figure, which would be recommended by the Government’s migration advisers.Legal migrants would be required to undergo a health check before getting a visa as part of a plan to reduce the cost to the NHS of those arriving with conditions.The manifesto also includes a commitment to raise the salary requirements for skilled workers in line with inflation every year “to make sure they don’t undercut UK workers”.On stopping the small boats, it says: “We will run a relentless, continual process of permanently removing illegal migrants to Rwanda with a regular rhythm of flights every month, starting this July, until the boats are stopped.”The manifesto also commits the Government to “sign further returns deals like the one we have already agreed with Albania”.It also says the party will work with other countries to “rewrite” asylum treaties to make them fit for the “challenges” of illegal migration.But it stops short of pledging a referendum on leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, as demanded by some Tory MPs.Instead it only opens the door to the possibility of leaving the convention by vowing to put the security of UK borders ahead of membership of a foreign court.Levelling-upGive 30 towns across UK £20 million eachCreate more freeports and continue backing investment zonesRevitalise high streets by changing planning lawsMake chewing gum manufacturers pay for street cleaningMr Sunak has pledged to give 30 towns across the UK £20 million each in an expansion of the party’s levelling-up policy.The Prime Minister claimed the methodology used to select the towns – including Tamworth, Bognor Regis, Flint, Perth and Newry – had been used “multiple times before” based on “levelling-up needs, looking at economic opportunity, skills, health and life expectancy”.He claimed towns were “neglected” under a previous Labour government and added: “I’m not going to make any apology for supporting towns.“Crucially, it will be local people in all those areas that are in charge of how to spend that money, to make sure it’s spent and invested on their priorities - an example of us levelling up everywhere, backing local people and their priorities, and giving them the long-term funding and assurance to do so,” he said.The manifesto also includes pledges to create more freeports, where businesses get tax breaks for investing, and to continue backing investment zones.Elsewhere it features a commitment to revitalise high streets by changing planning laws and making chewing gum manufacturers pay for street cleaning.“We will change planning laws to support places to bring back local market days and regenerate defunct shopping centres,” it says.",Conservative Party manifesto 2024: Rishi Sunak’s policies for the general election,20,11

124,"Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally (RN) has taken a strong lead in France’s first round of parliamentary elections, following an unusually high turnout among voters. Official results showed that the nationalist leader’s party won 33 per cent of the vote, while current president Emmanuel Macron’s Together coalition slumped to third place on 20 per cent. Leftwing party New Popular Front (NFP) scored around 28 per cent.Speaking at an election party in the northern town of Henin Beaumont, Ms Le Pen said: “Democracy has spoken, and the French people have placed the National Rally and its allies in first place – and has practically wiped out the Macronist bloc. Nothing has been won – and the second round will be decisive.”Le Pen is at the ‘gates of power’ following first round success (AP)The elections were called just three weeks ago after Mr Macron’s party suffered heavy defeats in the European parliament election earlier in June by the National Rally, which has historic ties to racism and antisemitism and is hostile toward France’s Muslim community.Mr Macron, in a written statement, called for a “broad” democratic alliance against the far-right and said that the high voter turnout spoke of “the importance of this vote for all our compatriots and the desire to clarify the political situation”.His party said their candidates would drop out in areas where they had come third place in favour of contenders “in a position to beat the RN and with whome we share the essential: the values of the republic”.Jean Luc-Melenchon, leader of the far-left party La France Insoumise (LFI), a part of the NFP, called for all leftwing candidates tipped to come third to do the same and bow out of the race.Meanwhile, Ms Le Pen said that an “absolute majority” at parliament would enable the far right to form a new government with party president Jordan Bardella as prime minister in order prioritise France’s “recovery”.Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte cast their votes on Sunday (Getty)Projections by polling agencies suggest the National Rally stands a good chance of winning a majority in the lower house of parliament for the first time, with an estimated one-third of the first-round vote, nearly double their 18 per cent in the first round in 2022.Their success now leaves open huge questions on how Mr Macron will share power with a prime minister who is hostile to most of his policies.The two-round elections that wrap up on 7 July could impact European financial markets, Western support for Ukraine and the management of France’s nuclear arsenal and global military force.However, many French voters are frustrated about inflation and other economic concerns, as well as Mr Macron’s leadership, seen as arrogant and out-of-touch.Ms Le Pen‘s anti-immigration National Rally party has tapped that discontent, notably via online platforms like TikTok, and led in pre-election opinion polls.The far-right leader said her party had ‘practically wiped out’ Macron’s centrist coalition (Reuters)A new coalition on the left, the New Popular Front, also poses a challenge to the pro-business Mr Macron and his centrist alliance Together for the Republic.His election call was a gamble that French voters who were complacent about the European election would be jolted into turning out for moderate forces in national elections to keep the far right out of power. Instead, pre-election polls suggested the National Rally had a chance at winning a parliamentary majority.In that scenario, Mr Macron would be expected to name 28-year-old Mr Bardella as prime minister in an awkward power-sharing system known as “cohabitation”.It would then be his job to manage foreign policy and act as chief of the armed forces while Mr Bardella would run domestic affairs and set the budget.While Mr Macron has said he will not step down before his presidential term expires in 2027, cohabitation would weaken him at home and on the world stage.",Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party take the lead in first round of French election voting,20,9

Independent predictions say under Labour the tax burden is the highest it has ever been.“Under the Conservatives we have already started bringing taxes down, we’ve committed to abolishing National Insurance.

alongside many decent, honest and hardworking people during the course of the General Election campaign in Erewash, the reports of widespread racism and sexism in Reform have made clear that there is a significant moral issue within certain elements of the party, and the failure of the party’s leadership to not only take this matter seriously, but also to fundamentally address it, has made clear to me that this is no longer a party I want to be associated with.”“As a result, I am announcing my endorsement of the Conservative Party candidate, Maggie Throup, for Erewash.

I was told they were a broad church. Well they’re a broad church without any religion.“It simply doesn’t work. So we will again renew our campaign with added vigour to say that the state broadcaster has abused its position of power and we will campaign for the abolition of the BBC licence fee.”Farage claims Reform canvasser comments were ‘smear campaign’ effortsSunday 30 June 2024 14:09 , Maryam Zakir-HussainNigel Farage claimed the comments made by a Reform UK canvasser were part of a “smear campaign” against the party as he said the “bad apples are gone” and “we’ll never have them back”.The party leader said Andrew Parker’s remarks had been “used as the biggest smear against us”.He told the rally: “Look, Reform is a new organisation. It’s a start-up and there were requests put out for candidates to stand.“Have we had a few bad apples? We have, although to my knowledge nobody involved in an organised betting ring is standing for us, which is something.”He added: “I have to say, the bad apples are gone.

But Giles Watling, the Tory MP defending his Clacton seat, may be the only Conservative candidate in this election with a wide coalition of support across the country willing him to win.In the wake of the Channel 4 News expose of the Reform Clacton team and the racist comments by one of the canvassers Andrew Parker, Watling received a telephone call from Tony Blair’s former spin doctor Alastair Campbell, in normal circumstances no lover of Tories.Bad actors or conspiracy theories - the inside story of Farage’s battle for ClactonClaims about Russian interference in General Election ‘cobblers’, says FarageSunday 30 June 2024 12:50 , Maryam Zakir-HussainClaims that Russian-inspired bots might be posting on social media to interfere with the General Election are “cobblers”, Reform UK’s leader has said.Nigel Farage made his remarks after the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) named five Facebook pages which the broadcaster claimed were linked, had shared pro-Russian Kremlin narratives, and in some cases had supported Reform UK.Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden described the ABC’s findings as “gravely concerning”.Asked about the automated technology on Sky News’s Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, Mr Farage responded: “Oh, don’t talk cobblers.”He added: “I mean you had this, this, this bland fellow on earlier who apparently is the Deputy Prime Minister, who no-one knows who he is, and there he is saying, ‘oh, there are Russian bots involved’.“Hang on, did you ask him how many millions of pounds his party have taken from Russian sources over the course of the last few years?“This is the Russia hoax.” (Peter Byrne/PA Wire)Reform rally underway in BirminghamSunday 30 June 2024 12:32 , Maryam Zakir-HussainAddressing a Reform UK rally at Birmingham’s National Exhibition Centre, former Brexit Party MEP Ann Widdecombe said Nigel Farage’s party would “bring common sense back to Britain” and “get rid of woke”.She told thousands of Reform supporters: “We stand for two words above all - common sense.”After accusing the Tories of putting all their “eggs in the Rwanda basket” without a plan B, Ms Widdecombe said there was no reason why Reform UK should not form the official opposition following Thursday’s poll.“These next four days are crucial,” she said, adding that she had “heard more common sense” in the last five years than in her previous 55 years in the Conservative Party.Nigel Farage claims Reform UK activist who directed racist comments at Rishi Sunak is ‘an actor’Sunday 30 June 2024 11:48 , Maryam Zakir-HussainNigel Farage claimed a Reform UK canvasser who called for English Channel migrants to be used as “target practice” was an actor.Farage claims Reform UK activist who directed racist comments at Sunak is ‘an actor’PM says there’s a ‘clear difference’ between Frank Hester and Nigel Farage racism rowsSunday 30 June 2024 11:30 , Maryam Zakir-HussainRishi Sunak said there is a “clear difference” between his handling of the racism row surrounding Tory donor Frank Hester and how Nigel Farage has responded to racist comments made about the Prime Minister by a Reform UK canvasser.Appearing on the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme, the Prime Minister was shown a message from a viewer who condemned the campaigner’s language but expressed concern that Mr Sunak’s stance on racism had not been zero-tolerance.The viewer pointed to Mr Hester, from whom the Tories continued to accept donations, having allegedly said Diane Abbott “should be shot” and made him “want to hate all black women”.Mr Sunak said: “I think it’s reasonable when someone is genuinely contrite about what’s happened, accepts what they’ve done is wrong, then that apology is accepted.”He added: “The difference here is... Nigel Farage has just described these comments as ‘inappropriate’.“They’re not inappropriate. They were vile and racist and wrong, but he’s only said that they’re inappropriate.“The person who made them has only apologised to the Reform Party for the impact it’s had on them. It’s a very clear difference. There’s no contrition or remorse or acceptance of what’s happened in that case.”Watch: Sunak clashes with BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg over Brexit: ‘You’re completely wrong’Sunday 30 June 2024 11:05 , Maryam Zakir-HussainRishi Sunak says he is proud of disastrous election campaign - and claims he will winSunday 30 June 2024 10:45 , Maryam Zakir-HussainRishi Sunak has said he is “proud” of his disastrous election campaign - and claimed he would win Thursday’s general election.The prime minister has come under fire in recent weeks for a series of calamities that included a rain-soaked announcement of polling day, leaving D-Day commemorations early and a gambling scandal.But in a crunch interview with just days to go before the vote, Mr Sunak told the BBC‘s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg show “this campaign is something I am very proud of” as he sought to highlight Labour’s plans.Kate Devlin reports:Rishi Sunak says he is proud of disastrous election campaign - and claims he will winPM says Reform canvasser’s racial slur was ‘deeply inappropriate and racist'Sunday 30 June 2024 10:27 , Maryam Zakir-HussainRishi Sunak said the slur used about him by a Reform UK canvasser was “deeply inappropriate and racist”.The Prime Minister told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg show that anyone becoming a politician expects a degree of criticism because it “comes with the territory”.But he went on: “But in this instance, you know, what was said was deeply inappropriate and racist.”Mr Sunak said he hated having to repeat the phrase used about him but thought it was important to call it out.He said that Britain is “the most successful multi-faith, multi-ethnic democracy anywhere in the world”, adding: “That’s why views like this are so damaging and so wrong.“They belong to a minority of people and they deserve to be called out for what they are, and that’s what I did.”Sunday 30 June 2024 10:18 , Maryam Zakir-HussainRishi Sunak hit back at what he claimed was a “declinist narrative” when asked whether it was a mistake to change course on net zero.BBC presenter Laura Kuenssberg pointed out that some people, including the independent Climate Change Committee, believe that the UK has lost its status as a leader on the issue.The broadcaster said there was “plenty of evidence” that the economic reality of Brexit is that Britain’s standing long-term is “more challenging”.Asked whether he thought the shift was a mistake, the Prime Minister appeared frustrated as he said: “No, and actually you started that question with something that I fundamentally disagree with: ‘because of Brexit, we’ve lost our standing in the world’.”Told that was not what the she had said, he replied: “You said we’ve lost our standing in the world. That’s completely and utterly wrong.”Mr Sunak cited Britain building new nuclear submarines with Australia and the United States, and the negotiation of the Windsor Framework with the EU and support for Ukraine.He claimed that “people are queuing up to work with us because they respect what we do”.“So I just completely reject that, it’s entirely wrong, this kind of declinist narrative that people have of the UK I wholeheartedly reject.”PM confronted by viewers’ questionsSunday 30 June 2024 10:08 , Maryam Zakir-HussainRishi Sunak was told viewers want to “stick to the policies of the person who is sitting in the chair” after he accused Labour of planning to reaccept EU laws when asked about Brexit.During questions on trade negotiations since leaving the European Union, he told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme: “You haven’t mentioned we’re the first European nation to join the CPTPP trade deal.“We were negotiating very closely with India and I’m confident that we will be the first European country, again under a Conservative government if we’re re-elected, to negotiate the trade deal that steep with India, which again is one of the fastest growing parts of the world... I don’t think it’s right for Labour to end up re-accepting EU rules that we have no say over.”Ms Kuenssberg said: “I’ll remind you, as I have every politician in the last six weeks, that our viewers want us to stick to the party’s policies of the person who is sitting in the chair, with respect.”Rishi Sunak says he is 'proud' of his election campaignSunday 30 June 2024 09:58 , Maryam Zakir-HussainRishi Sunak has said he is ‘proud’ of his election campaign.“This campaign is something I am very proud of,” he told the BBC.It comes after he left D-Day commemorations early and his party became embroiled in a gambling scandal.PM: ‘Investing in defence shows we have strength’Sunday 30 June 2024 09:51 , Maryam Zakir-HussainRishi Sunak said investing in defence shows the UK’s adversaries that “we have strength” as he added “the world is dangerous”.When challenged about his plan to cut civil servants to fund this increase in spending, he said: “We’ve had a massive expansion of civil servants since the pandemic to deal with it, it was reasonable at the time, but it’s no longer reasonable.”Sunak: ‘UK is better place to live now than when Tories first came into office’Sunday 30 June 2024 09:42 , Maryam Zakir-HussainRishi Sunak said the UK is a better place to live in now than it was when the Tories took office in 2010.The Prime Minister told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg: “It’s a better place to live than it was in 2010.“Of course I understand that the last few years have been difficult for everyone.He cited the pandemic and the war in Ukraine driving up energy bills, insisting “we are now on the right track”.It was put to him that the country has become poorer by many measures since 2010, and public services are worse.“I just don’t accept that,” Mr Sunak replied, citing education and saying “our schoolchildren are now the best readers in the western world”.",General election latest: Farage says Tories ‘screwed’ regardless of Reform as party warns against far right,20,9
8,"A Reform UK candidate has criticised a “failure of leadership” amid allegations of racism within the party as he stepped down and backed the Conservatives in another blow to Nigel Farage’s campaign.Liam Booth-Isherwood, who was standing in the seat of Erewash, announced he was dropping out of the race and would instead be endorsing Tory contender Maggie Throup to “stop Labour”.The candidate said he had become “increasingly disillusioned” with the behaviour of the party, which he suggested pointed to a “significant moral issue” within its ranks.Because nominations for the July 4 poll have closed, Mr Booth-Isherwood will still appear on the ballot paper.But he has urged voters in the Derbyshire constituency to support the Conservative candidate Ms Throup, who has represented Erewash since 2015.Mr Booth-Isherwood said in a statement: “I am today announcing my decision to leave the Reform Party and have suspended my campaign as the Reform candidate for Erewash with immediate effect.“Over the past few weeks, I have been increasingly disillusioned with the behaviour and conduct of Reform.“Whilst I have campaigned alongside many decent, honest and hardworking people during the course of the General Election campaign in Erewash, the reports of widespread racism and sexism in Reform have made clear that there is a significant moral issue within certain elements of the party, and the failure of the party’s leadership to not only take this matter seriously, but also to fundamentally address it, has made clear to me that this is no longer a party I want to be associated with.“As a result, I am announcing my endorsement of the Conservative Party candidate, Maggie Throup, for Erewash. Only she can stop Labour.”Party chairman Richard Tice claimed the switch in support suggested that Conservatives were offering jobs and inducements to Reform candidates “to persuade them to talk badly of Reform, stand down and then endorse the Tory candidate”.“This shows dark forces at play by desperate Tories,” he wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter.It comes after Mr Farage faced accusations from across the political divide of failing to tackle allegations of racism within Reform which have engulfed the party in recent days.Addressing a rally in Birmingham earlier on Sunday, the party leader insisted that “the bad apples are gone” after withdrawing support for three candidates over the row.Nigel Farage has faced accusations from across the political divide of failing to tackle allegations of racism within Reform (Matthew Cooper/PA)Campaigners for Reform in the Clacton seat Mr Farage hopes to win in Essex were also recorded by an undercover journalist from Channel 4 making racist comments, including about the Prime Minister, who is of Indian descent.Another activist described the Pride flag as “degenerate” and suggested members of the LGBT community are paedophiles.Mr Farage has suggested that the Channel 4 footage is a “set-up” – a claim the broadcaster strenuously denies.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was hurt and angered by the racist term used about him (Joe Giddens/PA)Meanwhile, Reform has confirmed it has dropped support for candidates Leslie Lilley in Southend East and Rochford; Edward Oakenfull in Derbyshire Dales; and Robert Lomas in Barnsley North.They will also appear on the ballot paper but have lost party backing.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he shared Mr Sunak’s “disgust” at the use of the slur, which the Prime Minister has condemned as “vile” and “racist”.Channel 4 hit back at the suggestion it had paid Mr Parker to be in the footage, with a spokesperson for the broadcaster saying: “We met Mr Parker for the first time at Reform UK party headquarters, where he was a Reform party canvasser.”The Tories said that if 130,000 voters joined the Reform UK candidate who switched to back the Conservatives “it would be enough to stop Labour’s supermajority”.“Mr Booth-Isherwood knows a vote for Reform is a vote for Keir Starmer,” a party spokesman said.“There is no doubt, only a vote for the Conservatives can prevent an unaccountable majority for Labour, and the ruin this would bring for the country.”A Labour spokesperson said: “This is further proof that the only way to get the change we need is to vote Labour on July 4.“After 14 years of Tory chaos, Labour is the only party with a plan for economic security, secure borders, the NHS back on its feet, cheaper bills, safer streets and better opportunities for our children.”Ms Throup said she was “delighted” that Mr Booth-Isherwood was backing her campaign, saying in a post on X: “He has taken the brave step to make a stand agaist some of the serious issues we have seen within certain elements of the Reform Party, and I commend him for this.”",Reform UK candidate drops out and backs Tories amid racism row,19,4
328,"The electoral asteroid is nearly upon us: Rishi Sunak presides over a government rejected by record numbers of voters in the polls. The Conservatives go into election day having lost more than half of their support, and polling more than 10 points below their worst ever previous result. No wonder that polls project a record swing to Labour, larger, by far, than in any previous postwar election.Some projections have the Tories falling below 100 seats – an extinction-level event for Britain’s oldest and most electorally successful party. Thursday looks set to be a night of historic political drama: here are the key things to look out for as the night goes on.Interactive1 The exit poll and the early running: were the polls right? Is the exit poll right?The show begins at 10pm, when the polls close and the exit poll is published. This will give us a first sense of the scale of what is to come. If late swing or polling error is going to deliver a surprise, the exit poll is when we will first see it.Discussion of exit poll projections will dominate the early hours as politicians and pundits await the first results, and some will be sure to cast doubt as to accuracy. Ignore them. While no method is perfect, the exit poll has an excellent recent track record and can be trusted to chart the broad contours of the night to come.InteractiveThe next big moments will come about midnight, when the first seats declare. The very first is likely to be in Sunderland, which has made fast counts a speciality in recent contests. The key things to watch for is how the swing and result compare to exit poll projections, and how Reform UK is doing. Cramlington and Killingworth, another early reporting north-east seat, is worth watching, as its predecessor, Blyth Valley, was the first “red wall” seat taken by the Tories in 2019, and will be the first brick in a rebuilt red wall for Labour this time.With polling suggesting weaker swings to Labour in the seats it already holds, the best early indicators will come from the trio of early-declaring Conservative seats. Swindon South is a classic swing seat, which Labour should take easily. Two others, Broxbourne, and Basildon and Billericay, provide sterner tests – each requires a swing of more than 20 points to take, substantially above the current polling averages. Losing either or both of these seats will be a ­bitter early blow for Conservatives and may be an early sign of a Labour landslide to come.2 Red wall restoration? Will Labour recover seats lost to the Conservatives since 2015?The fall of the red wall was a ­bitter blow for Labour in 2019, as seat after seat turned against the party they had backed for generations. Recovering the lost heartlands is not just a matter of sentiment – Labour cannot win a majority without a rebuilt red wall.The early-to-declare red-wall seats are all near-certain to be Labour gains. But watch to see how high the majorities go when Leigh and Atherton, and then Darlington, declare earlier – this will give some hint about the scale of Labour’s recovery.Recovering Bolsover, the seat for nearly 50 years of leftwing firebrand Dennis Skinner, will be a particular morale boost for Labour leftwingers. But it will be victories in Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes, and in Scunthorpe, that will suggest Labour is on course to fully sweep the red wall, as these are seats where the Conservatives have larger notional majorities to defend. A win later in Bassetlaw would be the icing on the cake, meaning Labour had recovered the seat that saw the largest swing against them in 2019.The conclusion of the red wall story will come in Spen Valley after dawn. A win for Labour candidate Kim Leadbeater here will bring Keir Starmer’s recovery story full circle. It was Leadbeater’s narrow victory in the Batley and Spen byelection that steadied the Starmer ship in summer 2021, after a bruising set of local and byelection defeats had called his leadership into question. Now a second victory for Leadbeater in Spen Valley could help to complete the leader’s remarkable Labour comeback.3 Tartan tides: Will Scotland fall to Labour too?One of the underdiscussed subplots of this election is the huge SNP-to-Labour swing in Scottish polling. This is as large as the swing south of the border and, with the SNP vote evenly spread, dozens of SNP seats are now on a knife-edge. Hamilton and Clyde Valley, which should declare before 2am, provides the first real test. Labour needs an eight-point swing and could be in for a disappointing night in Scotland if they fall short. A Labour win in East Kilbride and Strathaven, where they need a 13-point swing, will suggest big gains to come, while a win in Dundee Central, reporting after 2am, would suggest a Scottish earthquake is coming – this is the SNP’s safest seat.InteractiveTwo Scottish subplots will develop later on. The first is the fate of seats contested between the Conservatives and the SNP. With both parties declining, but their opponents often weak and fragmented, these are hard seats to call. Some may end up as three-way or even four-way marginals, and surprise wins from third or even fourth place can’t be ruled out. The Lib Dems provide the other Scottish subplot. They are only in direct contention in a handful of Scottish seats, but have deep roots in parts of Scotland and would also dearly like to avenge the 2019 defeat of Jo Swinson by recovering Mid Dunbartonshire, the successor to the former leader’s East Dunbartonshire seat.4 Will the blue wall fall to the Lib Dems?This election is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the Liberal Democrats. Political geography, long their worst enemy, is finally working in their favour, as they start in second place to a flailing government in dozens of seats. They stand also to benefit from a helpful Labour party with an unthreatening leader, which should make it easier to maximise tactical voting and to win over Tory moderates voters spooked by Corbyn but now reassured by Starmer.InteractiveThe first signs of Lib Dem ­progress will come about 2am, when two seats at opposite ends of England, Harrogate and Knaresborough, and Torbay, report. Both had Lib Dem MPs during the New Labour years, and the Lib Dems will hope to recover both this week. Torbay – Brexity and bluer – is the tougher task.We will learn if we are in for a more dramatic Lib Dem breakthrough after about 3am, when seats such as Stratford-on-Avon, Epsom and Ewell, and Witney report their results. These heartland seats have all reliably returned Tory MPs for a century or more – and all require big swings. Victory for the Lib Dems in David Cameron’s former seat of Witney would be a potent symbol of a possible revolt by home counties Tory stalwarts against the populist, Brexit-flavoured Conservatism of Cameron’s successors.5 The Farage effect: where could Reform win outright and where will they tip the balance against the Tories?The return of Nigel Farage has upended this campaign, with a Reform UK bounce further damaging grim Tory prospects. Yet Reform’s support is too evenly spread, and the party’s organisation too weak, for Farage to gain many seats outright. Reform’s biggest impact will instead come through tipping the balance against the Conservatives in hundreds of seats.We can see this by looking at how many seats Labour alone gains at different levels of swing and different levels of Conservative-to-Reform switching. At each level of swing, Labour can make 100 or more extra seat gains if we move from a low to high rate of Conservative-to-Reform switching.InteractiveThe scale of the defeat will depend heavily on the share of Conservative voters who end up in the Reform column. Castle Point will give an early indication – the Conservatives start with a huge majority here, but Ukip topped 30% in this heavily leave-voting seat. If either Reform or Labour wins here, it will ­suggest a Reform surge and a Tory slump are coming in heavily leave-voting areas. Mansfield, Norfolk North and Great Yarmouth will provide three tests of the Reform effect. Strong Reform performances could help Labour win Mansfield and the Lib Dems win Norfolk North, and turn Great Yarmouth into a three-way marginal.Reform won’t win many seats but could win a few. Clacton is the likeliest gain, with polling suggesting Nigel Farage will finally win a Commons seat at the eighth attempt. Boston and Skegness, where Farage’s predecessor, Richard Tice, is standing, is another prospect, as is Ashfield, where Tory-to-Reform defector Lee Anderson faces a chaotic local dogfight with Labour and the popular independent council leader Jason Zadrozny. It is also worth watching how Reform do in Barnsley – the only place where the Brexit party came second in 2019.6 Red and blue breakthroughs for the Greens?While Reform will be the smaller party making the biggest waves in this contest, advances for the Greens could be a sign of disruptions to come. The Greens are targeting four seats. They are looking to hold off a Labour challenge in Brighton Pavilion, where the first Green MP, Caroline Lucas, is standing down, and defeat Labour in Bristol Central, where Green co-leader Carla Denyer is running against Labour shadow cabinet minister Thangam Debbonaire. The Greens are also targeting two deep-blue rural seats – Waveney Valley and North Herefordshire. Both constituency polls and MRP models suggest they are in with a strong chance in all four contests.The Greens will also hope to build a platform for future success with strong second places in other seats where local support is strong. Keep an eye on results in the Isle of Wight, Sheffield and in central London and Manchester seats. None are likely to fall to the Greens, but second-place finishes could set them up as contenders in contests to come.7 Trouble in Labour’s backyard?Keir Starmer faces some tricky defences in Labour’s backyard, particularly in seats with large Muslim electorates or high-profile independents. George Galloway mobilised unrest over the Gaza conflict among Muslim voters to take Rochdale from Labour in a byelection earlier this spring. Labour will dearly hope to retake the seat from Galloway in the rematch. Labour is also fighting off challenges from Galloway’s Workers Party of Britain and Galloway-aligned independents in seats with large Muslim communities such as Birmingham Ladywood, where Akhmed Yakoob hopes to unseat Labour shadow cabinet minister Shabana Mahmood.Then there is the messy contest in Leicester East, the seat with the largest Hindu electorate in Britain. Two former Labour MPs, Keith Vaz and Claudia Webbe, are standing against their former party, while Labour also faces a threat from resurgent local Conservatives, who made major gains in Leicester in 2023 local elections. This seat, along with two outer London seats – Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner and Harrow East – are worth watching to see if Rishi Sunak’s rise as the first ever Hindu prime minister has accelerated a long-term drift towards the Conservatives among Hindu voters.Finally, in Islington North, Labour faces a unique challenge, when Keir Starmer’s predecessor as Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, challenges his former party in the seat he represented for more than 40 years, mostly as a Labour MP.8 Return of New Labour? Seats Blair won in 1997 that Starmer could win backTo what extent will Starmer’s win be a restoration of the 1997 Blair ascendancy? There are 199 seats which Blair would have won on current boundaries in 1997 and which Labour does not currently hold. If polling proves accurate, Starmer could regain 150 or more of these lost New Labour seats.InteractiveThe first big test of Starmer’s recovery in middle England will come when Swindon North reports before 2am. The seat backed Blair three times and has swung heavily to the Tories since. Labour needs a 14-point swing to recover it.Cannock Chase provides an even bigger test. This Staffordshire seat has proved to be one of the swingiest in the country, going from a 55% Labour vote in 1997 to a near 70% Conservative vote in 2019. If Labour wins here, it will suggest Keir Starmer has won back the hearts of middle England – or is at least benefiting from a total Tory rejection in Blair’s old heartlands.Keep an eye out later in the night for results from classic suburban and small town bellwethers such as Crawley, Romford, Dudley and Nuneaton. Blair won them all and if Starmer is going on to match his predecessor, so should he. Tamworth, which Labour lost after Blair and won back on a huge swing in a recent byelection, is another seat to watch.9 Bigger than Blair? Seats Starmer could win which never backed New LabourWith Keir Starmer projected to achieve the largest swing in postwar history, Labour can set their sights higher than even the landslide victory of 1997, targeting seats which Blair never won but which demographic change, and exceptional polling, make winnable next week.The first signs that Starmer may be advancing into uncharted territory will come between 2am and 3am, when North West Cambridgeshire and Aldershot declare. Neither has ever elected a Labour MP, and both require very large swings, but most MRP models now favour the opposition in both. Labour could also take the once true-blue seats of Blair-era Tory big beasts, including Ken Clarke’s Rushcliffe and John Major’s Huntingdon.InteractiveIf Labour also manages to hold Mid Bedfordshire, which they took on a massive swing in a byelection, and gain places such as Isle of Wight West or Bexhill and Battle, which have never returned Labour MPs before, then we will probably be on course for a “bigger than Blair” majority as the Conservative retreat turns into a rout.10 ‘A new dawn has ­broken, has it not?’ How low could the Tories go?The broad outlines of the electoral landscape will be clear well before dawn. While the scale and scope of a probable Labour victory settled, two questions will remain: how many Conservatives will survive? And who will be the “big beasts” of the outgoing government whose defeat will provide the “Portillo moments” of this election night?If the swings in this election become very large, the fate of many Conservative MPs may turn on the ability of voters in very safe Tory seats to coalesce behind a single opponent in seats where the tactical voting signals are not clear.A total Tory wipeout becomes plausible if Liberal Democrats can perform as well as Labour at very high levels of overall swing. But if – as is perhaps more likely – tactical voting rates are weaker in very safe Tory seats with split opposition, then dozens of Conservatives may survive even if their party’s national vote collapses.InteractivePortillo moments won’t be hard to find next week. With a historically unprecedented swing expected, the list of high-profile MPs at risk is long. Defeat looks all but certain for former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith and self-styled Brexit hardman Steve Baker, while losses for serial cabinet minister and leadership hopeful Grant Shapps or chancellor Jeremy Hunt will not come as a surprise – most pollsters project them to lose.The true Portillo moment combines shock and gravity – a big beast felled unexpectedly in a seat thought to be safe, sending shockwaves through the party ranks. The loss of Hunt, a serving chancellor, would be a bitter blow but not a surprising one. Losses for Robert Jenrick (Newark) or Penny Mordaunt (Portsmouth North) would be more consequential, reshaping the leadership contest to come. Defeat for polarising GB News favourites such as Jacob Rees-Mogg (North East Somerset and Hanham) and Esther McVey (Tatton) will dismay the right and delight the left.With unprecedented swings on the cards, there is even an outside chance that this election count could deliver the ultimate Portillo moment – the defeat of a current or former prime minister. Both Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have daunting majorities, but Sunak has felt vulnerable enough to send activists to his own seat, while the ever-unpopular Truss could underperform her own party if angry local voters mobilise against her. Sunak’s seat is due to report first. If he manages to survive, then it may perhaps fall to Truss to symbolise the Conservatives’ election night with the same quality that defined her premiership: spectacular and unprecedented political failure.Robert Ford is professor of political science at Manchester University and co-author of The British General Election of 2019",Ten things to watch as the UK general election results roll in,19,8
312,"The National Rally (RN) has won 33% of the popular vote in the first round of France’s snap two-round general election, according to final results, with the leftwing New Popular Front (NFP) alliance on 28% and President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist Together bloc on 21%.A national vote share, however, is extremely difficult to translate into a projected number of seats in the assemblée nationale. That’s because the final outcome will depend on the results in the constituencies. Pollsters issue seat estimates, but France’s polling watchdog does not endorse them.Here’s a guide to what comes next as voters gear up for the decisive second round of voting on 7 July, when France could decide to give control of its government to the far-right, anti-immigrant party for the first time in its history.What are the rules of the two-round system?To win one of the 577 seats in the national assembly in the first round, a candidate must get more than 50% of ballots cast, representing at least 25% of registered voters.This happens only rarely, although the 2024 election’s high turnout has seen the number of candidates who won in the first round rise sharply to 80.If no candidate in a constituency achieves that, the two highest scorers plus anyone else who collected at least 12.5% of total registered voters advance to a second round. In that round, the candidate who obtains the most votes is elected.How does it usually work?The two-round system is highly disproportionate and artificially boosts larger parties. On a turnout of 65%, for example, the 12.5% hurdle means parties would have to secure the backing of almost 20% of eligible voters to advance to the second round.In recent legislative elections, turnout has been significantly lower than that, meaning that in almost every constituency, only two candidates have gone through to the second round and the number of three- or four-way contests has been very low.In the 2012 elections, with a turnout of 57%, there were 34 so-called “triangular” runoffs. In 2017, when turnout was 49%, there was only one, and last time around in 2022 there were eight on a turnout of just 47%. The previous record was 76, in 1997.What’s different about this election?The combination of the highest turnout since the 1980s and fewer candidates – 4,011 against 6,290 in 2022 – from just three main camps (left, centre and far right) – means the second round of the 2024 ballot will feature a record number of “triangular” contests.With 67% of registered voters casting a ballot on Sunday, voters in a huge number of constituencies could, in principle, face a three-way race on 7 July - as many as 306, according to the official results, half the seats in the assembly.In theory, three- or four-way contests should work in favour of the party with the largest share of the vote in the first round – in these elections, generally RN – because the opposition vote is split. Many three-way contests, however, do not stay that way.What generally happens in “triangular” contests?Until recently, if the RN looked like winning a seat in a three-way race, the second- and third-placed parties would negotiate, at local and national level, to determine whose candidates would drop out.To be successful, however, that strategy requires both that the mainstream parties are willing to withdraw candidates, and that voters are happy to play along, with centre-left voters backing a candidate from the centre right, and vice-versa.But that “Republican front” has been steadily fraying, with voters increasingly unwilling to “hold their noses” and cast their ballots for parties whose policies do not necessarily align with their political preferences. In 2022, RN returned a record 89 deputies.So what will happen this time?As far as the parties go, senior figures in the four-party left-green NFP alliance – including the firebrand leader of the radical left France Unbowed (LFI), Jean-Luc Mélenchon – have promised that in all constituencies where RN is in first place and an NFP candidate is in third, the NFP candidate will withdraw.Macron’s camp has been far less clear about what its candidates would do in a similar position, with the president and party leaders calling both rival camps “extreme” – in the case of NFP, largely because it is dominated by LFI.The prime minister, Gabriel Attal, said on Sunday that third-placed candidates should step aside: “Not one single vote must go to the National Rally.” Some candidates from Macron’s coalition, however, may not withdraw faced with a candidate from LFI.As far as voters go, things are even more complicated. An Ipsos poll last week found 87% NFP voters willing to cast their ballot to block RN, but only 62% of Together voters. Another poll, by Odoxa, found that fewer voters (41%) were willing to block RN than to block NFP (47%) or Together (44%).In short, the situation is highly uncertain and will remain fluid until the actual candidates running in the second round become clear. With up to half the seats in the assembly potentially becoming three-way contests, the scope for an anti-RN “Republican front” is clearly there – but the extent of inter-party cooperation will be critical, as will be voters’ willingness to vote tactically.",French elections: far right wins first-round victory.

352,"Thousands of people fear they will be unable to vote in the general election with delays, human error and Brexit being blamed for missing postal ballot packs in the UK and abroad.Clarissa Killwick, a British citizen living in Italy, said she could not trust the post to get back in time.“I decided to leave nothing to chance and will be going to the UK to vote in person,” said Killwick, who runs a Brexit campaign group for UK citizens in Italy.Another said they had to courier their ballot back to the UK.Vienna-based Michael Goldrei said Hackney council in London told him his pack had been posted on 17 June but he started to panic when it had not arrived a week later. It eventually arrived on 26 June. Goldrei said he was “determined that my vote was counted” so he sent it back via DHL at a cost of €45 (£38). “But will others do that?”Peter Moore has been posting his vote from France for 14 years and blamed Brexit for this year’s delays. “Prior to Brexit, a letter between UK and France took two or three days … since Brexit, it now usually takes a week for a letter to arrive.”He is worried there will not be enough time to guarantee the delivery of his vote.Bruce Darrington, who is the chair of the British Overseas Voters Forum and lives in Bangkok, said he feared a high number of postal votes would not reach the UK in time. The group has partnered with Unlock Democracy and New Europeans UK to investigate people’s experiences this year and come up with solutions for the Electoral Commission.“At the moment, thousands of people could be putting their votes into postboxes around the world and thinking ‘job done’,” said Tom Brake, a former Liberal Democrat MP and the director of Unlock Democracy. “But in reality their vote could be arriving in the UK weeks after polls have closed and never be counted.”New Europeans UK and Unlock Democracy have urged the UK to consider setting up “overseas constituencies”, which would allow British people to place their vote in the country they live in. Seventeen countries including France, Italy, Portugal and Romania operate overseas constituencies.Delays have also been reported in Scotland and England. Postal voters constitute more than a fifth of the electorate.Most schools in Scotland broke up for the summer holidays at the end of June and many people who had hoped to vote by post are on holiday. The first minister, John Swinney, said the problem highlighted that no consideration had been made for Scottish term dates when the election was called.Edinburgh city council set up an emergency facility for lost and delayed postal votes at the weekend with a unit providing replacement documentation in the city chambers open from 9am to 5pm each day until the election. Voters are asked to bring photo ID.A spokesperson said it had issued 370 replacements over the weekend. It had originally sent out 103,581 postal packs. Fife council and Glasgow city council have opened similar facilities.Malcolm Burr, the convener of the electoral management board for Scotland said that for postal voting to be a “viable option”, returning officers “must rely on print suppliers and a predictable and reliable service from Royal Mail”.There are also problems in England. The leader of Uttlesford district council in north-west Essex said 2,644 postal ballots went out nine days late owing to “human error” during the oversight of printing.The council said anyone who had not received their ballot pack by Monday should call the council on 01799 510510 to request a reissue of their ballot paper, which would then be hand delivered. Those who are worried the delay may mean the ballot will not reach the electoral officers on time can submit the pack by hand at the council offices or at any polling station on election day.Southwark council in London has identified problems with postal votes in the SE22 area. A spokesperson said they had “raised this at a senior level with Royal Mail”, which was confident it would deliver all outstanding ballot packs in time.The Electoral Commission has said it will investigate the problem fully after the election.",Thousands fear they will lose vote in UK election after postal ballot delays,20,8
259,"Sir Keir Starmer has been accused of planning to be a “part-time prime minister” after suggesting he would want to finish work at 6pm on Fridays.The Labour leader told Virgin Radio that on the last working day of the week he does “not do a work-related thing after 6pm pretty well come what may”, saying he uses that time to spend with his family.He added that he plans to maintain the habit if his party is elected on Thursday.Asked about the remarks, Rishi Sunak said he had never finished at 6pm and that clocking off so early would not leave enough time to get the job properly done.“What I would say is – what time is it now? – I haven’t finished at 6pm ever,” the Prime Minister said on Monday afternoon.“We would only have a couple of hours left in the day at this point, which is not great.”The comments may raise fears of his party’s workers’ rights agenda, which could lead to shorter hours and four-day weeks.A Conservative Party attack on social media said: “Keir Starmer has said he’d clock off work at 6pm if he became prime minister.“You deserve better than a part-time prime minister. The only way to prevent this is to vote Conservative on Thursday.”Meanwhile a Tory source told The Sun: “Whether he likes it or not, if he became PM, Sir Sleepy would be required to work after 6pm. If he thinks he can just put his slippers on and make a mug of Horlicks while he tunes into The One Show, then he is in for a shock.”Tory sources have previously called the 61-year-old Labour leader “Sleepy Keir”, suggesting that he cannot keep up with 44-year-old Mr Sunak.Speaking on Monday afternoon, Sir Keir said: “We’ve had a strategy in place and we’ll try to keep to it, which is to carve out really protected time for the kids. So on a Friday - I’ve been doing this for years - I will not do a work-related thing after six o’clock, pretty well come what may.“There are a few exceptions, but that’s what we do.”He added: “In politics, some people think if you fill your diary 24/7 and don’t do anything else, that makes you a much better decision maker. I don’t agree with that.“I don’t believe in the theory that you’re a better decision maker if you don’t allow yourself the space to be a dad and have fun with your kids.“Actually, it helps me. It takes me away from the pressure.”Sir Keir says he uses Friday evenings to spend time with his wife, Victoria, and their children - Stefan Rousseau/PA WireThe Labour leader and his wife Victoria have a 16-year-old son and a 13-year-old daughter.Sir Keir said his son and daughter are his “pride and joy”, but suggested his children appeared unimpressed with his political career.After winning a politician of the year award from The Spectator, the Labour leader said his son asked: “How did you blag that, then?”When he was speaking at a fundraising dinner, Sir Keir’s daughter asked: “Why would anyone pay to hear you speak?”“They keep me very, very grounded,” he said.",Starmer mocked for suggesting he will not work past 6pm on Fridays,20,11
377,"With only a few days left until polling day, Rishi Sunak is hoping his pitch to the country – the Conservative manifesto – will help the party pull off a surprise election comeback.The Prime Minister announced his election promises at Silverstone on June 11 under a banner reading “clear plan, bold action, secure future”.The document outlines a further 2 per cent tax cut to National Insurance, the construction of 1.6 million homes over the next Parliament and an increase of the child benefit threshold.Mr Sunak has faced an uphill battle since announcing the snap summer election and is looking to prevent his party from suffering a wipe-out at the hands of Labour, which leads the polls by 20 percentage points.Read the latest election pollsFollow The Telegraph’s general election live coverageBelow, The Telegraph lists the policies the Prime Minister laid out in the 76-page document and what this means for his chances of re-election.NHS and social careTax and spendingEconomyEnvironmentEnergy and ‘Net Zero’Education and childcareDefencePensions and welfarePolicing and crimeMigrationLevelling-UpNHS and social careIncrease NHS spending above inflation each yearDeliver 92,000 more nurses and 28,000 more doctors compared to 2023Deliver 40 new hospitals by 2030Drive up productivity in the NHS and move care closer to people’s homesProvide 2.5 million more NHS dental appointmentsHeadlining the manifesto’s section on health and social care is a pledge to continue to increase NHS spending above inflation in each year of the next parliament.To boost the NHS workforce, the Tories have vowed to deliver 92,000 more nurses and 28,000 more doctors in that time, compared to 2023 levels.The party is standing by Boris Johnson’s controversial pledge to deliver 40 new hospitals by 2030, while investing “proportionately more” in out-of-hospital services over time.It has also vowed to drive up productivity in the NHS and move care closer to people’s homes by utilising pharmacies, new and modernised GP surgeries and more community diagnostic centres.Meanwhile, the party promised to unlock 2.5 million more NHS dental appointments through its Dental Recovery Plan.The manifesto also states that the Tories are committed to supporting a “high-quality and sustainable social care system”, building on existing investment.At the next spending review, the party would give local authorities a “multi-year funding settlement to support social care”.Tax and spendingAbolish national insurance payments for 4m self-employedFurther 2p NI cut for salaried employeesScrap NI entirely “when financial conditions allow”Meet its fiscal rules of public sector net debt fallingReduce public sector net borrowing to below 3 per cent of GDP within five yearsAbolish Stamp Duty on homes worth up to £425,000The Tories have put lower taxes at the heart of their manifesto, with a surprise pledge to abolish National Insurance payments for almost all self-employed people.Mr Sunak said that more than nine in 10 self-employed Brits - some four million workers - would be exempted from the levy under his party’s plans.But under the Tory plans 7 per cent of the highest earning self-employed workers would continue to pay National Insurance.The party would only abolish the main rate of the levy, which is charged at 6 per cent of self-employed earnings between £12,570 and £50,270.An upper rate of 2 per cent, which is applied to profits over £50,270, will remain in place.He said the announcement was “a further downpayment” on the Conservatives’ long-term ambition to abolish the levy entirely.Employee national insurance would also be cut by a further 2p, taking the tax to 6 per cent by April 2027. The party said this would amount to a total tax cut of £1,350 for the average worker on £35,000.It also reiterated its “long-term ambition” to scrap the “double tax on work” entirely when financial conditions allow.The manifesto also includes a pledge to abolish Stamp Duty on homes worth up to £425,000 for first-time buyers and to reintroduce the Help to Buy scheme.EconomyVow not to raise corporation taxEase burden of business rates for high street, leisure and hospitality firmsKeep the VAT threshold “under review”Return the size of the Civil Service to pre-pandemic levels to cut “government bureaucracy”Funnel civil service savings into defenceThe Tories said the “only way to give people peace of mind” that the UK can weather further global shocks is to “get borrowing and debt down”.Therefore, in the next Parliament, the party pledged to continue to meet its fiscal rules of having public sector net debt falling, and for public sector net borrowing to be below 3 per cent of GDP in the fifth year of the forecast.It said the measures in the manifesto are “fully funded” and “would result in lower borrowing in 2029-30”.The Conservatives promised to “always be the party of business”, with a vow not to raise corporation tax. They would also “continue to ease the burden of business rates” for high street, leisure and hospitality firms and keep the VAT threshold “under review”.Read the full 2024 Liberal Democrat manifesto hereMeanwhile, the party pledged to cut “government bureaucracy” by returning the size of the Civil Service to pre-pandemic levels, with the savings funnelled into defence spending.EnvironmentWater bosses to lose bonuses if their firm commits serious criminal breachInvest water company fines in river restoration projectsMore affordable housing for local people in rural areasEmpower councils to manage the growth of holiday letsExpand the UK’s Blue Belt marine conservation schemeNo new restrictions on fox huntingTo combat the sewage crisis blighting Britain’s waterways, the Tories would work with the regulator, Ofwat, to hold companies to account, including banning bonuses for bosses if their firm has committed a serious criminal breach. Proceeds from water companies fines would be used to invest in river restoration projects.The party would cut red tape that “holds back the planting of trees in the planning system”, identifying suitable areas where permits can be streamlined.It would maintain its “record flooding funding” of £5.6 billion over 2021-2027 and champion rural communities by backing farmers with a new legal target for food security.And it would “always stand up for farmers when negotiating new trade deals”.Rishi Sunak greets members of a synagogue in Golders Green, London, on June 30 - James ManningThe Conservatives would boost the availability of affordable housing for local people in rural areas, while ensuring councils have the powers they need to manage “the uncontrolled growth of holiday lets”.Mr Sunak has also vowed not to introduce any new restrictions on fox hunting after Labour said it would ban all forms of hunting with hounds if he wins.He promised not to make any changes to the Hunting Act introduced by Sir Tony Blair in 2004, in a pitch to traditional Tory heartlands.Read the full 2024 Labour manifesto hereThe Tories would consult UK overseas territories on further expanding the Blue Belt programme, the UK’s flagship marine conservation scheme.And the party remains committed to banning the import of hunting trophies and tackling puppy smuggling and livestock worrying.Energy and net zeroCut consumers’ costs by taking a “more pragmatic approach” to the transitionLower green levies on household billsPut forward a vote in Parliament for any new net zero targetNo new green levies or frequent flyer chargeNorth Sea licensing rounds to continue annuallyTreble Britain’s offshore wind capacity and support solar energy “in the right places”The Tories’ central pledge on net zero is to cut the cost for consumers by taking a “more pragmatic approach” to the transition, with green levies on household bills lower in each year of the next Parliament than they were in 2023.The “next stage” of the roadmap would be put to a vote in Parliament, with any new target subject to “proper consideration of the plans and policies required”, in order to “maintain democratic consent for the big decisions that net zero will mean for our country”.The party would reform the Climate Change Committee, giving it an “explicit mandate to consider cost to households and UK energy security” in its future advice.It also ruled out creating any new green levies or a frequent flyer charge.North Sea licensing rounds would continue on an annual basis, in contrast to Labour’s policy. Meanwhile, the Tories would aim to treble Britain’s offshore wind capacity and support solar “in the right places” - crucially “not on our best agricultural land”.It also pledges to look at burying pylons underground and guaranteeing a parliamentary vote on the next stages of the “pathway” of net zero.Education and childcareBan mobile phones during the school dayEnsure parents see what their children are being taught in schoolsTransform post-16 education with new “Advanced British Standard”Create 100,000 apprenticeships by 2029New teachers in priority areas to get bonuses of up to £30k tax-free over five yearsThe Tories would ban mobile phones during the school day and ensure parents can see what their children are being taught, especially on “sensitive matters like sex education”.The party would aim to “transform” post-16 education by introducing a new Advanced British Standard, bringing together academic A-levels and technical T-levels.It has also pledged to create a further 100,000 apprenticeships by 2029, paid for by scrapping “poor quality” degrees.Both primary and secondary schools would be required to deliver two hours of PE every week. To boost recruitment, new teachers in priority areas and sought-after subjects would receive bonuses of up to £30,000 tax-free over five years from September 2024.The Prime Minister’s flagship campaign promise to bring back national service also features in the manifesto.Under the mandatory scheme, 18-year-olds would have to enrol in the military for a year or spend one weekend each month volunteering in their community.DefenceBring back national service for school leaversIncrease military budget to 2.5 per cent of GDP by end of the decade£3 billion in support every year for Ukraine until 2030Introduce a Veterans’ Bill that gives employers tax breaks for hiring themIn his first major policy announcement of the election campaign, Mr Sunak vowed to bring back national service for school leavers, which would open military placements to 30,000 youngsters with residential stays at army barracks or other military facilities.The Conservatives hope the policy will set them apart from Labour as they seek to present themselves as the only party that can be trusted with the UK’s security and defence with multiple threats facing Britain and the world.Mr Sunak warned in a speech in May that a Labour victory represented a threat to UK security.The Prime Minister announced his party would hike the military budget to 2.5 per cent of GDP by the end of the decade - a commitment Labour has failed to match.He also committed to at least £3 billion in support every year for Ukraine until 2030, with both pledges reinforced in the election manifesto.In a major speech at the Policy Exchange think tank on May 13, Mr Sunak argued that Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, would be emboldened by Labour not matching his promise to raise defence spending to 2.5 per cent by 2030.It comes with concerns having been raised about the size of the Army, Navy and Air Force and their struggle to attract enough new recruits.In a tribute to Armed Forces personnel, Mr Sunak will also introduce a Veterans’ Bill to give employers tax breaks for hiring “heroes who have put their lives on the line” and cut the price of rail travel for them.Elsewhere, the Tories pledged to declare China a risk to UK security on a par with Russia and Iran if they win the election.They have committed to adding China to the “enhanced tier” of the UK’s foreign influence registration scheme, meaning all Chinese individuals acting on behalf of the nation would face heightened scrutiny.Pensions and welfare“Quadruple lock” state pension that will never be taxedKeep winter fuel payments, free TV licences and bus passes for pensionersCrackdown on Britain’s welfare billOverhaul sick notes to get more people back into workTougher sanctions for those able to seek work but choose not toMr Sunak declared on May 27 that the state pension will never be taxed under the Conservatives as he unveiled a so-called quadruple lock.The manifesto also promises to keep all other pensioner perks including winter fuel payments, free TV licences and bus passes in place.It adds: “We are carefully considering the Ombudsman report into WASPI women and will work with Parliament to provide an appropriate and swift response.”At the same time it takes a completely different approach when it comes to benefits, with a crackdown on Britain’s ballooning welfare bill set out.The manifesto includes an overhaul of sick notes to get more people back into work and tougher sanctions for those who are able to seek work but choose not to.Policing and crimeTougher sentencing for knife crimeBuild four new jails by 2030, providing 20,000 extra prison placesRecruit an extra 8,000 police officersNew mandatory 25-year sentences for domestic abuse murdersNew police powers to ban protests that pose a risk of serious disorderBan protests outside schoolsThe election campaign will see Mr Sunak and Sir Keir battle it out for who can sound the toughest when it comes to cracking down on crime.Labour has banged the drum on lower-level offences like burglary and antisocial behaviour, painting a picture of a lawless Britain where neighbourhoods live in fear.The Prime Minister has come under pressure to match that rhetoric with harsher sentences for petty criminals and more community payback schemes.His manifesto includes a crackdown on knife crime with tougher sentencing, allowing the Tories to target Sadiq Khan’s record in London.The Tories also pledge to build four new jails by 2030, providing 20,000 extra prison places so that more criminals can be locked up for longer.The dossier also includes a commitment to recruit an extra 8,000 police officers dedicated specifically to tackling neighbourhood crime in a £650 million plan that would take the total number of officers in the UK to its highest level ever at 180,000.And it states that the Tories will “toughen up community sentencing by increasing the use of community payback and electronic tagging, so criminals pay their debt to society and communities witness justice being served”.Elsewhere it contains new mandatory 25-year sentences for domestic abuse murders and commits to a wider review of homicide sentencing which could lead to the creation of US-style first and second-degree murder, increasing the minimum sentence for murders in the home from 15 to 25 years.Find out how Reform UK’s full manifesto comparesThe manifesto also says police will get new powers to ban protests or marches that pose a risk of serious disorder. Chief constables would be able to block marches due to the “cumulative” disruption and “persistent” threats to public order. Police could also be able to recover the costs of policing protests from groups that organised them.Protests outside schools would also be banned to “stop mobs from intimidating teachers and children”. Teachers would be given legal protection from blasphemy accusations following cases such as the Batley school cartoon row where a teacher was forced into hiding.Police and prosecutors would be placed under a new legal duty to publish regular guidance on the statements, chants or symbols, such as the swastika or the term “jihad”, that in the context of political protest may constitute an offence.MigrationBring in a “binding, legal” annual cap on immigrationAnnual vote in Parliament on the visa cap figureLegal migrants must undergo a health check before getting a visaRaise skilled workers’ salary requirements in line with inflation each yearRemove illegal migrants to Rwanda, with monthly flights, starting in July, until the boats are stoppedSign further returns deals similar to the agreement with AlbaniaMr Sunak has been under huge pressure from his own MPs to go into the next election on a cast-iron promise to dramatically cut net migration.The manifesto includes a commitment to bring in a “binding, legal” annual cap on immigration visas but does not say at what number it would be set.Instead Parliament would get an annual vote on the visa cap figure, which would be recommended by the Government’s migration advisers.Legal migrants would be required to undergo a health check before getting a visa as part of a plan to reduce the cost to the NHS of those arriving with conditions.The manifesto also includes a commitment to raise the salary requirements for skilled workers in line with inflation every year “to make sure they don’t undercut UK workers”.On stopping the small boats, it says: “We will run a relentless, continual process of permanently removing illegal migrants to Rwanda with a regular rhythm of flights every month, starting this July, until the boats are stopped.”The manifesto also commits the Government to “sign further returns deals like the one we have already agreed with Albania”.It also says the party will work with other countries to “rewrite” asylum treaties to make them fit for the “challenges” of illegal migration.But it stops short of pledging a referendum on leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, as demanded by some Tory MPs.Instead it only opens the door to the possibility of leaving the convention by vowing to put the security of UK borders ahead of membership of a foreign court.Levelling-upGive 30 towns across UK £20 million eachCreate more freeports and continue backing investment zonesRevitalise high streets by changing planning lawsMake chewing gum manufacturers pay for street cleaningMr Sunak has pledged to give 30 towns across the UK £20 million each in an expansion of the party’s levelling-up policy.The Prime Minister claimed the methodology used to select the towns – including Tamworth, Bognor Regis, Flint, Perth and Newry – had been used “multiple times before” based on “levelling-up needs, looking at economic opportunity, skills, health and life expectancy”.He claimed towns were “neglected” under a previous Labour government and added: “I’m not going to make any apology for supporting towns.“Crucially, it will be local people in all those areas that are in charge of how to spend that money, to make sure it’s spent and invested on their priorities - an example of us levelling up everywhere, backing local people and their priorities, and giving them the long-term funding and assurance to do so,” he said.The manifesto also includes pledges to create more freeports, where businesses get tax breaks for investing, and to continue backing investment zones.Elsewhere it features a commitment to revitalise high streets by changing planning laws and making chewing gum manufacturers pay for street cleaning.“We will change planning laws to support places to bring back local market days and regenerate defunct shopping centres,” it says.",Conservative Party manifesto 2024: Rishi Sunak’s policies for the general election,20,11
48,"Ed Davey has been involved in a number of comedy stunts since the election was called. (Alamy)With the spotlight on prime minister Rishi Sunak and Labour leader Keir Starmer as they prepare to slug it out in a general election campaign, the focus had started slipping from Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey until a series of stunts put him back in the spotlight.The former coalition government cabinet minister – who lost his seat, punished by voters for getting into bed with the Tories, but then won it back again – is sending a clear message that he should not be overlooked.He’s had a long political career and the climax may still be ahead: if polls continue to shift away from the Conservatives at the current trajectory, there’s a slim possibility that he could end up as leader of the opposition.So what do we know about the man behind the third party in British politics? Hannah Fearn finds out.His early lifeEd Davey was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on Christmas Day in 1965. He was the youngest of three boys, but lost his father at just four years old and then his mother when he was in his mid-teens. She had spent three years battling cancer, during which time he nursed his mother together with his grandmother and brother Henry.Once a keen Scout and Air Scout, he later remembers feeling “isolated” at school because of his caring responsibilities, which meant he couldn’t take part in after-school activities or sports. “The last 18 months she was bedridden and in a lot of pain. I’d spend hours on the bed, talking to her,” he said. Davey was with his mother when she died at Nottingham General Hospital, after being placed on an unsuited dementia ward.After both his parents had died, Davey was brought up by his maternal grandparents in the village of Eakring, though his grandfather died soon after. He spent much of his childhood and young adulthood close to his grandmother. “First of all, she was looking after me. Then we were looking after each other,” he said.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

He has attended special schools but is now educated at home with a tutor – a change that Davey said led to him becoming verbal for the first time. He has spoken about his anxiety about who will care for his son when he and his wife are no longer around. “It’s the thing that worries me more than anything else in my life,” Davey said.Gasson was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in 2012. She was well for many years following her diagnosis, but declined during lockdown and is working on recovering her physical strength.Liberal Democrats election broadcast shows Ed Davey with his son. (Liberal Democrats)His parentsHis father, John, was a solicitor and his mother, Nina, a teacher. Davey has described how he was inspired to study by his mother, who always wanted him to try hard academically and who he wanted to impress.His educationDavey attended the private Nottingham High School, the alma mater of former chancellor Kenneth Clarke. He became head boy, with Labour MP Ed Balls – who was studying in the year below – watching on.After school, he achieved a first class degree in philosophy, politics and economics at Jesus College, Oxford where he was junior common room president. After becoming an economics researcher for the Liberal Democrats he returned to study, reading for a master’s degree in economics at Birkbeck College, London.Ed Davey, pictured with his family. (Liberal Democrats)Why is he a Sir?For three years, the Lib Dem leader was a member of the cabinet in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition government, holding the post of secretary of state for energy and climate change from 2012 to 2015. He was knighted in the 2016 New Year’s Honours for “political and public services”.Davey on... the cost of living crisisDavey has repeatedly attacked the government for failing to curb rapid inflation and the devastating effect it is having on household budgets. He called the Conservative Party “so out of touch they might as well be living on another planet”, and said he warned Jeremy Hunt “people are desperate for real help… but all the chancellor could offer is empty words and unfair tax hikes”.In particular, he has urged more action on food price inflation, which analysis from his own party found had risen 37% in one year for the average weekly supermarket trip. He has promised to end energy hikes and abandoned his plan to add 1p to income tax to save the NHS because ordinary voters can no longer afford it.Davey on... the NHSThe Liberal Democrats have made the NHS a cornerstone of their policy platform for the last five years. In Davey’s words: “Voting Conservative is bad for your health.” He promises to reverse cuts to GP numbers and guarantee a doctor’s appointment when you need one, improve access to NHS dentistry and save lives by tackling ambulance call out delays.Davey blames the care crisis for deepening the problems of the health service and says his party would spend £5bn a year on a “care package” to ensure patients are discharged from hospital more quickly, freeing up bed space. However, there is little detail on how this would be financed without raising taxes on the wealthiest - which Davey has promised not to do in his push to poach disillusioned Tory voters.Sir Ed Davey was a member of the Tory-Lib Dem government. (Reuters)Davey on... immigrationThe Lib Dem leader has been a long-standing advocate for refugee rights and critic of the government’s immigration policy. Davey has called for Conservative plans to deport failed asylum seekers to Rwanda a “cynical distraction” from the Partygate crisis and the money would be better spent on measures to tackle the cost of living crisis. He added: “They’ve provided no evidence to suggest that this new policy will stop illegal smuggling, they’re not cracking down on the organised crime gangs, which is what you need to do.”Davey has called for a new right to work for refugees and asylum seekers, and major reform of the Home Office, which he says is no longer up to the job. After the end of the coalition government in 2015, Davey has said his party “was wrong” to go along with the introduction of a minimum income standard for immigrants. He later described the policy as “nasty and unfair”.Davey on... the Post Office scandalDespite the Post Office scandal that led to the wrongful prosecution of more than 700 subpostmasters crossing the tenure of more than a dozen business secretaries, Davey has recently taken the heat for failing to investigate the issue while he was in the job.It has emerged that while a minister, Davey initially rejected a request to meet justice campaigner Alan Bates, and later accepted it only on the advice that it would be good for his PR.

291,"Tactical voting and disaffection with mainstream parties make this Thursday a once-in-a-lifetime general election that could reshape the political landscape for decades, the leader of the Liberal Democrats has argued.With a series of smaller parties expected to make breakthroughs in terms of vote share and seats, Ed Davey said the Lib Dems seemed poised to entrench themselves in a swathe of formerly Conservative territory, particularly in the south.“I think this is a once-in-a-century election,” the Lib Dem leader told the Guardian between campaign stops in Tory-held seats. “I mean, 1997 was a once-in-a-generation. This is a once-in-a-century.”Launching the final week of his defiantly unorthodox campaign with a bungee jump at a football ground in Eastbourne followed by a Zumba class in John Redwood’s former seat of Wokingham, Davey insisted such antics had brought attention to party policies in areas such as social care and sewage in rivers.“We’ve never seen Liberal Democrat policies talked about as much,” Davey said, speaking in a rear section of the party’s battlebus festooned with wetsuit tops and swimming shorts drying on the backs of the seats.“Isn’t that weird? When we’ve done it from a lectern in a suit at a press conference, people don’t want to talk about our policies. When I fall off a paddleboard or go down a waterslide, people talk about our policies. I like to think we are running a positive campaign, a bit of fun but mixed with serious messages.“After I did the bungee jump, one of the guys who works at the football club stopped me, saying that he looks after his dad and what we’re saying about care and carers is so important.”While the Lib Dems are at pains not to formally reveal how many target seats they are focusing on, an initial focus of about 50 has expanded as formerly unwinnable constituencies including Stratford-on-Avon and South Cotswolds have come into play.Dislike of the Conservatives and an increased willingness for people to vote tactically to remove Tory MPs could have a particular impact in such areas, Davey said.“We will take out a lot of Conservatives,” he said, arguing that formerly ultra-safe Tory areas such as Henley, once represented by Boris Johnson, and Witney, David Cameron’s former seat, were on “a knife-edge” and Sussex was “looking incredible”.“People are realising that this is a quite extraordinary election. They need to vote tactically to get out the Conservatives. In many cases, that’s us,” he said. “People should recognise that this is an election where you can literally change the political geography of our country, and for a long time. Be brave, do something different.”While the same polls that have said the Lib Dems could end up with 60 or more seats have also predicted gains for the Greens and Reform UK, Davey said it could be harder for these parties, given the need for resources and, apart from in a few places for the Greens, a base of local councillors on which to build.In the 2019 election, Davey said, the Lib Dems “started fighting places where we hadn’t got councillors”, piling up more votes but producing just 11 MPs, an experience that directly led to the current ultra-focused campaign.Some polls have said the Lib Dems could even end up with more MPs than the Conservatives, becoming the main opposition. Davey, however, said the only target was to overtake the Scottish National party and become the third biggest party in the Commons.“What I can say is our campaign is [going] better than we had expected,” he said. “I’m going to seats that I hadn’t expected to. But I’m cautious as well, because we don’t want to overstretch ourselves.“The Tories have helped us because they have been so awful. I’m happy to concede that. The desire to remove this shockingly bad government has focused people’s minds and they have looked beyond the tribal lines in a way which I haven’t seen before.“There is a chance that people will vote for the party best placed to beat the Conservatives, and people know in the south of England and the south-west that’s us, broadly speaking.”Much of the campaign success so far has hinged on Davey’s willingness to throw himself into a variety of camera-friendly stunts. He began Monday morning bungee jumping from a platform hoisted by a vast crane at Eastbourne’s football club, yelling “Vote Liberal Democrat!” as he fell.Hours later, wearing an orange-pink T-shirt and black shorts, Davey was enthusiastically joining in with a Zumba class in a Wokingham park, carrying on for several songs, by which point most of the photographers had stopped taking pictures.While large parts of Thursday’s outcome remain in doubt, Davey said he was certain of one thing. Asked if this was the most fun he had had in an election campaign, he replied immediately: “Yes. Without a doubt.”",Ed Davey uses bungee jump to hail ‘once-in-a-century election’,20,8
57,"For all her bravado in government, Nicola Sturgeon wasn’t much of a gambler – at least not a successful one. She bet against the UK government and the Supreme Court that she could hold another referendum on independence – more commonly referred to as indyref2 – and she failed on both counts.First, Downing Street said she wouldn’t be allowed to do it legally, and when she pressed her case, a unanimous verdict of Britain’s most senior judges agreed that she’d be breaking the law if she tried it on her own.She then staked a great deal on being responsible for making Scotland a world leader in terms of gender reform legislation, and cajoled and browbeat her party and parliament into agreeing with her controversial measure to give effect to that change.But on this occasion it was killed off first by public opinion, led by the country’s best-known author, and by the Scotland Act, which had given effect to the Holyrood parliament and declared that what she was planning was unconstitutional.Nicola Sturgeon bet against the UK government and the Supreme Court that she could hold another referendum on independence - Jane Barlow/PAThese were signal defeats but it would appear that the SNP leadership doesn’t want to know when gambling doesn’t pay.Just about the sole weapon in current leader John Swinney’s campaign war chest is that he will be able to declare that he has a mandate for Scottish independence if the SNP win the majority of the constituencies in Thursday’s election. In other words, if he leads his troops to triumph in 29 seats or more out of Scotland’s 57, he will be entitled to say to whoever is prime minister on Thursday night that it’s time to begin the independence negotiations to break up Britain.However, just because Swinney repeats this claim at every opportunity doesn’t mean that he’s likely to achieve that aim – it’s a gamble, pure and simple.Polls suggest Mr Swinney's SNP could lose more than half the 48 seats it won at the last election - Wattie CheungThe opinion polls are very much against him getting anywhere near that total, with some suggesting he could lose more than half the 48 seats that the SNP won at the last election and a number predicting that he might be down to a tiny total – perhaps in single figures.Such losses would in themselves be a total humiliation but wouldn’t they also mean that if a majority of seats meant independence was well and truly on the cards, then wouldn’t a minority mean the opposite, i.e. that independence was a dead letter?The First Minister was asked this question time without number, most recently by the Today presenter Mishal Husain, but he ducks and weaves and refuses to answer this straight question. Instead, he havers on about how in the last Scottish Parliament election, in 2021, the SNP won 64 and the Greens eight of the 129 seats.These 72 votes, he continues to insist, constituted a majority in favour of independence and therefore provided a mandate to begin talks on taking Scotland out of the UK.Mr Swinney is aiming to lead the SNP to triumph in 29 seats or more out of Scotland's 57 - Michael Boyd/PABut he refuses even to discuss the possibility that if his party gets less than a majority of Scottish seats on Thursday, then it’s “goodbye independence” for the foreseeable future.However, it’s one thing for political leaders to pretend that all is well – there are others doing it, after all – but entirely another when they refuse to admit that there’s another side to the argument they’re putting before the electorate.John Swinney is not noted for being a gambler. It’s a bit late for him to be starting now.","When general election dealing is done, will SNP’s independence bet prove an unwise gamble?",20,11
274,"Sir Keir Starmer is being urged to abandon Rishi Sunak’s “sneaky” post-Brexit wine tax if he wins the keys to Downing Street this week.Britain’s wine drinkers will have to pay a little-known “sauvignon surcharge” from February next year, as part of changes brought in after the UK left the European Union.As the prime minister uses the election campaign to repeatedly accuse Labour of planning secret tax rises if they get into power, experts and industry leaders have today called for his booze levy to be dropped.They warn that it will lead to products disappearing from the shelves, raise the price of some red wines by more than 40p a bottle, and increase the number of tax bands for wine from one to 30.Now, in a letter to the country’s next leader, seen by The Independent, they say the next government “must act” to avoid “needless cost increases and unnecessary red tape”.Experts warn some wines will become more expensive – and some could disappear from the shelves entirely (Getty/iStock)The call is backed by former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who told The Independent that the new tax “is complex and could lead to misunderstandings”.The letter has been signed by 58 names including the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, Adam Guy, the managing director of Laurent-Perrier (UK) Limited and James Davy, the chairman of Davy’s Wine Merchants.John Colley, the boss of Majestic Wine, which has more than 200 shops across the country, told The Independent that the changes will “increase prices and threaten the quality and choice of wines that UK consumers are currently able to enjoy”.He said that the change “does not make any sense”, adding: “Everyone is a loser here – small business, consumers and the Treasury – and the policy needs to be stopped before it is too late.”Labour MP Neil Coyle said: “If it fixes Sunak’s mess on this issue and raises more for the Treasury by making the change, then I hope any new government will urgently review Sunak’s sneaky Sauvignon surcharge, this hit from the Tories on all wine drinkers.”When Mr Sunak announced the changes in the 2021 spending review, he declared them a Brexit benefit and promised they would lead to a system that was “simpler, fairer, and healthier”.When he first unveiled the changes Rishi Sunak declared them a Brexit benefit (PA Wire)However, the plans have sparked a backlash from the UK wine industry.The new regime taxes alcohol based on strength for the first time. Previously, levies were applied based on categories of wine, beer, spirits and ciders. But when it comes to wine, experts warn that, unlike in other drinks, alcohol levels vary due to a variety of factors, including the weather, and risk becoming a matter of guesswork.Because of the outcry, when the changes were brought in for other types of booze in August last year, ministers introduced a temporary flat tax for all wines between 11.5 per cent and 14.5 per cent alcohol by volume. This represents 85 per cent of the more than one billion bottles sold each year in the UK. But that temporary fix is due to end at the start of February.Hal Wilson, the co-founder of Cambridge Wine Merchants, said: “Imagine going to a petrol station and the price of fuel changes before, during and after you fill up your tank. Pretty bizarre, but what the government’s planned changes to wine duty will be like for importers and consumers from February 2025.“The new unworkable and unnecessary tax regime will mean ever-changing and unpredictable amounts of duty to be payable on the vast majority of wine. The cost of calculating these new amounts of tax, combined with the physical increases, will put wine prices up for consumers, [when they] are already running at three times the rate of inflation. The UK, the world’s second-largest import market for wine, will have gone from the most desirable place to do business with to one of the least, affecting everyone who likes a glass.”Labour and the Conservatives have been approached for comment.",‘Sneaky Sauvignon surcharge’: Next prime minister urged to dump Sunak’s post-Brexit wine tax,20,9
366,"When Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader spoke at events seven years ago, crowds blocked roads and scaled street furniture to catch sight of him. Chants of “Oh Jeremy Corbyn!” boomed around stadiums and music festivals, and the bearded politician took on the aura of a rock star.But the lead-up to the 2024 general election has been a significantly more muted episode. At a time when Tory voters appear to have deserted their party and the political battleground is closer to the centre-right, previous Corbyn supporters have been left politically adrift, feeling sidelined and ignored by the major parties.For those swept up in the movement, 2017 was a time brimming with optimism and possibility, pushing back against the misery of a Tory government and a brutal regime of austerity that was driving millions into poverty.“It felt like this amazing euphoria of suddenly the whole country had started to back Corbynism,” said Gerard Corvin, who began canvassing for the party that year. “It was fun to be knocking on doors for the first time. I remember going out several times in constituencies near me, which were tight, and it felt like I was winning people around. And that was really, really inspiring.”Alexander Hulme, an actor, first got involved with Labour in 2017 when he went to canvassing groups organised by Momentum. Later, in the run-up to the 2019 election, he was hired for viral videos, first by Momentum and then by the party.Characters he played included an underpaid and overworked firefighter, a tech billionaire rubbing taxpayers’ money all over his face, a naked footballer, and Batman (whose wealth was held in an offshore tax haven), in videos that garnered tens of millions of views. “I was just over the moon to be able to help by doing something that was fun,” he said.“I wouldn’t call it a waste of time,” Hulme said, reflecting on how the videos ultimately were not part of a winning campaign. “I was trying to get a decent Labour party elected. It didn’t happen, and that was very sad. And then I sort of tuned out a bit afterwards.”Does Batman really need a Bat-Yacht? 🦇#Joker #Batman #JokerMovie pic.twitter.com/Vu3wEBiHGo— Momentum 🌹 (@PeoplesMomentum) November 12, 2019He was not the only one. At the peak in 2017, the Labour party had 564,443 members, making it the largest political party in western Europe. As of March this year, Labour’s membership had plummeted to 366,604.Joseph-Dodo Levin is another one of those who eventually left the party. He had joined after spending years frustrated by the Conservatives’ claim that austerity was necessary to fix the broken economy. “Jeremy Corbyn was the strongest and first politician to come along to really challenge that narrative. And I still think that’s the correct analysis,” he said. “It was very special, that little window of hope.”But it was a difficult time, he said, especially as someone from a Jewish family feeling that the media were only interested in the Jewish voices who attacked Corbyn, and not those who defended him. “During that period, I think 2018, I cried a lot. I felt quite shaken by it. I felt like I turned on the TV and I was being attacked. It was a really emotional time for me,” he said.In 2024, his main issue is the “guilt by association” levelled at more leftwing party members such as the former Tyne mayor Jamie Driscoll and the Chingford and Woodford Green candidate Faiza Shaheen, whom Levin had campaigned for, who were blocked from standing for the party.He said he was trying to encourage others on the left to put their unspent energy into improving electoral systems so people could vote with their conscience. “I think that across society people are demoralised. They’ve lost trust in politics and lost faith in electoral politics,” Levin said.First past the post was the biggest problem in this election for most former Labour supporters the Guardian spoke to. Many voiced frustration at feeling a need to support a party they felt had betrayed them, in order to keep the Conservatives out of government – something they said Corbyn’s critics had refused to do in 2017 and 2019.“Those supposedly on the left who are suddenly decrying the Tories in 2024 but basically previously campaigned against Labour – I just despair,” said Aimee, 33.This election she would “be the bigger person” and vote tactically, she said. “I am voting Labour this time but only because I feel so anxious about being trapped in another Tory government. I know people say it can’t happen, I know, I know, but they said Brexit wouldn’t happen and look at the mess we’re in now.”Hulme’s stint as Batman led to him starting a superhero company with some friends and he has been out in Islington, where he lives, dressed as Spider-Man in support of Corbyn’s campaign as an independent, after the former leader was ousted from the party.He said: “My involvement with Labour started and ended with Corbyn, really. Luckily I live in his constituency, so who I’m going to vote for is an easy decision.”For many, the fact that Labour is predicted to claim a landslide victory will allow them to vote for another party that more closely aligns with their beliefs – with the Green party likely to pick up a large proportion of these votes, based on the leanings of those who spoke to the Guardian.Corvin is one of those who will vote Green on Thursday. He said: “I’m not wanting to sound like I’m just undermining all of the enthusiasm I had for political change then, but I do look back on that period and think that was an unhealthy amount of energy and emotion to place in the fortunes of one political party or one politician in just a small, relatively insignificant country.“There’s so much more happening in the world and [not being a Labour member] doesn’t stop you from engaging in protest and caring about the environment and caring about what’s happening in Gaza. And there are other ways of expressing that than just via the fortunes of a political party.”",‘I tuned out a bit’: ex-Jeremy Corbyn supporters left adrift in election,20,8
120,"Labour's predicted share of the vote at the general election has fallen to its lowest level in months, according to recent projections.A model by research firm JL Partners, made for the Sunday Times, predicts Sir Keir Starmer's party to win 38% of the vote.This is a sizeable fall from 48% predicted by pollsters YouGov on 7 May and comes after the Labour leader's final televised debate against Rishi Sunak on the BBC on Wednesday.The head-to-head saw the Tory leader rip into Starmer's policies, accusing him of ""not being straight with people"" on issues including migration and tax.However, Labour is still riding high compared to its opponents, with JL Partners' latest model putting the party on track to win 450 seats, with a substantial majority of 250.Meanwhile the Tories are set to be reduced to just 105 seats, compared to the 365 they won in 2019 – spelling one of the party's biggest defeats on record.Here, Yahoo News UK summaries the positions of the parties according to three separate opinion polls.Tories to be left 'small and unfamiliar', new super-poll predictsThe number of senior Tory MPs expected to lose their seats after 4 July is ""too many to get your head round"", Scarlett Maguire of JL Partners told Times Radio.“If you take into account who will lose their seats along with who has already announced they will be stepping down, you really are left with, first, a small Conservative Party, with, you know, just 105 seats, but one that also doesn’t have that many familiar faces in it,"" she said.(JLP)JL Partners' projections have been made using a stacked regression post-stratification (SRP) model, which it says uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to gather more accurate and detailed results.It builds on a form of modelling known as multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) – models that break the electorate down into small demographic chunks, predict their voting behaviour and then ""build"" a version of each seat in the country from the right mixture of demographics.SRP uses AI to combine estimates from many models into a single final estimate. Explaining why this is such a big deal in the world of political modelling, JLP says: ""The main advantage of this kind of stacking is that we can use different models to probe different parts of the data giving a more holistic set of predictions that consider many different facets of the data.""This includes models that are superior at unpicking the constituency level predictors whilst other models can investigate the individual level effects in much more detail.""Some models, like multilevel regression, can analyse both the individual level and constituency level data simultaneously. The combination of these models then produces estimates that more accurately represent the nuances in the underlying data.""Other noteworthy prediction in JLP's model, described as a ""super poll"" by the Times' chief political commentator Tim Shipman, is Reform UK winning two seats, with Nigel Farage predicted to win Clacton and Lee Anderson, who defected from the Tories in March, keeping hold of Ashfield.The Liberal Democrats are also tracked to regain their place as the third party of British politics, going from just 11 seats in the Commons to 55, while the Scottish National Party (SNP) are set to lose 33 seats, leaving only 15.The level of detail in JLP's model means the company has been able to put together a list of major Conservative MPs expected to lose their seats, including Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Grant Shapps, Mel Stride and Esther McVey.You can search for your constituency to find the projected winner and their margin of victory here. Reform UK snapping at Tories' heels as Labour takes dipYouGov's voting intention tracker currently predicts Labour to win 37% of the vote.Although it is still by far the highest scoring political party, it is a significant drop from the 47% recorded on 28 May – six days after Sunak called a surprise snap general election.There is only a 2% margin between Reform UK and the Tories, according to YouGov, with the Conservative's projected to win 20% of the vote, compared to 18% for Nigel Farage's party.Labour vote share drops to 'lowest in over two years'In another sign that Labour's success has plateaued, a recent poll for the Telegraph suggests there is only a 17% gap between the Tories and Starmer's party.This would leave Labour with its lowest predicted vote share since January 2022, when Boris Johnson was still prime minister, according to pollsters Savanta.However, this is unlikely to worry Starmer, as the poll still puts Labour on track to win 38% of the vote and a majority of more than 260 seats.🚨NEW Westminster Voting Intention for Sunday @Telegraph📈Lowest Labour vote share since January 2022🌹Lab 38 (-4)🌳Con 21 (=)➡️Reform 14 (=)🔶LD 11 (+1)🌍Green 6 (+1)🎗️SNP 2 (-1)⬜️Other 7 (+1)2,092 UK adults26-28 June (chg from 21-24 June) pic.twitter.com/cdyp3lJygQ— Savanta UK (@Savanta_UK) June 29, 2024Chris Hopkins, the director of political research at Savanta, told the Telegraph: “This is our lowest Labour vote share since Rishi Sunak became prime minister, and the Conservatives for their part do appear to have slowed or stopped their downward spiral.""He added that a rise in vote share for the Green Party and independent candidates will not have a significant impact on election day but could ""point towards trouble for the Labour Party in government and over the coming years"".What are the latest odds?As of 1 July, Oddschecker – a website which compares odds across different bookmakers – had Labour at 1/41 to win the most seats. To put that in context, this is seen as so likely that a £10 bet would return just £10.24.Bookies are putting the Conservatives at 125/1 to win the most seats, or to win a majority, with both scenarios so unlikely that a £10 punt would return £1,260.Reform UK has better chances, according to Oddschecker, with 80/1 odds of winning the most seats in the general election and 100/1 odds of having an overall majority.What went wrong for the Tories?So, why have the polls changed so dramatically? It's worth looking back on an extremely eventful four-and-a-half years in UK politics.According to YouGov's voting intention tracker (see chart above), Tory support peaked at 53%, with Labour on 32%, in April 2020, months after the party's stunning success in the 2019 general election and Boris Johnson's pledge to “get Brexit done”. That month also saw Starmer take over as Labour leader from Jeremy Corbyn.This was also amid a spirit of national unity following the onset of the COVID pandemic which nearly killed Johnson himself. The then-PM had been released from hospital five days before this particular survey was taken.Boris Johnson delivers his final speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street in September 2022. (AFP via Getty Images)Over the rest of the year, there was a downturn in support amid chaos over COVID rules, with the Tories falling as low as 35% in November 2020, compared to Labour on 40%.However, the UK’s successful COVID vaccination programme provided a pathway out of lockdown and with it, improved poll ratings. Tory support peaked at 41% in June 2021, with Labour at 30%.In October that year, there was a sense Johnson was untouchable. At the Tory party conference, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg remarked how the PM was ""in total command of his party, and politically dominant in the country"".But this fell apart quickly with the Partygate scandal, which emerged in November that year. Time and again, reports emerged of government and Tory staff – including Johnson – having taken part in lockdown-era social gatherings when their own COVID rules had prohibited them.By January 2022, Tory support had plummeted to 28%, with Labour on 38%. Johnson struggled on, but never recovered and a wave of ministerial resignations forced him to resign in July that year.The UK had three separate prime ministers – Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak – between 6 September and 24 October, 2022. (Getty Images)His successor, Liz Truss, then embarked on arguably the most disastrous prime ministerial reign in history, characterised by the catastrophic ""mini-budget"", containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, which prompted an economic crisis. Like Johnson, she lost the confidence of Tory MPs – and voters – and had to resign.Her 49-day spell as PM was the shortest in history, with Tory support plummeting to 19% (with Labour on 56%) the day after she announced her resignation in October 2022.Rishi Sunak, who had lost to Truss in the previous month's Tory leadership election, took over. However, as the above YouGov chart indicates, he has failed to cut through with voters. Tory support was at 23% two days after he assumed office, with the most recent survey, carried out on Thursday, showing support is now lower than under Truss at 18%.In short, the polls and odds, not to mention other factors such as notable by-election victories for Starmer's Labour, are pointing to a Labour government next week.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

42,"Campaigners have called for the Electoral Commission to be given powers to investigate discriminatory language used in campaigns after multiple Reform UK candidates were engulfed in racism rows.During the six week campaign Reform has been forced to ditch at least 11 parliamentary candidates over accusations they made racist comments on social media, including one prospective MP who said African people had among the “lowest IQs in the world.Last week canvasser Andrew Parker, referred to prime minister Rishi Sunak as a “f***ing p***” in undercover footage from a Channel 4 investigation. Essex Police said it is “urgently assessing” Mr Parker’s remarks to establish if there are any criminal offences. And Reform UK candidates were found to be members of a public Facebook group that regularly posts racist messages such as a post stating there should be “no race mixing” and that “the only thing black a white woman should have is black leather”.Andrew Parker was recorded using offensive slur against the prime minister (Channel 4)But despite widespread outrage, the commission says it can only investigate and sanction parties for breaches of the political finance and imprint laws.Labour’s Bell Ribeiro-Addy, former MP for Streatham and who is running for Clapham and Brixton Hill, is among those calling for the watchdog’s remit to be broadened.“Overseeing our democratic functions should include a responsibility to protect all citizens from racism and bigotry,” she told The Independent. “Discrimination is against our laws and any political party using racist, homophobic, disabilist or misogynist language should face consequences. During an election the most obvious body to police the type of hateful language we have seen used by the Reform UK campaign is the electoral commission.”The calls come as Europe experiences a surge in far right parties, including Marine Le Pen’s National Rally which is leading in the first round of a snap election called by Emmanuel Macron.Femi Oluwole was removed from Reform UK’s rally in Birmingham on Sunday (Femi Oluwole)Campaign group Grassroots Black Left said it is seeing: “an alarming current surge in support for the nationalist far right in Europe, including France, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy. All of them have achieved success by disguising their previously overt racism, Islamophobia, antisemitism, xenophobia and other forms of disgusting bigotry to fool voters. The Electoral Commission needs to have the powers to intervene as a supposed regulator.”Black columnist Femi Oluwole was removed from a Reform rally by security guards over the weekend. He told The Independent that the last few years have revealed the UK’s political system “doesn’t have anything close to the safeguards it needs”.“Blatant hate speech and death threats have been used by senior politicians without lasting consequence,” he said. “All of this must change. The electoral commission should ban anyone who is found to have acted unlawfully in office from standing again - and we need stricter laws on hate speech from politicians.“I don’t believe in arresting every citizen who says something racist. But if a politician goes on national TV and dishonesty brands almost half of British Muslims as terrorist supporters, that is implied incitement.”Mr Oluwole cited a Sky News interview last month, where Mr Farage, the former Ukip leader said: “We have a growing number of young people in this country who do not subscribe to British values, (who) in fact loathe much of what we stand for.”When asked if he was talking about Muslims, Farage replied: “We are. … And I’m afraid I found some of the recent surveys saying that 46 per cent of British Muslims support Hamas – support a terrorist organisation that is proscribed in this country.”The survey asked British Muslims who they have more empathy for out of Hamas and Israel.Labour’s Bell Ribeiro-Addy says the Electoral Commission needs to police offensive campaigning (PA)During a TV interview in 2017, Mr Farage said “frankly, if you open your door to uncontrolled immigration from Middle Eastern countries, you are inviting in terrorism.”Concerns have been raised that such divisive rhetoric is being normalised. From Enoch Powell’s racist ‘Rivers of Blood’ speech in 1968 to former prime minister Boris Johnson, who called burka-wearing Muslim women “letterboxes”, Black Lives Matter UK pointed to a history of political figures “leveraging racism for their gain”.“The rise of Reform UK has been deeply troubling, and it is not surprising that members of Reform UK have been caught making racist remarks while campaigning,” a BLM UK spokesperson told The Independent. While pointing out that addressing racist campaigning was not within its remit, the Electoral Commission urged those involved in political campaigns to be “respectful”.Enoch Powell is notorious for his hateful ""Rivers of Blood"" speech“Campaigning is a vital part of our democratic process and usually carried out respectfully. However, our research has shown that harassment and abuse of candidates has become too common,” a spokesperson said. “Campaigning can and should take place without the use of inflammatory language or anyone experiencing abuse.“We urge campaigners to talk to their staff and volunteers about the importance of safe and respectful campaigning.”Reform UK was approached for comment.Nigel Farage claimed Reform’s ‘bad apples’ have been rooted out (Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

201,"Rishi Sunak has only campaigned in five out of the 45 seats where top Tories face being ousted from parliament. via Associated PressRishi Sunak has been avoiding campaigning in seats where top Tories could be kicked out, according to new analysis.Research from campaign group Best for Britain has concluded that the prime minister has only actively lobbied for the Tories in five of the 45 constituencies where high-profile members of his own party could be ousted at the general election.That means he has dodged nine in every 10 of the swing seats – a large proportion, considering his party are facing electoral oblivion.As of June 28, Sunak has travelled to Central Devon, where work and pensions secretary Mel Stride is standing, Suffolk Coastal, where his friend Therese Coffey is hoping to be re-elected, and Tory party deputy chair Jonathan Gullis’s Stoke-on-Trent North constituency.He has also popped up in science secretary Michelle Donelan’s  Melkhsham and Devizes seat, as well as his own constituency, Richmond and Northallerton in Yorkshire.But in the 15 most marginal areas, where candidates are within 5% of winning or losing, he has not campaigned at all.While it could be Sunak’s decision not to appear in those constituencies, Best for Britain’s analysis comes after reports that candidates have refused offers for the PM to campaign with them in their seats.Back in May, incumbent Tory mayors distanced themselves from the prime minister during their campaigns by avoiding any clear Conservative branding.Ben Houchen – who was re-elected as Tees Valley mayor – did not mention Sunak or the Tories in his victory speech, either.Even Sunak loyalist and defence secretary, Grant Shapps, seems to be trying to distance himself from his own government, as his campaign leaflets do not feature any mention of Sunak or clear affiliation to the Conservatives.The Conservative Party has been contacted for comment.Chief executive of Best for Britain, Naomi Smith, said: “Sunak’s problem is that even his own party doesn’t want him around, let alone the public.“We need a clean break from him, his party and the damage they have caused over he past 14 years, and the best way voters can ensure the Tories are locked out of power for at least a decade is by voting tactically.”Best for Britain launched its tactical voting website, GetVoting.org, in June to advise the electorate on how to vote in each constituency to help oust the Tories and keep far-right group Reform out of parliament.If the polls are right, there is a large set of Tory big beasts who could be facing a “Portillo moment” – named after the minister who unexpectedly lost his safe seat in the 1997 general election.Former cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg, Welsh secretary David Davies, chancellor Jeremy Hunt, veteran minister Johnny Mercer and former PM Liz Truss could all be facing the scrapheap.Related...Rishi Sunak Was Met With Ridicule After Comparing England's Dramatic Victory To The General ElectionDesperate Rishi Sunak Goes Full Project Fear As Tories Brace For Election WipeoutRishi Sunak Has Insisted He Is 'Proud' Of The Tories' Disastrous Election Campaign",Rishi Sunak Is Notably Absent From Seats Where Famous Tories Could Be Ousted,20,3
341,"The son of a toolmaker and the first of his family to go to university, Sir Keir Starmer is the most working class Labour Party leader in a generation.Yet when focus groups are asked what they think his favourite drink is, they guess that he’s partial to a gin and tonic rather than a pint down the local boozer. Many also assume his title is hereditary.Here's what you need to know about the personal life of the man who wants to be the UK’s next prime minister.His early lifeStarmer was born in Southwark, south London, in 1962, as the second of four children. His parents were Labour Party members and named him after Keir Hardie, the party’s first leader in parliament.The family moved out of the capital and he grew up in Hurst Green, a village just outside the small Surrey town of Oxted. He was active in youth politics from his teenage years but was also a skilled musician, taking music lessons alongside Norman Cook, who later became better known as a member of The Housemartins and the DJ Fatboy Slim.Starmer played the flute, piano, violin and recorder and was a junior exhibitioner at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.His familyStarmer with his wife, Lady Victoria Starmer, at the Labour Party Conference in October 2023. (Alamy)Starmer is married to Victoria, a former solicitor who later retrained in occupational health and now works for the NHS. The pair met through their work in the law in the early 2000s and married in Essex in 2007.She was first seen accompanying her husband when the couple were filmed clapping for carers during the pandemic in 2020 outside their home in Camden. They have two children, a son and daughter, but both are kept out of the public eye.Victoria's father was Jewish and originally came from Poland, while her mother converted when they got married. Starmer has said in a previous interview that ""my wife in particular wants our children to know the faith of her family"" and that they ""observe some of the practices, for example Friday night prayers"".His parentsKeir Starmer with parents, Rodney and Josephine, at his graduation. (Twitter/Keir Starmer)The Labour leader's father, Rodney Starmer, worked as a toolmaker in a factory, and his mother Josephine Starmer (née Baker), was a nurse.His father worked long, 14-hour days but spent his time outside work caring for Josephine, who was diagnosed with the autoimmune condition Still’s disease. She required two hip and knee replacements twice in her lifetime and struggled with arthritic pain.As a young man Starmer also helped care for his mother, which he has said led to him being more emotionally reserved. His sister, Katy, recalled: “He’s had to be a grown-up all his life. I’ve always been quite open about my feelings – Keir is good at most things, but not that.” Josephine Starmer died in 2015, and his father three years later.His educationA photograph of a younger Starmer as shown on ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories in 2021. (ITV)Starmer passed the 11-plus examination, and attended Reigate Grammar School from age 11. While he was at the school it became an independent fee-paying institution, but as an existing student he was exempt from fees, and his tuition in the sixth form was covered by a bursary.After school he studied law at the University of Leeds, this first in his family to attend university, graduating with a first class degree in 1985. He undertook postgraduate law studied at the University of Oxford, where he served as editor of a radical magazine, Socialist Alternatives.Why is he a sir?Keir Starmer pictured in 2010, when he was director of public prosecutions, making a statement about MPs who face charges over their expenses claims. (Getty)Starmer was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 2014 in recognition of his work in the legal profession, culminating in a five-year term as director of public prosecutions (DPP).He first became a barrister in 1987 at the Middle Temple, later joining Doughty Street Chambers and was appointed a Queen’s counsel in 2002, aged just 39. In 2008 he was appointed head of the Crown Prosecution Service and DPP.During his tenure he chose to prosecute three Labour MPs and a Conservative in the wake of the parliamentary expenses scandal, and was responsible for prosecuting former MP Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce for perverting the course of justice after Pryce claimed responsibility for her former husband’s speeding offence.",Who is Keir Starmer?

351,"Thousands of people fear they will be unable to vote in the general election with delays, human error and Brexit being blamed for missing postal ballot packs in the UK and abroad.Clarissa Killwick, a British citizen living in Italy, said she could not trust the post to deliver her vote in time.“I decided to leave nothing to chance and will be going to the UK to vote in person,” said Killwick, who runs a Brexit campaign group for UK citizens in Italy.Another said they had to courier their ballot back to the UK.Vienna-based Michael Goldrei said Hackney council in London told him his pack had been posted on 17 June but he started to panic when it had not arrived a week later. It eventually arrived on 26 June. Goldrei said he was “determined that my vote was counted” so he sent it back via DHL at a cost of €45 (£38). “But will others do that?”Peter Moore has been posting his vote from France for 14 years and blamed Brexit for this year’s delays. “Prior to Brexit, a letter between UK and France took two or three days … since Brexit, it now usually takes a week for a letter to arrive.”He is worried there will not be enough time to guarantee the delivery of his vote.Bruce Darrington, who is the chair of the British Overseas Voters Forum and lives in Bangkok, said he feared a high number of postal votes would not reach the UK in time.The group has partnered with Unlock Democracy and New Europeans UK to investigate people’s experiences this year and come up with solutions for the Electoral Commission.“At the moment, thousands of people could be putting their votes into postboxes around the world and thinking ‘job done’,” said Tom Brake, a former Liberal Democrat MP and the director of Unlock Democracy. “But in reality their vote could be arriving in the UK weeks after polls have closed and never be counted.”New Europeans UK and Unlock Democracy have urged the UK to consider setting up “overseas constituencies”, which would allow British people to place their vote in the country they live in. Seventeen countries including France, Italy, Portugal and Romania operate overseas constituencies.Delays have also been reported in Scotland and England. Postal voters constitute more than a fifth of the electorate.Most schools in Scotland broke up for the summer holidays at the end of June and many people who had hoped to vote by post are on holiday. The first minister, John Swinney, said the problem highlighted that no consideration had been made for Scottish term dates when the election was called.Edinburgh city council set up an emergency facility for lost and delayed postal votes at the weekend with a unit providing replacement documentation in the city chambers open from 9am to 5pm each day until the election. Voters are asked to bring photo ID.A spokesperson said it had issued 370 replacements over the weekend. It had originally sent out 103,581 postal packs. Fife council and Glasgow city council have opened similar facilities.Malcolm Burr, the convener of the electoral management board for Scotland, said that for postal voting to be a “viable option” returning officers “must rely on print suppliers and a predictable and reliable service from Royal Mail”.There are also problems in England. The leader of Uttlesford district council in north-west Essex said 2,644 postal ballots went out nine days late owing to “human error” during the oversight of printing.The council said anyone who had not received their ballot pack by Monday should call the council on 01799 510 510 to request a reissue of their ballot paper, which would then be hand-delivered.Those who are worried the delay may mean the ballot will not reach the electoral officers on time can submit the pack by hand at the council offices or at any polling station on election day.Southwark council in London has identified problems with postal votes in the SE22 area. A spokesperson said they had “raised this at a senior level with Royal Mail”, which was confident it would deliver all outstanding ballot packs in time.The Electoral Commission has said it will investigate the problem fully after the election.",Thousands fear they will lose vote in UK election after postal ballot delays,20,8

My thoughts are with our councillor who was hurt and I send him best wishes for a speedy recovery.“We have now sadly taken the decision to instruct my supporters not to display any posters for fear they may also experience violence or intimidation as a result of their support of me.Leila Williams, Conservative parliamentary candidate for East Worthing and Shoreham, has stopped volunteers putting up campaign material following the assault (Image: Leila Williams)“Fear and intimidation should have no place in the politics of East Worthing and Shoreham and indeed across the country.“I call on all my fellow candidates to join me in committing to stamp out this kind of behaviour – the electorate in East Worthing and Shoreham, and our democracy, deserve nothing less.”Sussex Police said they were called to a report of an assault in Upper Brighton Road at around 5pm on Saturday.A force spokesman said: “A man from Sompting reported being threatened by another man before being assaulted and suffering a head injury.“He was taken to hospital for assessment and treatment and has since been discharged.“Following enquiries, a 63-year-old man from Sompting was arrested on suspicion of affray, criminal damage and assault causing actual bodily harm.“He has been released on conditional bail while the investigation continues.“Witnesses or anyone with any information is asked to contact police online or call 101 quoting serial 1030 of 29/06.”",Volunteer assaulted while putting up Conservative campaign posters,20,7

236,"Royal Mail has been criticised by the postal minister for failing to deliver votes in time for the general election.Postal vote delays across the country have forced Royal Mail to scramble to ensure that ballots are counted in time for the general election.Extra staff are being drafted in to work on election night to make sure that ballots are collected from postal sorting offices and reach counts before polls close at 10pm on Thursday.The Telegraph has discovered that voters in more than 90 constituencies, including those of Cabinet ministers, have raised concerns about their ballots failing to arrive.Delayed postal votes can risk some people not being able to cast their ballot if they are not returned on time or if their papers are never received.It is understood that there are several factors behind the delays, including the short turnaround time for councils to process applications, problems with printers and issues with Royal Mail deliveries.The crisis is fuelling fears among candidates that delays may cost them election on Thursday.Voters in more than 90 constituencies have raised concerns about ballot delivery - Toby Melville/ReutersKevin Hollinrake, the postal affairs minister, criticised Royal Mail for failing to anticipate the demand, saying: “We urge Royal Mail to do all they can to make sure that postal votes get to the right people at the right time, and time is completely of the essence now.“There’s a resourcing issue. They have recruited extra people and I welcome that but they’ve got to make sure they’ve got the right number of people to deliver the mail at busy times like this.“It’s not acceptable it’s sat in sorting offices. It needs to be delivered to people’s houses. So they need to put more people on to do that.”He added: “I don’t think there’s an issue here other than Royal Mail being competent and fulfilling their obligations under the USO [Universal Service Obligation].“If people want to choose to vote by post, that’s perfectly fine. In my view, certainly from a logistical point of view, that should be something that’s available to anyone who wants to do that.”Mr Hollinrake said that he had been made aware of problems in his own constituency of Thirsk and Malton, where he is defending a majority of 25,154.Kevin Hollinrake has criticised the postal service after concerns about delays to the delivery of postal votes - Thomas Krych/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockA Royal Mail source said: “We’ll be carrying out sweeps at our mail centres and delivery offices to ensure all postal votes in the network are identified and returned to the relevant local authority before the close of poll stations.“We will also have additional people on the ground in our mail centres on Thursday evening, identifying and pulling postal votes for delivery to local authorities.”One candidate is already warning that the chaos could cost them their chance of winning.Luke Graham, the Conservative candidate in Perth and Kinross-shire, said more than 20 voters had told him they had not received their papers before embarking on their summer holidays.Mr Graham, whose prospective seat was won by the SNP by 21 votes in 2017, said: “It absolutely could be the difference between winning or losing.”The Telegraph has identified at least 91 constituencies where voters are affected, including 76 in England, 12 in Scotland and three in Wales.Kemi Badenoch, Grant Shapps and James Cleverly are among Cabinet ministers whose constituents have raised concerns about postal vote delays.Mr Cleverly, the Home Secretary, said that “some people” in his Essex constituency of Braintree had not yet received their forms.Mr Cleverly, who is defending a majority of 24,673, said it was not clear if the delays were part of a pattern but urged voters to “chase up” any missing ballots.He told The Telegraph: “What I would say to people is that, if they haven’t received their postal ballot, if they’re expecting one, to get in contact with their local authority, to really chase this up.“Everyone should have the right to vote, and people should look to exercise their democratic right.”Completed postal votes must be delivered by 10pm on Thursday, when they will be counted - Ian Forsyth/GettyDowning Street denies that delays will affect resultsDowning Street played down the issue on Monday, with the Prime Minister’s official spokesman saying they were “aware of some concerns” but denying the delays could affect results in marginal seats.An estimated 10 million people are thought to have opted to cast their ballot by post this year, accounting for between 20 and 25 per cent of the vote.Postal voting was introduced for UK elections in 2001, and has increased in popularity from 4.9 per cent to 21 per cent of votes – 6.7 million – in 2019.The deadline to apply to vote by post in Thursday’s poll was June 19. Voters could apply for their postal ballot to be resent to them no more than four days before the election if it had not arrived, and are able to personally hand in their votes at a polling station.If voters have not yet sent their postal ballot, they can take it to a polling station on July 4, although they will be asked for their date of birth, postcode and National Insurance or passport number before they will be able to vote.Those who do not receive ballots in time, or who cannot hand them into a polling station on Thursday, will not be able to cast their vote.There were warnings from senior election officials as early as last year that the electoral system would be unable to cope with increasing demand for postal voting.In a review of the May 2023 local elections, the  Association of Electoral Administrators, which represents returning officers, who are responsible for making sure elections run smoothly, warned about problems with postal votes.Many returning officers were having to deal with delivery problems, the report said, and “significant numbers” of voters had not received their ballots, which caused “upset”.Its chief executive, Peter Stanyon, said: “It’s symptomatic of the challenge of delivering postal votes in a very constrained timetable.“It is getting harder and harder and this time round we are expecting in the region of 10 million postal votes to have been issued for the general election.  That is up by more than 1.5 million on the last time around, which was a winter election.”The Electoral Commission told The Telegraph last week that problems with the postal voting system would be included in its post-election review.Postal votes are counted in the Kingswood by-election earlier this year. Voters can also hand postal votes in to their polling station - Carl Court/GettyAn Electoral Commission spokesman in Scotland confirmed that tens of thousands of postal votes had been delivered to Scottish voters over the weekend. The spokesman continued: “We know local authorities and Royal Mail are working to get the final ones out as soon as possible.”A Royal Mail spokesman said that it has a specialist elections team and that it was working closely with local authorities in order to get ballots to voters in time. They said: “We have no backlog of postal votes. Where concerns have been raised, we have investigated and confirmed ballot packs are being delivered as soon as they arrive in our network.”A Local Government Association spokesman said: “Councils and electoral staff across the country have been doing their utmost to ensure the smooth running of this election and that people can vote.“People voting by post are expected to have increased 20 per cent since the 2019 General elections, with more than 1.3 million postal vote applications made between 22 May and 19 June. This unprecedented increase adds more pressure to an already complex process and overburdened system.“We are aware of reports of incidents where delays have happened. The postal vote system could benefit from review and more could be done to support Royal Mail and printers to be ready to deliver elections.”",Royal Mail criticised for failing to deliver postal votes before election,20,11

So on a Friday – I’ve been doing this for years – I will not do a work-related thing after six o’clock, pretty well come what may.“There are a few exceptions, but that’s what we do.”He added: “In politics, some people think if you fill your diary 24/7 and don’t do anything else, that makes you a much better decision-maker. I don’t agree with that.“I don’t believe in the theory that you’re a better decision-maker if you don’t allow yourself the space to be a dad and have fun with your kids.“Actually, it helps me. It takes me away from the pressure, it relaxes me and I think actually, not only is that what I want to do as a dad, it is better.”A spokesman for the Labour leader said: “Obviously he recognises things will be different if he does end up in No 10.”Asked about the remarks, Rishi Sunak said he had never finished at 6pm and that clocking off so early would not leave enough time to do the job properly.“What I would say is – what time is it now? – I haven’t finished at 6pm ever,” the Prime Minister said on Monday afternoon.“We would only have a couple of hours left in the day at this point, which is not great.”The comments may raise fears of his party’s workers’ rights agenda, under which employees will have a legal right to flexible working.A Conservative Party attack on social media said: “Keir Starmer has said he’d clock off work at 6pm if he became prime minister.“You deserve better than a part-time prime minister. The only way to prevent this is to vote Conservative on Thursday.”Meanwhile, a Tory source told The Sun: “Whether he likes it or not, if he became PM, Sir Sleepy would be required to work after 6pm. If he thinks he can just put his slippers on and make a mug of Horlicks while he tunes into The One Show, then he is in for a shock.”Tory sources have previously called the 61-year-old Labour leader “Sleepy Keir”, suggesting that he cannot keep up with 44-year-old Mr Sunak.Sir Keir says he uses Friday evenings to spend time with his wife, Victoria, and their children - Stefan Rousseau/PA WireThe Labour leader and his wife, Victoria, have a 16-year-old son and a 13-year-old daughter, whom he says are his “pride and joy”.Last week he vowed never to use them in photo opportunities, telling ITV: “This is a very impactful time and that’s why we’re fiercely protective of them and we will continue to be.“So, don’t expect any photos of us with the children or using the children in any way to campaign.”He has also not publicly named them in an attempt to protect their privacy.Sir Keir also suggested his children appeared unimpressed with his political career, saying that after winning a politician of the year award from The Spectator, his son asked: “How did you blag that, then?”Meanwhile, when he was speaking at a fundraising dinner, Sir Keir’s daughter asked: “Why would anyone pay to hear you speak?”“They keep me very, very grounded,” he added.",Starmer suggests he won’t work past 6pm on Fridays,20,11

He was the youngest of three boys, but lost his father at just four years old and then his mother when he was in his mid-teens. She had spent three years battling cancer, during which time he nursed his mother together with his grandmother and brother Henry.Once a keen Scout and Air Scout, he later remembers feeling “isolated” at school because of his caring responsibilities, which meant he couldn’t take part in after-school activities or sports. “The last 18 months she was bedridden and in a lot of pain. I’d spend hours on the bed, talking to her,” he said. Davey was with his mother when she died at Nottingham General Hospital, after being placed on an unsuited dementia ward.After both his parents had died, Davey was brought up by his maternal grandparents in the village of Eakring, though his grandfather died soon after. He spent much of his childhood and young adulthood close to his grandmother. “First of all, she was looking after me.

He has attended special schools but is now educated at home with a tutor – a change that Davey said led to him becoming verbal for the first time. He has spoken about his anxiety about who will care for his son when he and his wife are no longer around. “It’s the thing that worries me more than anything else in my life,” Davey said.Gasson was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in 2012.

80,"It was a defining moment in Marine Le Pen’s painstaking bid to “de-demonise” her party.As the National Rally leader was about to deliver a speech at her party’s traditional May 1 march in 2015, her estranged father took to the stage.She had already banned Jean-Marie Le Pen, the ageing Holocaust denier, from speaking after a fresh salvo of anti-Semitic comments, including that he had never considered France’s wartime collaborationist leader Philippe Petain a traitor and labelling then prime minister Manuel Valls an immigrant due to his Spanish roots.But he defied her and, dressed in red in defiance, stood before the crowd, waving his fists in the air and exclaiming: “I’ve been disowned.”Enough was enough, and he was subsequently booted out of the party altogether.Marine’s cut-throat family purge appears to have spectacularly paid off as her party has reached “the gates of power” after clinching a historic score in Sunday’s first round of snap parliamentary elections.While the RN may yet fall short of an absolute majority in next Sunday’s run-off, the fact that 10.6 million French, or 33 per cent of voters, cast a ballot in her favour is a massive vindication of Ms Le Pen’s attempts to erase its pariah status.“In the space of a few years we’ve gone from being the most hated party in France to the most loved party,” she recently told the Telegraph.The RN won 31 per cent of the vote in the June 9 European elections, far ahead of Emmanuel Macron’s camp on 14.6 per cent, with several polls suggesting her bid to prove she had broken with her party’s xenophobic, anti-Semitic past was gradually bearing fruit.Last year, for the first time since 1984, more French people (45 per cent) than the reverse (41 per cent) said they no longer viewed the RN as a “threat to democracy”, according to a Verian-Epoka survey.“Now, that’s not something you can do by snapping your fingers. I’m not the only one responsible, but come on, maybe I’ll give myself a little credit for this development”, said Ms Le Pen, who has an eye on the presidency in 2027.“I think we’ve done our homework. Does that mean that the political and media system is not yet reticent? Of course it is, but it’s been humming along for 30 years and someone coming along and changing things creates resistance. That’s not a problem, we’re used to it.”During the campaign, political rivals seized on the party’s toxic history to try to mobilise voters against it in the run-up to France’s snap election.Left-wing and centrist politicians reminded voters that when Ms Le Pen’s father co-founded the party – originally named Front National – in 1972, its ranks included former members of a Waffen SS military unit under Nazi command during the Second World War.However, president Macron has previously cautioned against this approach.When Élisabeth Borne, his former prime minister and the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, told a radio station in 2023 that Ms Le Pen’s party were heirs of Pétain, he warned that “history and morality” were no longer effective in countering its apparently inexorable rise.“You will never make millions of people who have voted for the ‘far-Right’ believe they are fascists,” Mr Macron reportedly told ministers, suggesting that gunning for its policies, not its past was the best way to bring it down.That past is undoubtedly racist and anti-Semitic. Mr Le Pen, a former paratrooper who had served in Algeria, once founded a company that sold recordings of Nazi speeches and German military songs.In 1987, he famously dubbed the Holocaust a “mere detail” of the Second World War and was subsequently convicted of hate speech and contesting crimes against humanity.‘Unabashed racist’An unabashed racist, in 1996, he said he believed in the “inequality of the races” and that ebola was a blessing for Africa as it would result in fewer migrants coming to Europe.When, in 2002, he shocked France by making the second round of the presidential election, it sparked mass street demonstrations. His rival, Jacques Chirac, won with more than 82 per cent of the vote.When Ms Le Pen, Jean-Marie Le Pen’s youngest daughter, took over the anti-immigration party in 2011, she ousted many of its most extreme elements and toned down its language, framing it as a governing rather than protest party.She then ousted her father from the party, saying his outbursts were “political suicide”.In 2018, she changed the party’s name to National Rally and took a case to France’s highest administrative court, the Council of State, arguing that it should no longer be labelled “far-Right” by the interior ministry. The case was dismissed and France officially classifies the party as far-Right.However, heated debate erupted during this campaign over whether the term was still appropriate.David Pujadas, a well-known anchorman on rolling news channel LCI, said he thought it wasn’t.“Studying the far Right in Europe, I saw what Geert Wilders was proposing in the Netherlands, what the AfD was proposing in Germany... And I saw the gulf that separated these parties from the RN,” he told Le Quotidien. “So here, it’s the far Right and elsewhere it’s the far far Right? That’s why I changed.”In that case, ex-Trotskyist Jean-Luc Mélenchon and his France Unbowed party should be dubbed “far Left”, said RMC colleague Apolline de Malherbe, even if the Council of State does not use that term for that party.Perhaps Ms Le Pen’s main weapon in her detoxification drive is Jordan Bardella, the 28-year-old party leader who hopes to become France’s next prime minister after the run-off on Sunday.With his Colgate smile, ideal son-in-law good looks and taste for TikTok and selfies, Mr Bardella has brought in a new generation of supporters with a consensual image.However, both he and Ms Le Pen have kept the party’s essential doctrine, namely “national preference”, and which she has rechristened “national priority”. In other words, French citizens should be given priority over non-nationals for jobs, social welfare assistance and housing.Rights groups and constitutionalists say the doctrine is discriminatory and anti-constitutional.A key plank of its manifesto is to end birthright citizenship, namely the right for children born to foreign parents on French soil, who are raised and schooled in France, to later claim French nationality.But experts point out that eliminating birthright citizenship could encounter constitutional hurdles.His party also shocked many during the campaign by expressing its intention to ban dual nationals from taking up sensitive posts, which would have barred a former education minister and various diplomats from keeping their jobs. France has three million dual nationals and the mooted measure caused uproar.The party has also kept its long-running hard line on law and order, arguing that crime is linked to immigration. Ms Le Pen wants to introduce a presumption of “legitimate defence” for police officers firing weapons.De-demonising the partyMr Bardella has pledged to fight a “cultural battle” against Islamism, to demand a €2 billion (£1.7 billion) rebate from the European Union, drastically reduce legal and illegal immigration and deport foreign criminals if he leads the government.Speaking to the Telegraph recently, he said: “We’ve been de-demonising the party for 10 years. Now I want to institutionalise it.”That he said had been done by the 88 MPs from his party forming the largest single-party opposition force in the previous parliament. In what has been dubbed “the tie strategy”, they were ordered to look the part and avoid any controversial rhetoric to show they were ready to take the levers of power.“We’ve changed dimension. We are the most serious group in the National Assembly,” he claimed. Meanwhile, the national cursor had moved to the Right on most of the issues it had been defending for years.By contrast with the RN, the Left has wreaked chaos in parliament, flouting basic rules by, for example, brandishing Palestinian flags in the National Assembly and blocking debates.But economically, the RN is, if anything, far-Left, proposing to cut the retirement age to 60 for some, slash VAT on energy prices and block the price of essential goods, even if it toned down some of these during the campaign to avoid scaring the markets.National Rally expert Jean-Yves Camus said that it resembled other European “illiberal” parties found in Hungary with Victor Orban or in Poland’s Law and Justice party that “undermine the system of checks and balances that is characteristic of democracy”. It is also historically pro-Putin, seen as a strong hand who defends traditional values and Christian roots, but has rowed back since the Ukraine war.He said perhaps the main reasons the RN had become more palatable was the state of the other parties, which were either in ruins or had radicalised, making the Le Pen camp appear more mainstream.“First, we have a president who wanted to play poker and lost, never had a real political party to act as a conveyor belt for his ideas and is now paying for the fact that he wanted to establish a quasi-vertical link with the French people and failed,” he told the Telegraph.“Second, France is probably the only major country in Europe without a conservative Right.”The once-mighty Gaullist Republicans, which won 10 per cent of the vote, are deeply divided after a spectacular split over whether ot not to back Ms Le Pen.Ms Le Pen has benefited from the xenophobic, anti-Islamic outbursts of Eric Zemmour, a polemist whose rhetoric makes her look like a shrinking violet, and has distanced herself from Germany’s far-Right AfD.Last month, she said her party would no longer sit in the EU parliament with the AfD after the head of its European election list said that someone who had been a member of the SS was “not automatically a criminal”.By contrast, she has sought to build bridges with Giorgia Melona, the Italian prime minister, who on Monday said that attempts to “demonise” far-Right voters were losing impact.“I notice something that in different forms is also happening in Italy: the constant attempt to demonise and corner the people who don’t vote for the Left,” said the most Right-wing Italian leader since the Second World War.“It’s a trick that serves to escape debating on the merits of different political proposals. But it’s a trick that fewer and fewer people fall for. We’ve seen it in Italy, and we’re seeing it more and more in Europe and throughout the West”.But above all, said Mr Camus, Ms Le Pen’s ranks had swollen due to the mass rejection of the fiery Jean-Luc Mélenchon, an admirer of Hugo Chavez and Mao Zedong, whose Unbowed France, LFI, is part of the New Popular Front, which came second on Sunday.“No doubt on Sunday, moderate voters, even social democrat voters, will find it very difficult to put a Popular Front ballot paper in the box due to his outbursts.”This explains why Mr Bardella is so keen to debate with Mr Mélenchon rather than a more moderate member of the Left-wing alliance.Beyond his tepid support for Ukraine and refusal to call Hamas a terrorist organisation after the Oct 7 attack on Israel, Mr Mélenchon has been accused of downplaying anti-Semitic incidents and pandering to the radical Muslim vote.“It reminds me a lot of George Galloway in the UK whose Respect Party tried to bring about this sort of fusion between political Islam and the far Left. It worked quite well but is a turn-off for most,” he said.As parties jockey to forge alliances and strategies to keep the RN out, Sunday will be the ultimate crash test of whether the de-demonisation drive is complete.Supporters upbeatMeanwhile, its supporters have the wind in their sails and are prepared to forget Mr Bardella’s decision to dilute some of his policies.Shortly after the results were announced at Ms Le Pen’s northern fiefdom of Hénin-Beaumont, one said: “He’s reasonable, in fact he does what other parties fail to do, which is not to offer promises he cannot keep. We won’t be able to do everything straight away.”Then the subject moved onto immigration and the tone became more radical.One supporter called Vanessa said: “We need to bin immigration. We don’t have the same culture, we don’t have the same values. They want to try and change us. Never. I’d rather die. With the Popular Front, we’ll end up under under Sharia law. No way.”Edouard was even more direct. “I’ve had enough of the Left that doles out lessons to everyone. If they love migrants that much, they can have them in their block of flats. They have houses, a job and cars. Why are they in my social housing and whites sleep on the sidewalk?”Minutes earlier, Ms Le Pen had taken to the stage to call on the French to vote National Rally to “finally get back unity and fraternity”.",Marine Le Pen: How the National Rally leader redefined the party ahead of the French election,20,11
103,"Keir Starmer has said that a government in France led by Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) party would not hamper a Labour government’s intention to negotiate a better EU deal.The RN made historic gains in the first round of France’s snap elections on Sunday with 33% of the vote, bringing the possibility the party could emerge as the largest in the final round of voting next Sunday.The Labour leader was asked if he was concerned that a victory for Le Pen would hamper his ability to gain closer economic ties with the EU if he becomes prime minister.“I genuinely don’t want to get ahead of myself. Firstly, we haven’t seen the final outcome in France, we’ve also got a big outcome of our own on Thursday, so we need those two pieces to fall into place and to be clear, I don’t think it affects the overall intention that we have, which is to negotiate a better deal with the EU,” he said.“I think the deal we’ve got is botched, I think that anyone who does business with the EU feels that it’s botched and that we could do better than that, across not just trade but research and development, and also on the security front.”While Starmer has ruled out radically reforming Britain’s ties with the EU, he has said a Labour government would “reset” its relationship with the EU, with members of his top team including David Lammy, Jonathan Reynolds and the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, saying it would be in the country’s “national interest”.He stressed he was willing to “work with any government in Europe and across the world”.He added: “For me, that’s what serious government is about. So yes, we will work with whoever.“I do think it is important that we make the progressive case to meet the challenges that we face across Europe and across the world. And that’s why Thursday and the general election here is so important, because I think that only progressive answers will actually make a material difference to the challenges that we’re facing.”Le Pen has a preference for bilateral deals over EU-wide ones. Starmer said: “I’ve always supported bilaterals as well as EU-wide agreements. They’re not mutually exclusive.“And some of the agreements we’ve got with France are bilateral in any event. I think they need to be stronger and better and deeper, particularly in relation to smashing the gangs that are running the vile trade of putting people into boats.”Starmer was speaking to reporters in the constituency of Buckingham and Bletchley on the second stop of his tour through formerly safe rural Conservative heartlands, having first visited Hitchen before heading to Banbury in Oxfordshire where the Tory cabinet minister Victoria Prentis hopes to hold her seat.He said the rise of nationalism meant that Labour had to “address the everyday concerns of so many people in this country who feel disaffected by politics”.Starmer did dodge questions over whether he would meet the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, if he were to become prime minister, dismissing it as “simply not an issue” at the moment.Rishi Sunak criticised Starmer for failing to match the Conservative’s pledge to increase defence spending, a pledge made only after former ministers spoke out about the need for it.“It sends a bad signal to our adversaries, like Putin, that we’re not serious about investing in our security, that we don’t have the staying power to stand up to him,” Sunak told Times Radio.Reform UK announced a £1m advertising splurge in the final days of the campaign, claiming it had been “flooded” with £400,000 of donations in 24 hours, and that the party’s membership had doubled from 30,000 to 60,000 in the last month.",Starmer says far-right win in France would not stop Labour trying to forge better EU deal,20,8

Oo arr, it be possible alright: Chippy, as they call it, is in fact a former mill town and has been attached to the redrawn Banbury constituency, turning Victoria Prentis’s 17,000 majority into a marginal.

Keir patted the dear man on the shoulder. Chin up. This time next week, he could be foreign secretary.“It’s time for change!” shouted Rachel in her Supreme Dalek voice, stopping short at “resistance is futile” (the media training is paying off). Keir promised us a “summer of change”, adding that Labour has “a smile in our face and a spring in our step”.

If they crush dissent in the Labour Party, which they’ve been very good at doing then they actually give themselves a fool’s paradise of agreement and they have driven the other people out, who are actually very constructive.”The criticism comes after the once-party colleagues fell out after Mr Corbyn was kicked out of the party.Sir Keir previously claimed he was “certain” his predecessor was going to lose the 2019 election.Britain Landmark Elections 1997 (AP1997)Tory MP who used Nigel Farage on campaign leaflet falls out spectacularly with Reform15:32 , Salma OuaguiraA Brexiteer Tory MP who used a picture of Nigel Farage on her campaign leaflet has fallen out spectacularly with his party Reform UK, David Maddox reports.Andrea Jenkyns claimed she was wooed by a pro-Brexit businessman acting on behalf of Reform who she says offered her jobs to defect.The MP has described a number of meetings with Arron Banks - including going to Nigel Farage’s birthday party as his plus 1 - as Reform under Richard Tice’s leadership tried to pressure her to switch parties ahead of the election.But the meetings prompted fevered speculation before the election that Ms Jenkyns might defect to Reform and led to revelations of her efforts to strike a deal between them and the Tories.Ms Jenkyn’s allegations have been denied by Reform and Mr Banks, but the row has echoes of claims made by Lee Anderson, denied by Tice and Reform, that he was offered £80,000 a year to defect before he was suspended by the Tories. Another Tory MP has made the same allegation but does not want to be named.You can read The Independent’s full story hereStarmer: I will work with Marine Le Pen on small boats15:22 , Salma OuaguiraSir Keir Starmer has admitted he would work with right-wing French politician Marine Le Pen to deal with the small boats crossing the Channel.Speaking in Buckinghamshire, the Labour leader said: “I will work with any government in Europe and across the world if we are elected in to serve the country.“For me, that’s what serious government is about. So yes, we will work with whoever.“I do think it is important that we make the progressive case to meet the challenges that we face across Europe and across the world.”The comments come after Sir Keir claimed the only capable of beating the far right in Europe is the Left.Ms Le Pen’s National Rally party won the first round of France’s parliamentary election on Sunday.Tories accused of ‘hollowing out’ defence as historic regiments culled15:14 , Salma OuaguiraTories accused of ‘hollowing out’ Britain’s defence as historic regiments culledRory Stewart warns Tories ‘not to try Le Pen' at home15:08 , Salma OuaguiraRory Stewart has warned the Conservatives not to replicate Marine Le Pen’s “populism”.The former One Nation MP and cabinet minister said the Tories cannot resurface from the defeating opinion polls by “appealing to the populist right”.Instead, he urged the party to “retake the centre”.Declaring that he would not vote for Labour, he told Times Radio: “The fantasy seems to be that if they bring in nice, good-willed people from difficult backgrounds, everything’s going to be fine.“I don’t feel that they have yet taken on board just how difficult government is. So I’m very, very worried that this is going to be a very stale, inactive government that’s going to be using class warfare as a cover for inaction.”Starmer dismisses questions about working with Putin if elected15:00 , Salma OuaguiraSir Keir Starmer has dismissed questions on whether he would meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin if he were to become prime minister.Speaking during a campaign visit to Buckingham and Bletchley, the Labour leader told reporters: “Look at the moment that is simply not an issue. He is the aggressor in Ukraine, and the most important thing is to be absolutely clear that our support for Ukraine is on a united front in this country.“And the current Government and us as the Opposition have spoken with one voice since the outbreak of this conflict. That was a deliberate decision that I took.“I’ve been to see President Zelensky in Kyiv myself personally to say, should there be a change of government, there won’t be any change in our support for Ukraine.”He continued: “Without getting ahead of ourselves, obviously, an important event next week is the Nato summit in Washington, where one of the big issues will be the continued support for Ukraine.” (Stefan Rousseau/PA Wire)Farage: Marine Le Pen’s win in France would be a ‘disaster’14:52 , Salma OuaguiraWith Marine Le Pen’s party at the gates of power in the polls, UK politicians have reacted to the possibility of having a right-wing French government as the new neighbours.Sir Keir Starmer said this morning that only the Left can beat rising far right parties across Europe, and Rishi Sunak dodged questions about a potential victory.But Nigel Farage hasn’t hold back. The Reform UK leader said a victory for the National Rally would be “a disaster” for France.He told UnHeard that the party would be “even worse for the economy than the current lot”.It comes as Mr Farage previously expressed support for Le Pen claiming she is a “sincere Eurosceptic”.Join today’s Q&A with Reform UK candidate Howard Cox14:50 , Jabed AhmedThe Independent is giving readers the chance to chat directly with candidates from some of the major political parties in a special general election series of Ask Me Anything events.Today’s Q&A session starts at 6pm and is with Reform UK candidate Howard Cox.Two of Reform’s core five pledges are to do with migration. The party says it would freeze non-essential immigration, but concedes there would be exceptions with work in healthcare considered essential.Elsewhere, the party pledges big tax cuts for small businesses, an overhaul of the adult social care system, scrapping the net zero target, banning ‘transgender ideology’ in schools, and axing the rest of the HS2 rail link.If you have a question for Mr Cox submit it now.Find out more here.Politics Explained | Why does talk of a Labour landslide worry Keir Starmer?14:40 , Jabed AhmedWith just days to go before voting opens in the general election, the Labour Party held a pre-election event in London on Saturday night. Kate Devlin explains why it was so muted.She writes: “The Labour leader knows the opinion poll shows power is within his grasp. Forecasts suggest he could even make history with the largest ever Labour majority in parliament – winning by even more than Tony Blair achieved with his 1997 landslide.“Yet the event had an air of deliberate caution, tempered by fears of comparisons with 1992 and that the feeling a Labour government is already guaranteed will see the party leak votes to the Lib Dems and the Greens.”Read more

Thursday.The party said it was “flooded” with £400,000 of donations in 24 hours, and that in the month of the General Election campaign the party’s membership had doubled from 30,000 to 60,000.Reform claims the donations came from “grass-roots” support spurred on by the party’s event held in Birmingham at the weekend, despite last week’s allegations of racism as a result of comments emerging from the Clacton division of the campaign.The £1 million advertising campaign across national newspapers and websites will seek to drive home the message that only Reform UK will be able to mount an effective opposition to a Labour government.Party leader Nigel Farage said he was “blown away by the generosity of so many ordinary people who are sick of what is happening to this country”.Over the past week Mr Farage has faced accusations from across the political divide of failing to tackle allegations of racism within Reform which have engulfed the party.Exclusive: Windrush pensioner facing

Reed has warned the Conservatives could still “sneak through at the end” to win the general election.With just three days until the general election, the shadow environment secretary claimed it is still all to play for, despite Labour leading on the opinion polls.Mr Reed told the BBC’s Politics Live: “The election isn’t over, like a football match, until the whistle blows and the whistle blows on the election at 10 o’clock on Thursday the 4th. So until that point we do not know the result and anyone that claims this is over, we know the result, it’s all been won, absolute rubbish.“Until people go out there and cast their votes, we do not have a decision on the general election and we won’t know until the end of Thursday.“The votes haven’t yet been cast. I’ve sat around for plenty of general elections hoping Labour’s going to win and seen the Tories sneak through at the end. Just to draw level with the Conservatives, Labour needs the biggest swing that any party’s had since the end of the Second World War.”Sunak accuses Farage of not doing enough to tackle racism allegations13:17 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak has accused Nigel Farage of not doing enough to tackle allegations of racism within Reform.It comes as party activist was caught describing the prime minister by using a racial slur by Channel 4.The party leader condemned the comments and dropped the campaigners involved in the row as a result.But Mr Sunak said Mr Farage still has “questions to answer” and criticised the leader for the “culture within the party”.The PM told reporters in Staffordshire: “I’ve made my views on that pretty clear, and I said he’s got some questions to answer. And I think he described the comments as inappropriate last time I heard. They weren’t inappropriate. They were racist and appalling.“And the person who made them has apologised to Reform for the impact it’s had on them.“And as I said, you’ve got now multiple Reform candidates and campaigners openly espousing racist and misogynistic views, seemingly without challenge, tells you something about the culture within the Reform Party.”Sunak says he is proud of disastrous election campaign - and claims he will win13:10 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak says he is proud of disastrous election campaign - and claims he will winJoin our virtual event examining the election results13:00 , Salma OuaguiraOur expert panel will be analysing the major triumphs, biggest setbacks and key outcomes for each of the UK’s major political parties.Hosted by our chief political commentator John Rentoul, this event will also offer a deep dive into the immediate and long-term challenges facing the newly elected government, including immigration, the cost of living, the NHS, education, Brexit and more.Our panel includes The Independent’s own Andrew Grice, a political columnist and former political editor from 1998 to 2015.

But fast forward to 2024 and not only is Mr Corbyn not Labour leader, he is no longer a member of the party he championed for 40 years, and is instead running as an independent.Unfortunately for the man who has served Islington North since 1983, not all of his supporters appear to know that, and that could at least partly explain why the veteran campaigner appears to have a real fight on his hands despite winning a majority of 26,000 in 2019.You can read The Independent’s full story hereThen Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn (right) alongside shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer during a press conference in central London in 2019 Jonathan Brady/PA) (PA Archive)12:24 , Salma OuaguiraSwinney: ‘Nothing that can be done’ about delayed postal votes in Scotland12:16 , Salma OuaguiraScotland’s first minister John Swinney has said there is “nothing that can be done” about delays in postal votes across Scotland.The SNP leader said there had been various reports of people not receiving their vote ahead of polling day.And the Electoral Management Board for Scotland said there had been “many difficulties experienced with the delivery of postal votes” across the country.But Mr Swinney said: “Unfortunately, there is nothing that can be done. There are no other proxy arrangements that can be put in place, but I think it’s illustrative of the fact that there was no thought given to summer school holidays.”Sunak urges voters to stop a Labour ‘supermajority'12:07 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak has warned voters against a “Labour supermajority” on Thursday.Speaking from Staffordshire, the prime minister said:“But when you go to the polls on Thursday you have to remember this is not a by-election. This is a choice about who governs our country for years and I would urge you not to sleepwalk into that, think about what that will mean for you and your family and the impact that’ll have.“In particular, if these polls are right, and Labour are in power with a supermajority, you have to think about what that will mean – a Labour government unchecked, no-one to hold them accountable, no-one to stand up to them in Parliament and all of the impact it would have on all of your lives.”Watch: Cheaper to put asylum seekers up in Ritz than Rwanda plan, Labour says11:52 , Salma OuaguiraCheaper to put asylum seekers up in Ritz than Rwanda plan, Labour saysPM urges voters don’t give Labour ‘a blank cheque’11:36 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak has warned voters backing Labour would mean handing Sir Keir Starmer a “blank cheque”.He said: “I tell you this: once you have handed Keir Starmer and Labour a blank cheque, you won’t be able to get it back.”The prime minister added Labour will scrap the Tory plan to fly asylum seekers to Rwanda, adding the opposition has “no answers on securing borders and immigration”.",General election latest: Rishi Sunak won’t confirm whether he’ll quit as leader if Conservative Party loses,20,9
240,"Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says if even one person is disenfranchised due to postal voting delays it is “one too many”.He became the latest political leader to voice concerns about problems caused by voters not receiving their postal ballots when they expected.As the Scottish school holidays have now begun, a number of councils have set up emergency stations where people can be re-issued with their postal ballots.Over the weekend, SNP leader John Swinney and Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey also said they are worried about voters missing out due to not receiving postal ballots before they fly off on holiday.Mr Sarwar was asked about the issue as he spoke to journalists on a visit to the fabrication halls at Harland and Wolff’s yard in Methil, Fife.He said: “I’m deeply concerned across the board, because one person disenfranchised is one person too many, regardless of their politics, regardless of who they vote for, because that’s the fundamentals of our democracy.“And I’m aware of several cases already of people who have left to go on holiday and didn’t receive their postal votes on time. That is not acceptable.”The Scottish Labour leader said it is important to “minimise any damage done”, and called on the Electoral Commission, election management boards and the Royal Mail to urgently address the issue.He also said councils should take a “consistent” approach to setting up the emergency postal vote stations to avoid any confusion.This election is our chance to deliver jobs, investment and growth to Scotland.Delighted to visit Harland & Wolff in Methil today with @Baker4Lab and @IanMurrayMP. pic.twitter.com/2lVM1u23ME— Anas Sarwar (@AnasSarwar) July 1, 2024At the weekend, Mr Swinney said there appeared to have been little consideration given to the issue of Scotland’s summer school holidays.If voters are overseas on polling day before they have cast their postal ballot, they will not be able to vote, he said.Speaking to Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips on Sky News, Mr Swinney said: “Unfortunately, there is nothing that can be done.“They have to be here to be able to exercise their postal vote, if it’s been delivered to the house, or if there is an alternative arrangement in place.“There are no other proxy arrangements that can be put in place, but I think it’s illustrative of the fact there was no thought given to summer school holidays.”",‘One person disenfranchised is one too many’ – Sarwar on postal vote delays,20,4
314,"The SNP will face its first national election on Thursday since Nicola Sturgeon stood down as SNP leader in March 2023.The Scottish Nationalists won 48 of Scotland’s Westminster seats in the 2019 election but polls suggest they are on course to lose at least half at the general election thanks to a combination of a resurgent Labour Party, the Scottish Government’s unpopularity and a series of scandals, including a long-running police investigation into the party’s finances.John Swinney, who replaced the disastrous Humza Yousaf as SNP leader and First Minister, has attempted to paper over some of the party’s yawning divisions in his manifesto, which he launched at a campaign event in Edinburgh on June 19.However, the party document was thin and amounted to only 32 pages, three of which are completely blank.There was also no breakdown of costs for a litany of what appear to be expensive commitments on welfare and NHS spending.Mr Swinney was not a success in his first stint as SNP leader – between 2000 and 2004 – when he was ousted after overseeing two poor election results. Although a more seasoned politician now, he lacks the popular appeal of Ms Sturgeon.So far in the election campaign, the future of North Sea oil and gas has been a major issue in Scotland, with a succession of SNP figures struggling to give a clear answer on the new drilling.Mr Swinney himself has come under pressure over the SNP’s handling of devolved policy areas, such as education and health.Despite these being run from Holyrood, there is evidence that many Scottish voters are becoming increasingly disillusioned with the state of schools and the health service.Read the latest election pollsFollow The Telegraph’s general election live coverageHere is a look at what the SNP has promised in its 32-page pledge and what this may mean for Mr Swinney’s chances on July 4.IndependenceTax and spendingHealth and social careWelfareDefence and foreign affairsEuropean UnionImmigrationEnergy and environmentJohn Swinney with his party's 2024 manifesto at the SNP launch in Edinburgh on June 19 - Jeff J MitchellIndependence“Deliver independence” in ScotlandBegin immediate negotiations with the UK GovernmentDevolve new powers to HolyroodSupport abolition of House of LordsAs had been promised, independence is emblazoned on “page one, line one” of the party’s manifesto, which states: “Vote SNP for Scotland to become an independent country.”However, while it asserts that the SNP can “deliver independence”, the document sheds very little light on how this could be achieved in practice.The SNP manifesto states that the devolved government in Edinburgh would be “empowered to begin immediate negotiations with the UK Government to give democratic effect to Scotland becoming an independent country” should the SNP win a majority of Scottish seats.Mr Swinney has said his preferred route to independence would be a referendum, though any calls for this would be certainly rejected by the UK Government, whether led by Sir Keir Starmer or Rishi Sunak.Interestingly, the manifesto emphasises what the SNP claims is an existing mandate for independence from the last Holyrood elections, saying it is “more important than ever for the mandate won in 2021 to be respected”.Pressed by journalists, Mr Swinney repeatedly refused to concede that his party would lose its claimed independence mandate should it fail to win a majority of Scottish seats.The manifesto attempts on multiple occasions to link independence to what polls suggest Scottish voters generally consider more pressing issues, such as the economy, NHS and the cost of living.Other constitutional policies include the devolution of a swathe of new powers to Holyrood and to support the abolition of the House of Lords.Tax and spending“Full devolution” of tax powers to HolyroodEndorse windfall taxes on Scottish businessesSupport Labour’s VAT raid on private schoolsThe SNP have hiked income taxes on everyone earning over £28,000 in Scotland, but would like to go further according to its manifesto.The party is demanding the “full devolution” of tax powers to Holyrood so that more cash can be raised.Mr Swinney said the SNP could “ensure rates and thresholds fit our progressive income tax rates” with the devolution of National Insurance.It also appears to be endorsing a series of windfall taxes on Scottish businesses, claiming powers to impose them would “tackle the twin crises of cost of living and climate change while meeting the specific needs of Scotland”.The party has also backed Labour’s proposal to impose VAT on private schools.Find out how Sir Keir Starmer’s manifesto comparesCurrent fiscal rules would be scrapped under the SNP and replaced with a new set of guidelines allowing more investment in public services.However, the lack of cost details means it is hard to say how these promises would be paid for.Health and social careDemand an extra £10bn for Scottish NHSEnd health service privatisationIncrease NHS pay by at least £6bnThe SNP has demanded that the UK Government pumps an extra £10 billion annually into the NHS, claiming this would “address rampant inflationary pressures and improve performance”.In addition, the party wants the UK Government to match the more generous pay deals Holyrood has agreed with NHS workers to prevent strikes, but is now causing it financial difficulties.This would cost a further £6 billion across the UK and result in a total boost to the Scottish Government’s budget of £1.6 billion.The party is also saying it would introduce a “keep the NHS in public hands bill” to protect the health service.Despite being fully devolved, the SNP has begun warning that only a vote for the nationalists will protect the NHS from privatisation.Opponents have seen this as a sign of desperation from the SNP, particularly as waiting times in Scotland have spiralled to record levels and performance is deteriorating.WelfareScrap two child benefit capOffer free food and energy to low-income groupsDemand full compensation for WASPI womenAt his manifesto launch, Mr Swinney repeatedly attacked Labour over its refusal to promise to scrap the two child benefit cap introduced in 2017.The SNP manifesto says the policy has caused “unnecessary suffering” and must go.While the party has not included costs in its manifesto, independent researchers have estimated that scrapping the policy, which limits benefit payments to two children in a household, would cost £3.4 billion per year.The manifesto also appears to include a vague commitment to effectively offering free food and energy for low-income groups.It backs legislation introducing an “essentials guarantee” to ensure “everyone can afford basic necessities like food and utilities”.The SNP is also demanding “full, fast and fair compensation” for WASPI women, who claim they were wrongly disadvantaged over pension changes.John Swinney campaigning with Edinburgh South West candidate Joanna Cherry on June 12 - Jane BarlowDefence and foreign affairsScrap Trident nuclear deterrentRecognise Palestinian stateIncrease international aid budgetRaise minimum military age to 18The SNP’s flagship defence policy is to scrap the Trident nuclear deterrent.It says the money saved from retiring Britain’s nuclear submarines could instead be spent on “conventional defence and public services”.The party also wants the UK to demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and immediately recognise Palestine as a state.The UK’s international aid budget should be increased to 0.7 per cent, according to the SNP, while the minimum age for joining the UK military should be raised to 18.The party does not put forward a policy on what proportion of GDP should be spent on defence, against the NATO target of 2 per cent.European UnionRe-enter the single marketRestore free movement for EU citizensRejoin the EU following as independent stateThe SNP wants to “reverse the damage of Brexit and re-enter the single market restoring free movement for EU citizens”.However, it appears to concede that the UK will not be rejoining the EU, instead emphasising a “vision for an independent Scotland in the EU”.The manifesto states that Brexit has been a “disaster” for Scotland and wiped billions from the Scottish economy.But, there is no detail about how Scotland would meet membership requirements even if Scotland were to achieve independence.Scottish civil servants have estimated that it could take nearly a decade for a Scottish state to gain entry, from the point of leaving the UK, in what would be a lengthy and highly complex process.There is also nothing about how trade barriers would be created with the rest of the UK – by far Scotland’s largest market – or inevitable border checks would be overcome.ImmigrationReturn of free movement from the EUPowers to issue work permits to foreignersIntroduce post-study and family visasMore welcome regime for asylum seekersScotland’s working age population is expected to shrink over the coming decades, creating a demographic timebomb with fewer working people to pay for services for a larger number of elderly pensioners.The SNP favours a much more liberal immigration policy than the UK Government, including the return of free movement from the EU.It also wants Holyrood to have powers to issue work permits to foreigners, based on the distinctive needs of the Scottish economy. New working visas, five-year post-study visas and family visas with much lower barriers than the UK currently uses would be introduced.The SNP has called for a much more welcome regime for asylum seekers and his government has argued that an independent Scotland would allow them to work and claim benefits.Energy and environmentIntroduce climate compatibility assessments on fossil fuelsBring in climate reparationsInvest £28bn in green economyThe 2024 manifesto does not restate the SNP government’s existing position that there should be a “presumption” against new oil and gas developments in the North Sea.However, it does not fully endorse them either, instead saying there should be an “evidence based approach to oil and gas”.Any further extraction of fossil fuels must only go ahead following a “robust climate compatibility assessment”, though there is no detail on what this would entail.The SNP wants Labour to resurrect its abandoned plan to invest at least £28 billion a year in the green economy and Mr Swinney’s party rules out any new nuclear power plants in Scotland.The manifesto endorses the idea of climate reparations and calls for more investment in “loss and damage”.This is where richer countries, who have historically emitted the most greenhouse gases, make payments to developing countries hit by climate change.It demands that “the UK Government must provide a new contribution to the new Loss and Damage Fund which is truly additional to existing commitments”.Can you vote for the SNP in England?The SNP have only ever fielded candidates in Scotland and will not be contesting any seats in England or Wales.Standing candidates outside of Scotland runs counter to the party’s central aim of negotiating another independence referendum.",SNP manifesto 2024: John Swinney’s election policies at a glance,21,11

However, he also suggested that she could be a “a disaster” for France.Connections between the two had previously been made because of their shared views on immigration, both expressing criticism of the west over the war in Ukraine and their similar views on the culture war issues.Ms Le Pen is also believed to have looked at Ukip as a means of remodelling her party from its fascist past to a rightwing nationalist one.However, there are differences with Mr Farage taking a much more libertarian view to economic policy in particular.Le Pen’s party has topped the poll in France (REUTERS)And Mr Straw and Sir Malcolm insisted that the differences do not stop there. Neither expect Reform to perform a similar surge as RN because of crucial differences between the parties - not least because they believe Farage is “a one man show”.Sir Malcolm, who was John Major’s foreign secretary between 1995 and 1997, said: “They are not remotely comparable. Le Pen leads a major party, with a clear ideological identity and many years of growing popular support.“Farage has his own opinions and has some popularity as a campaigner. It is by no means clear if he will even win his own seat in Clacton.“His main objective is to damage the Tories by syphoning of votes that will help Labour win more MPs. He may or may not inflict real damage but he remains an individual not a cause.”Meanwhile, Mr Straw, who served as Labour’s foreign secretary from 2001 to 2006, argued that both Le Pen and Farage provided good reasons not to have a proportional representation electoral system.Former foreign secretary Jack Straw (Getty Images)He said: “I follow French politics as closely as I can. The RN did do very well in the first round but if the left alliance (Nouveau Front populaire) does withdraw in constituencies where it has come third, and Macron's Ensemble does likewise my guess is that the left and centre should win more seats together than the RN, but the RN are now plainly established as a very serious force in French politics.“For all sorts of reasons the RN is much better established than is Farage's lot. It's partly the voting system but partly because thanks to Brexit and Johnson's decision to expel many good One Nation Tories from their party in 2019 the far right rump inside the Tory Party is so much larger than it was - and Sunak has lacked the ability to control it.“Also British society is not so riven as is French in my view. But don't forget that the French voting system is ultimately a first-past-the-post system in the final ballot. If either France or the UK had a PR system God knows where we'd be - except in a mess.”","Farage not as dangerous as Le Pen because he is a one man act, Straw and Rifkind claim",21,9

He did not register the visit until May 5.He also declared four tickets for Arsenal versus Watford on March 6, 2022, two months after the game, and also declared tickets for his staff for the British Kebab Awards once the deadline had passed.",Starmer accepted £76k worth of gifts including football and concert tickets,21,11

74,"If the polls are to be believed, the Tories are in for a historic defeat on Thursday.A major survey for The Telegraph this month put the Conservatives on just 53 seats, with high-profile casualties predicted to include Penny Mordaunt, Jeremy Hunt, James Cleverly, and Rishi Sunak himself.Even with a result half as bad as that prediction, it is likely Mr Sunak would resign, or face an imminent leadership challenge.Here, The Telegraph takes a look at some of the potential contenders to replace him.Business Secretary, North West EssexAlso minister for women and equalities, Mrs Badenoch is the current bookies’ favourite to be the next Tory leader. She also had the highest net satisfaction rating of any Cabinet minister among readers of the influential ConservativeHome website in May. She came fourth in the contest to succeed Boris Johnson in July 2022, and has hinted at a potential Tory leadership run after the election. She may be well placed in Westminster, given that Savanta’s bombshell MRP poll for The Telegraph forecast she would be the only “big beast” left standing after polling day.Leader of the House of Commons, Portsmouth NorthPenny Mordaunt came third in the 2022 leadership contest, and boosted her popularity and her name recognition with her prominent ceremonial role at last year’s Coronation. She was the third most popular Cabinet minister among ConservativeHome readers in May. However, if the Savanta projection is correct, she is on track to lose her seat to Labour on July 4.Former Home Secretary, Fareham and WaterloovilleDespite remaining popular with the Tory base, who admired her tough stance on illegal migration, Ms Braverman might struggle to beat Mrs Badenoch for the support of the Right of the party, having made an early exit in the 2022 leadership race. The Savanta poll also suggests she is set to lose her seat to Labour at the general election.Home Secretary, BraintreeHaving served as education secretary, foreign secretary, and now Home Secretary, Mr Cleverly is one of the Cabinet’s more experienced pairs of hands, though he ranked only 14th among ministers in ConservativeHome’s poll in May.  However, the Army Reserve Lieutenant Colonel is yet another Tory heavyweight likely to lose his seat, according to the Savanta survey, threatening to scupper any leadership ambitions he might harbour.Former Home Secretary, WithamTipped as a grassroots favourite, Ms Patel was recently urged by supporters to stand for the Tory leadership if the party is defeated at the election. Friends said she had not ruled out the possibility of standing but was focused on retaining her Witham constituency in Essex, which she is set to lose to Labour, according to the Savanta poll.Former Prime Minister, Member of the House of LordsThe Foreign Secretary, could technically make a dramatic return as Tory leader, given that there is no requirement for the head of the official opposition (or indeed any opposition party) to hold a seat in the House of Commons. However, such a move would be unprecedented in modern times. The former premier may also pay heed to the fact that he had a negative approval rating with ConservativeHome readers in May.Leader of Reform UK, Not currently an MPMr Farage is currently doing his level best to unseat as many Tory (and Labour) MPs as possible, presumably making him rather unpopular with the Conservative base. But some have speculated he could take the reins from Mr Sunak by defecting from inside Westminster, if he succeeds in his eighth bid to become an MP.Former Prime Minister, Not currently an MPCould Mr Johnson be the Tories’ once and future king? He will not be an MP on July 4, having given up his seat in June last year and opted not to run again. But, like Lord Cameron, he could technically lead from outside Westminster.Minister for Northern Ireland, WycombeMr Baker has indicated that he would put his name forward if he retains his seat in Wycombe, where he has a majority of just 4,214, on July 4.

161,"Rachel Reeves told how she has strived to persuade Britons to “trust me” with their money as polls showed her becoming the nation’s first female Chancellor within days.As millions of voters across the country are making up their mind over who to back on July 4, she gave reassurances over Labour’s plans for taxation and the economy.Speaking exclusively to The Standard, Ms Reeves said: “I remember when Keir appointed me to the job and he said by the time of the next election people have got to be able to trust me with their money.”In a wide-ranging interview, the shadow chancellor:Spoke of how she wants to grow the City hit by Brexit and some companies listing in New York rather than London.Said she has “nothing against expanding airport capacity,” as Heathrow mulls a third runway, but stressed factors such as the environment needed to be considered.Told how the Metropolitan Police “needs to sort itself out” as Labour vows to halve violence against women and girls within a decade if it gets into power.Rejected easing visa restrictions so London’s hospitality sector can recruit enough staff, stressing: “We want to get immigration down not up so I’m not going to make that commitment.”The Tories have thrown the kitchen sink at Labour on tax as they seek to persuade millions of voters not to trust Sir Keir Starmer’s party on the economy.They cite the note left in 2010 by outgoing Treasury Chief Secretary Liam Byrne to his successor: “I’m afraid there is no money.”So can the nation trust Ms Reeves on the economy and that a Labour government would not leave the public finances in such a state as 14 years ago, admittedly as it reeled from the financial crash.“Absolutely,” she responded.“In the three and a bit years that I have been shadow Chancellor the number one thing that I’ve set out to do is to ensure that people can trust me and do feel that they can trust me with their money which is why everything in our manifesto is fully costed and fully funded.”In a swipe at ex-Prime Minister Liz Truss and her Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s “mini budget,” she added: “I said we would introduce a new Charter for Budget Responsibility with tough spending rules, a fiscal lock so that never again can a Prime Minister and Chancellor try to force through a Budget without a forecast.“So, what people can know with me is that as a former Bank of England economist I’m absolutely committed to that fiscal discipline, the tough rules that are needed to get our public spending under control and our public finances back under control too.”Yet the questions on tax keep on coming, so are there any undisclosed Labour plans to hike levies on the banks in the Square Mile?“Obviously, I worked in the City both at the Bank of England and then in the private sector in financial services, I see our financial services in the UK as a huge asset where there is huge potential to bring more jobs, to export more, to grow that part of the economy,” she said.She stressed Labour had set out “limited tax changes,” such as on non-doms, extending the windfall tax, and changes around how bonuses are treated in private equity, before the phone line goes as she heads to the new constituency of Earley and Woodley in Berkshire, not somewhere Labour would have had on its possible wins radar until recently.Sir Keir has said Labour will not raise taxes on “working people” which he later described as “people who earn their living, rely on our services and don’t really have the ability to write a cheque when they get into trouble”.Given this, what reassurances could the shadow Chancellor give to wealthy Londoners over whether taxes could rise on unearned income?“We have set out the tax changes that we need to make,” she replied, reeling of some of the rises already announced, before adding “beyond that there is nothing in our plans that would require further tax changes.”Labour is banking on restoring healthy economic growth to Britain, which has been elusive in the post-Brexit years, so it can invest more than already announced into public services.But what about council tax and whether it is fair that someone living at One Hyde Park pays less per year than someone living in an average home in Barking & Dagenham, London’s poorest borough (£1,946 v £2,002 a year).“I want taxes to come down,” said Ms Reeves.“But the focus of an incoming Labour government is going to be on growing the economy rather than on tinkering around with tax rates because in the end the way to make people better off is to bring wealth and prosperity, and good jobs, to London and across the UK,” said the Lewisham-born shadow Chancellor.She stressed there would be “difficult decisions” including for example on planning.Pressed on a third runway at Heathrow, she said: “We would need to look at all the evidence at that, but I have nothing against expanding airport capacity.“I want heathrow to be that European hub for travel.“We would need to look at all the evidence including around the environment, but you know I back our airports.“I back investing in infrastructure.”Some hospitality chiefs in London are struggling to recruit enough staff and would like to see visa restrictions eased so these posts could be filled by workers from abroad.But Ms Reeves stated: “Look, we want to get immigration down not up so I’m not going to make that commitment.“We want to work with businesses to help them get the skilled staff that they need but immigration is close to a record high.“We need to focus much more on helping people already in this country get back to work.”She added: “We have a lower participation rate in the labour market than before the pandemic.“We need to get those NHS waiting lists down, help people get back to work, make sure that the welfare system is really geared towards getting people back into work, that’s the answer, not just the lever of immigration.”Labour is pledging to recruits hundreds more teachers and police officers for London but many public sector workers are simply unable to afford to live where they work in the capital so what would the party do to solve this dire situation?Ms Reeves turned partly to the Mayor of London, explaining: “Sadiq in his time as Mayor has trebled the amount of affordable housing built, compared to what he inherited from Boris Johnson and we have made a commitment, an incoming Labour government to build 1.5 million in the first term of a Labour government.“We will work with Sadiq and of course with our other mayors, but I recognise the chronic housing problems in London, to ensure that mix including affordable housing in London and including social and council housing in London.“But in the end, we have got to increase the supply of housing if we are going to ensure that people can afford to buy a home of their own or indeed rent a place of their own.”But if public sector workers are not able to live close to where they work, many of them end up paying ever rising train fares.“We have got the biggest reform in a generation of our railways, bringing railways back into public ownership when those contracts come to an end, so that public transport is run for passengers and not for profit, that’s a commitment that we are making if we have the chance to form the next government,” Ms Reeves responded, though her words are unlikely to reassure some commuters.Labour has been accused of being too timid in some policy areas, which is pushing some young voters towards other parties, such as the Greens.Mr Khan has backed rent controls for the capital, so why won’t Labour do so?“In the end the reason prices go up is because there is a mismatch between demand and supply so our focus is on increasing the supply of housing,” said Ms Reeves.The Mayor also took a political risk with the Ultra Low Emission Zone extension to Outer London, so should Labour be bolder on climate change?Ms Reeves, who Labour has claimed would be Britain’s “first green Chancellor”, insisted: “Our Green Prosperity Plan, the creation of both GB Energy, a wholly publicly-owned energy company where the returns go to the taxpayer, as well as the National Wealth Fund to invest alongside businesses in some of the jobs and industries of the future, while also looking to lower people’s bills, they are pretty bold and exciting moves.”But again is Mr Khan being bolder on free school meals for all primary school pupils, a step that Labour has not adopted.“We are committed to free breakfast clubs at all primary schools,” she said.“But I think people understand the inheritance that an incoming Labour government will have if we have the privilege of forming the next government, we are not going to be able to do everything that people might want us to do.“So we are focusing on those free breakfast clubs to ensure that all children get a really good start to the day and also to help mums and dads work more hours by being able to drop their kids off at school a little bit earlier, that will be our priority.“But if we were going to start making more funding commitments, we would have to say where that money is going to come from and I’ve been really clear that everything in our manifesto will be fully costed and fully funded and that means that you have to say no to people who have got perhaps good ideas but you add them up and if you tried to do all these things it would mean higher taxes and I’m not prepared to do that.”Labour’s manifesto lays out a “landmark mission to halve violence against women and girls in a decade”.Asked whether the Met Police should be making tackling violence against women a higher priority, Ms Reeves said: “An incoming Labour government will make it a higher priority.“It’s a real scourge on our society.“I think something like 2.6 per cent of rape cases end up in a prosecution within the same year.“So many people now just don’t even report rape and sexual crimes because they know that they are not going to get justice and that is a terrible state of affairs.”She added: “The Met needs to sort itself out but also needs to make sure that these serious crimes are reported and then the evidence followed through to conviction.”Tories in Chelsea and Fulham, and Kensington and Bayswater, two marginal seats, believe that Labour’s plan for VAT on private school fees, is swinging some voters their way.“The majority of the children in those two constituencies go to state schools,” said Ms Reeves, a claim disputed by some Conservatives.“And our commitment is to reinvest every single penny of that money (from the VAT change) into our state schools,” she added.“I think most people would agree that the real challenges in our education system are those children who are at state schools where they are not being taught by qualified teachers, where there are not enough text books, pens, paper in the classroom, that those are the kids that are missing out on the first-rate education that businesses tell us is absolutely critical for them and their businesses.”","'Trust me' with your money, Rachel Reeves tells voters across UK as July 4 polling day looms",21,0

They’re not mutually exclusive.“And some of the agreements we’ve got with France are bilateral in any event. I think they need to be stronger and better and deeper, particularly in relation to smashing the gangs that are running the vile trade of putting people into boats.“But there are also EU measures. The security agreement we want with the EU when it comes to dealing with smuggling gangs is really important.”Asked whether he was concerned a Eurosceptic French government could make his aim of closer economic ties more difficult to achieve, he said: “I genuinely don’t want to get ahead of myself. Firstly, we haven’t seen the final outcome in France. We’ve also got a big outcome of our own on Thursday.“I don’t think it affects the overall intention we have, which is to negotiate a better deal with the EU. I think the deal we’ve got is botched.

162,"Recriminations have begun to fly around the Conservatives as a senior figure called the last few weeks the “worst campaign in my lifetime” and criticised the party for failing to tackle the threat from Reform.Rishi Sunak started the week with warnings against handing Labour a “supermajority” and a “blank cheque” and claimed a vote for Reform would hand more power to Keir Starmer.However, a number of Tory candidates, advisers and officials are deeply frustrated with how he has run the campaign after calling a July election against the advice of his key strategist Isaac Levido.One senior Tory party figure said on Monday it had been the “worst campaign in my lifetime”, saying that while Sunak was wholly to blame for the early election, there was a feeling that Levido could have pushed back more against the July date and that Conservative HQ should have “taken the fight to Reform” earlier.They said Levido had made it clear from the start that 2019 Tory switchers from Labour were “gone and never coming back”, telling candidates that all their efforts should be made to target potential Reform voters instead.However, the source said some people around the cabinet table had argued that the Tories should just ignore Nigel Farage’s party, and the campaign had been too frightened to tackle Reform’s arguments head-on for fear of offending voters who sympathised with them.The senior figure said the mood among many Tory candidates was that it was “tough out there”, while those whose seats were less difficult were “focusing on what’s left and what’s next” – a new Conservative leadership battle.They also said candidates in tight marginal seats were getting zero financial or practical support, even on social media, and there was frustration that Conservative HQ had either overspent in the run-up to the election or wrongly thought it would get a last-minute deluge of funding.There is also suspicion among some Tory candidates that CCHQ could be holding back some funding to rebuild the party after an election defeat rather than going all-out on defending candidates.Many Conservative candidates are upset that they do not feel as supported by CCHQ as they were in 2019, with top party figures and cabinet ministers having to spend time defending or winning their own seats rather than on national strategy.One Tory candidate defending a majority of more than 10,000 in the south-east said they had had to raise all their own funding for their local campaign and felt it would be “very tight” against the Liberal Democrats.Another contrasted their local campaign with the national one. “The local party has been really efficient at identifying the messages that resonate and getting leaflets out to the right people,” they said. “As for the national campaign, well, I know all campaigns have mistakes but I’ve never seen anything like this.”One senior Tory claimed the only message that was resonating with the party’s voters was the line that failing to vote Conservative would hand Labour a supermajority on Thursday. They pointed out that the warning had been made largely off-the-cuff during a broadcast interview with Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, rather than as part of the prime minister’s strategy.In an interview with the Times, Starmer said such a majority would allow Labour to “roll up our sleeves and get on with the change we need”, saying the party needs a strong mandate to make changes the “whole country” wants.At a rally in Oxfordshire on Tuesday, Sunak will appeal to wavering voters to lend him their support to stop Labour winning by a huge margin, saying the result is “not a foregone conclusion”.“If just 130,000 people switch their vote and lend us their support, we can deny Starmer that supermajority,” he will say. “Just think about that: you have the power to use your vote to prevent an unchecked Labour government.”On Monday, Sunak rejected the idea that he had failed to tackle the threat of Reform as he toured a warehouse owned by the Tory donor Zameer Choudrey.Asked what he would say to those who thought he should have confronted Farage’s arguments head-on, he said: “I think it’s not right [to say that] because in the first week I said a vote for anyone else including Reform is a vote to put Keir Starmer in power. I’ve been consistent in that throughout the campaign. That’s the reality.“If you are someone who wants control of illegal migration then a vote for anyone not Conservative means a vote for someone who will make us the soft touch of Europe.”Pressed on whether it was right to have gone for an early election given he has acknowledged that the polls point to a Labour supermajority, Sunak insisted his timing had been right as the economy was looking up.He twice refused to comment on questions about what he thought about the rise of the far right in France, saying he was focused on the UK and his own campaign.Sunak hinted he might stay on as Conservative leader for a few months after the election if there was demand for him to do so while the party elects a new one, saying: “I love this party dearly and of course I’ll always put myself at the service of it, and the service of my country.”",Senior Tory criticises ‘worst campaign in my lifetime’ as frustration grows,21,8
208,"Rishi Sunak has started a 48-hour blitz around the country with a desperate final appeal to voters to support him in order to “stop a Labour supermajority”.The prime minister kicked off a final push on the last two days of a dramatic general election campaign, with a speech claiming that just 130,000 voters could make the difference.He told demoralised supporters and party activists to remember the spirit of the England football team pulling level in the 95th minute on Sunday, saying: “It’s not over until it’s over.” It comes as:Sir Keir Starmer starts his own final push in the key battleground of the MidlandsA leading pollster warned the result will be much closer than the polls seem to indicateTory MPs in the North and Midlands said they believe they are in close fights and can winLabour privately warned the polls may have made their supporters complacentSupport for Nigel Farage’s Reform UK appears to be ebbingRishi Sunak says he has not given up hope (PA)In a speech on Tuesday as he fires up his battle bus for a whistle-stop tour, the prime minister will say: “The outcome of this election is not a foregone conclusion. If just 130,000 people switch their vote and lend us their support, we can deny Starmer that supermajority.“Just think about that: you have the power to use your vote to prevent an unchecked Labour government.“So we must redouble our efforts in these final days, and deliver the strongest Conservative voice in the next parliament. We are fighting for the future of our country, and every door we knock on, every leaflet we deliver and every call we do will make a difference.”Mr Sunak will point out that “a huge number of seats” in this election “will be decided by just hundreds of votes”.He will add: “So, every vote we move will have an impact, and make it more likely that your Conservative candidate is returned to parliament so that they can be your voice, represent your values and stand up for you. And prevent Labour from rewriting the rules so that they can stay in power for decades.”It comes after he tried to whip up concerns about defence under a Labour government, just as new figures revealed the Tories cut 23 army regiments over the course of their 14 years in power.Conservative peer Robert Hayward believes the result may be closer than the polls suggest (PA)But Mr Sunak’s analysis that the election is much closer than many believe it to be is supported by leading pollster and Conservative peer Robert Hayward.Lord Hayward correctly predicted the Tory victory in 1992, despite the polls suggesting that Labour was going to win power. He also predicted a victory for the Conservative Party in 2015, and its failure to win in 2017, in spite of what the polls were saying.He now believes the polls are wrong again, and is particularly critical of MRP polls, which claim to be more accurate than others.He said: “I see no evidence, broadly, that the polls are any better now. The difficulty they face is that you have a volatile electorate.“We’ve got large numbers of undecideds, so it makes it very difficult to be sure as to how accurate the polls are, and I think they are inaccurate. I think they are overestimating the Labour Party. They’re underestimating the Conservatives. Some have overestimated Reform.“I think, having said that, the errors are not going to mean that it’s anything other than a clear Labour majority – but there is still a lot to fight for, and a great deal of uncertainty.”Lord Hayward said Labour may fail to gain seats in some parts of the North and the Midlands, because traditional support for the party among Muslim voters has switched to Muslim independent candidates.He also believes the problem of racists supporting Reform UK has hit that party’s vote share, which he believes will top out at around 13 per cent and is now falling.He added: “There will be parts of the Reform vote in places like Lincolnshire, which might have been strong but will be offended at the suggestion that they are actually racist, and will therefore not necessarily vote Reform. They might all go back to the Tories, but I think there are parts of the country where that sort of thing will be more damaging than others. Three days out, Reform’s vote is not stable and is dropping.”Nigel Farage speaks to the media following Reform UK’s Birmingham rally on Sunday (PA)Lord Hayward was dismissive of the MRP polls.He said: “These are supposedly authoritative indications, but ... you have MRP polls suggesting the Tories are going to get 50 seats, 100 seats and 150 seats, all within 24 hours of each other. That’s a 300 per cent inaccuracy.“But the ultimate MRP idiocy is Exmouth and Exeter East, where MRP polls have suggested that four different political parties are going to win the seat.”He also notes that the polls were “not borne out” in the local elections, where the Tories easily outperformed their predicted results, and that they have also been confounded by a series of council by-elections in the last few months.Lord Hayward’s analysis is supported by feedback from Conservatives in the so-called red wall areas in the North and Midlands.In the North East, Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen, who held on in May despite what the polls suggested, told The Independent: “It’s pretty positive. I’m hopeful if our data is right.”A number of Tory MPs in the North West, Midlands and Yorkshire believe they can hold on, including in one constituency where the bookmakers are quoting 10/1 on a Conservative victory. The polls would suggest they have no chance.Bassetlaw MP Brendan Clarke-Smith, who thinks his seat is too close to call, has suggested that Reform UK are picking up more Labour voters in his area.This is backed up by a JL Partners poll that claims that Reform UK is now taking 7 per cent of Labour’s 2019 vote, a statistically significant increase from 3 per cent last week.However, the Conservatives are far more gloomy about the south of England – the so-called blue wall of traditionally safe Tory seats – where they expect to suffer significant losses, including potentially a number of cabinet ministers, headed by chancellor Jeremy Hunt in Surrey.Candidates in seats where the party has a majority of less than 10,000 have been told to go and help those with larger majorities instead of trying to defend their own seats.However, it is understood that Labour is “nervous” about the result, with so many undecided voters.Polling by Techne UK for The Independent last week showed that a third of voters have described themselves as either “won’t vote” (24 per cent) or “undecided” (9 per cent). Postal voting has already begun, but more than three-quarters of people who intend to vote will not do so until Thursday at the polling station.",Sunak in last-ditch attempt to rally Conservative voters with threat of a Labour ‘supermajority’,21,9
126,"Matt Barbet grilled Maria Caulfield on Sky News SkyA Sky News presenter refused this morning to let a Tory minister twist Keir Starmer’s revelation that he does not like working late on Fridays.The Labour leader – who has a 20-point lead over the Tories in the polls – told Virgin Radio he “will not do a work-related thing after six o’clock, pretty well come what may” on a Friday night, so he can spend time with his family.But the Tories have attacked Starmer already over this, saying he would be a “part-time prime minister”.On Tuesday, Sky host Matt Barbet asked Tory candidate and health minister Maria Caufield: “How important to you is work life balance?”She replied: “It is pretty important but I would say as a minister, it’s not really that feasible.“Probably what you’re alluding to Keir Starmer saying that he’ll do a four-day week and finish at six o’clock every evening –”Before she could even get to the end of her sentence, Barbet said: “No – no, no, no, no.“He didn’t say he was going to do a four-day week, he said he was going to finish work at six o’clock on a Friday, like many people do.“And I believe that’s to help his wife observe her Jewish faith, which is commonplace amongst Jewish people.“So not a four-day week, that’s not true.”Caulfield largely ignored the correction but said she was also a person of faith and believes a “work-life balance is extremely important”.However, she claimed Starmer “has indicated that he wants to have a more flexible working life approach”.Caulfield continued: “That’s just not possible. I’m a junior minister, I work seven days a week, often close to 20-hour days, so it is slightly concerning that’s the approach he’s taking.“And he’s never been a minister. He’s probably not aware of the extreme pressures you’re under. Yes, it’s important, of course it’s important, and you make better decisions when you have a good work-life balance.“But when you’re running the country you do have to put the country before your party and a lot of other things, as well.”She said she was also a carer, but “your family does suffer” when you’re in government.Barbet pushed: “Why though? Does that set a good example – job first, family second? What are the most important things in life if not your family, your children. He’s a dad of school-age children.“So surely you would not begrudge the man – if he does become prime minister – if he does spend time with his kids?”She said PM Rishi Sunak also has two young children, and to do the government job well, it takes time and sacrifice.Barbet noted: “Why in this country do we champion working all the hours God sends?“Maybe that’s why, as a minister, your Conservative colleagues have decided it’s just not worth it and are not running in the election.”Seventy-four Tory MPs previously announced they were standing down at this election.Caulfield said that if Labour will the election, many of its MPs will realise just “what a tough job it is” being in power.""[Sir Keir Starmer has] never been a minister.

31,"As the UK seems likely to swing to the Left on Thursday, Labour’s beloved European Union is not just going Right, but is heading in the opposite ideological direction to Starmer’s party. On everything from migration to military intervention, Labour would find itself an outlier.This surge has a new champion: not France’s Marine Le Pen, but Hungary’s prime minister Victor Orban. The closest ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin among EU leaders, he has frequently opposed EU initiatives to support Ukraine in its defence against the illegal Russian invasion.Now, to make things even more unstable, Orban has announced plans for a new hard-Right bloc in the European Parliament to oppose further military support to Kyiv. He will be joined by Right facing allies from the Czech Republic and Austria in an attempt to form the new “Patriots for Europe”.If polls are to be believed, then Sir Keir Starmer’s foreign and military team are going to have to hit the ground sprinting on Friday morning. For be in no doubt: the Kremlin will fully test them over the next few weeks, using the EU elections – or Orban’s new prominence – as a springboard.Frankly, Hungary taking control of the EU Council, as is its right as a member, makes a mockery of the institution at a pivotal moment. You really can’t make it up: only a bureaucracy this narrow-minded and inflexible could dream of giving one of its most vocal critics such a huge platform. During Hungary’s six months in charge, it will set the tone of discussions, praising Putin at every opportunity, and attacking liberal institutions and values. Meanwhile, Ukraine will be desperately fighting to put itself in the best possible position before the US Presidential election in November, as is its right after experiencing the horror of continual Russian bombardment.Orban is at least in Kyiv today, visiting the Ukrainian president Zelensky for the first time since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. That is something, but if you look at his recent remarks about not wanting to give Ukraine any weapons, you can see his real goal is to set the stage for peace negotiations. But any negotiations now, or any time soon, would mean allowing Russia to freeze the front lines with 18% of the country under illegal occupation. It should be unconscionable.Don’t believe me? Orban’s own press chief Bertalan Havasi said, “The most important topic of the talks is the chance to create peace.” This sounds like a comment coming out of the Kremlin, not Brussels. Putin must be delighted.As such, amid this crisis of leadership in Europe, Starmer, if he becomes PM on Friday, must focus on defence requirements before anything else. The Russians will exploit any weakness, and with a good many of his front bench having been in the past anti-Trident – including the Shadow Foreign Secretary, David Lammy – Putin will be rubbing his hands.Starmer should commit to go much further than the Tories in arming Ukraine, and make an immediate commitment to increase defence spending to 2.5% by the end of this parliament, showing he is truly serious and not another weak leader. He should remove those from defence or foreign roles who could weaken Britain’s deterrent, including Lammy, and should seek to be the voice Europe desperately needs as France looks inward, Germany cowers, and the EU is split.Get this wrong and all the ‘great things’ Labour is planning could become irrelevant very quickly. I have been appalled at the lack of defence-related debates at this election. Fundamentally, Labour could be facing war in Europe over the next few months if things go awry. That would mean us facing the most dangerous moment since the Second World War.Would Labour be up to the task in that circumstance? We would have to pray they would be. But the jury is out.",Keir Starmer must lead the fight against Moscow,21,11
293,"Thank goodness it’s nearly over. Six weeks of half truths, obfuscation, false hopes and downright lies delivered by tieless, shirt-sleeved leaders in a variety of factories, building sites or sports grounds in front of audiences made up principally of party activists clad in hi-vis jackets. Apart from Ed Davey, that is, who has preferred to campaign in theme parks.Mind-numbingly boring televised debates have supplanted the hustings of yore, which at least ran the risk of a politician being heckled. Not since John Major mounted his soap box in 1992 have party leaders really taken their campaign to the country in any direct way. Everything since has been stage-managed to death.Even the gaffes this time have been self-inflicted, like leaving the D-Day commemorations early or betting on the election date. Where was Gillian Duffy when we needed her to expose a prime minister’s true colours and provide some light relief? The only good laugh was the Putin poster stunt at Nigel Farage’s rally, not that the Reform UK leader found it very funny.After all the sound and fury, if it could be called that, where are we on the eve of polling? The Conservatives began 20-points behind Labour in the polls and remain there, though I suspect it will be closer when the votes are counted, more like 14 per cent as in 1997.If anything has happened it has been the slump of the Labour Party which was notching up 44 per cent support at the outset but is now around 38 per cent. This suggests the Tory tax warning may have affected Labour’s vote, though without benefiting the Tories, who have haemorrhaged support to Reform ever since Farage re-entered the fray.Anecdotally, it is clear that some of those voters are now saying they will stick with the Tories after all because they have not liked Farage’s position on Russia and a failure to purge racist candidates, which might provide the Tories with a few more votes on the day. Unfortunately for Mr Sunak, the Lib Dems look likely to take dozens of Tory seats in the South.Remarkably, there are still a large number of undecideds, which, given the Government’s indifferent record over 14 years, says a lot about the opposition. Sir Keir Starmer may be ahead in the polls and the likely next prime minister but he has hardly set the country alight with his “change” mantra. He may win the biggest majority proportional to the vote received in history but his personal rating is still negative.As the election finishing line approaches, those about to drown grab anything to keep them afloat. Mr Sunak’s passing piece of driftwood was the suggestion that if he can only persuade 130,000 people to switch to the Tories by tomorrow he can achieve a hung parliament and deny Labour a “supermajority”.Usually a sitting prime minister will insist that he can win until the bitter end, so this amounts both to a concession and wishful thinking. Those 130,000 would have to change their minds on a uniform basis in dozens of constituencies to bring about the outcome Mr Sunak now seeks.He could hardly have imagined when he stood in the pouring rain outside Downing St on May 22 that six weeks later he would have been urging voters to deliver a hung parliament as the best result he could hope for.Indeed, it is hard to know what he expected from a campaign that never really got off the ground. And even if they do take off do they ever change things markedly in any case? Haven’t most people made up their minds long before the starting gun is fired?There have been some notable exceptions. The 2017 election called by Theresa May when she was 20-points clear in the polls resulted in a hung parliament because the campaign was so awful. The 1992 election won against expectations by the Tories was lost by Labour long before Neil Kinnock’s hubristic “we’re all right” outburst at the eve-of-poll Sheffield Rally.The die was cast by John Smith’s shadow budget informing middle England’s voters how much extra tax they would have to pay. Labour has not made that mistake this time – they will jack up taxes but will not tell us where until after we have voted.The 2015 election handed an outright victory to the Conservatives for the first time in 18 years and was a surprise even to David Cameron who had expected a hung parliament. Labour was virtually wiped out in Scotland which accounted for most of its losses but Ukip also ate into some of its support in England, allowing the Tories to hang on to seats they might otherwise have lost.Other campaigns have hardly moved the dial at all. The most enervating was the 2001 election which saw precisely 13 seats change hands and is remembered principally for John Prescott punching an egg-throwing protester. It was also marked most by voter apathy, with a turnout under 60 per cent. There are fears it will not be much higher tomorrow, or even lower.The first election I covered as a political journalist was in 1983 where, again, the campaign made little difference to an outcome everyone predicted from the outset. There were some similarities to now. One of the parties, Labour back then, faced an insurgent newcomer threatening to wipe them off the map.The Lib-SDP Alliance polled 25 per cent of the vote yet won just 23 seats whereas Labour with 27 per cent won 209. Mrs Thatcher secured a “supermajority” of 144 with 42 per cent. Such are the vagaries of our electoral system.The final days of the 1983 campaign were enlivened by an over-the-top speech from Neil Kinnock, not then leader of the Labour Party but its most effective orator: “If Margaret Thatcher wins on Thursday, I warn you not to be ordinary, I warn you not to be young, I warn you not to fall ill, and I warn you not to grow old,” he said.Well, if Sir Keir Starmer wins on Thursday I warn you not to be reasonably well-off, not to have accumulated a sizeable pension pot, not to live in the Green Belt, not to be an entrepreneur and not to worry about your country’s borders.These points, indeed, have been the basis of the Tory campaign; only no one is listening any more, assuming they have even taken much notice from the start. A three-week dash to the polls would have been preferable to this drawn-out agony. The result would have been the same.","If Keir Starmer wins on Thursday, I warn you not to be middle-class",21,11

Many also assume his title is hereditary.Here's what you need to know about the personal life of the man who wants to be the UK’s next prime minister.His early lifeStarmer was born in Southwark, south London, in 1962, as the second of four children. His parents were Labour Party members and named him after Keir Hardie, the party’s first leader in parliament.The family moved out of the capital and he grew up in Hurst Green, a village just outside the small Surrey town of Oxted. He was active in youth politics from his teenage years but was also a skilled musician, taking music lessons alongside Norman Cook, who later became better known as a member of The Housemartins and the DJ Fatboy Slim.Starmer played the flute, piano, violin and recorder and was a junior exhibitioner at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.His familyStarmer with his wife, Lady Victoria Starmer, at the Labour Party Conference in October 2023. (Alamy)Starmer is married to Victoria, a former solicitor who later retrained in occupational health and now works for the NHS. The pair met through their work in the law in the early 2000s and married in Essex in 2007.She was first seen accompanying her husband when the couple were filmed clapping for carers during the pandemic in 2020 outside their home in Camden. They have two children, a son and daughter, but both are kept out of the public eye.Victoria's father was Jewish and originally came from Poland, while her mother converted when they got married. Starmer has said in a previous interview that ""my wife in particular wants our children to know the faith of her family"" and that they ""observe some of the practices, for example Friday night prayers"".His parentsKeir Starmer with parents, Rodney and Josephine, at his graduation. (Twitter/Keir Starmer)The Labour leader's father, Rodney Starmer, worked as a toolmaker in a factory, and his mother Josephine Starmer (née Baker), was a nurse.His father worked 14-hour days but spent his time outside work caring for Josephine, who was diagnosed with the autoimmune condition Still’s disease. She required two hip and knee replacements twice in her lifetime and struggled with arthritic pain.As a young man Starmer also helped care for his mother, which he has said led to him being more emotionally reserved. His sister, Katy, recalled: “He’s had to be a grown-up all his life. I’ve always been quite open about my feelings – Keir is good at most things, but not that.” Josephine Starmer died in 2015, and his father three years later.His educationA photograph of a younger Starmer as shown on ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories in 2021. (ITV)Starmer passed the 11-plus examination, and attended Reigate Grammar School from age 11. While he was at the school it became an independent fee-paying institution, but as an existing student he was exempt from fees, and his tuition in the sixth form was covered by a bursary.After school he studied law at the University of Leeds, this first in his family to attend university, graduating with a first class degree in 1985. He undertook postgraduate law studied at the University of Oxford, where he served as editor of a radical magazine, Socialist Alternatives.Why is he a Sir?Keir Starmer pictured in 2010, when he was director of public prosecutions, making a statement about MPs who face charges over their expenses claims.

In 2008 he was appointed head of the Crown Prosecution Service and DPP.During his tenure he chose to prosecute three Labour MPs and a Conservative in the wake of the parliamentary expenses scandal, and was responsible for prosecuting former MP Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce for perverting the course of justice after Pryce claimed responsibility for her former husband’s speeding offence.",Who is Keir Starmer?

148,"On Monday, a senior Tory said the party’s current campaign was “the worst in my lifetime”. Which, unless that senior Tory is under seven years old, really means something – because it takes in Theresa May’s Darwin award-winning effort in 2017. One thing on which Labour and the Conservatives might agree is that this has been a deliberately and relentlessly negative Tory campaign, with the overwhelming majority of messaging and campaign ads targeted as attack lines.And with that, a warm welcome back to Sir Sleepy! Sir Sleepy made his debut back in May, shortly after the election had been called, when an anonymous Tory aide suggested Keir Starmer lacked the stamina to campaign. Like many, I assumed Sir Sleepy would be the first in a family of seven attack lines which would also include Sir Dopey, Sir Grumpy, Sir Bashful, Sir Sneezy, Sir Happy and Sir Doc. Yet, somewhat ironically, the Sir Sleepy attack line then lay dormant after failing to take, being rudely reawakened only on Monday night in response to Starmer saying Friday night dinner was dedicated family time.“I haven’t finished by 6pm, ever,” retorted Rishi Sunak. (On the plus side, he may well be completely done in time for Spain-Germany this Friday.) The Sir part of Sir Sleepy is, presumably, a dig at Starmer for having been given a title. Please remember this in the wake of the election when we meet Sir James Forsyth and Sir Isaac Levido, the prime ministerial advisers who have been operating heavy party machinery when apparently feeling very sleepy indeed.Next up in our attack line roundup is the red piggy bank motif. The red piggy bank has served as an attack dog – an attack hog, if you will – designed to reinforce the message that Labour will leave you poorer. Cycling through the attack ads, though, it is never quite clear which red piggy bank is going to show up. Sometimes the piggy bank is cast as a villain, a giant malevolent presence looming behind the glass walls of the office of the “trade union equality officer”.Businesses, if you think Labour will win, start saving. pic.twitter.com/Jd5DYRi4hF— Conservatives (@Conservatives) June 12, 2024But at other times it is a poor, defenceless little piggy bank, caught in a sharp-toothed Labour tax trap.Labour’s Tax Trap Manifesto has deliberately refused to rule out 18 new tax rises - including on your family home, your pension, your car and your business. pic.twitter.com/Kc541a18uU— Conservatives (@Conservatives) June 14, 2024Performance-wise, I never really know what I’m getting. If I were the red piggy bank’s agent, I would say it needs to find a clear screen persona and stick to it.This is something Grant Shapps eventually did, of course, having previously appeared as Michael Green, Sebastian Fox, and Corinne Stockheath. In fact, it was Grant who was responsible for another Conservative attack line: “Don’t give Labour a supermajority.” The meticulous planning of the prime minister’s campaign is perhaps epitomised by this particular one. A “supermajority” is a) not a thing in British politics, b) just a random line Shappsy chucked out in passing, and c) now arguably the central and therefore presumably most effective plank of attack on Labour. Quite a journey when you consider that amazingly – like Rebekah Vardy bringing her court case against Colleen Rooney – this is an election Rishi Sunak called himself.Things Labour will do with a supermajority include: leave the UK without electricity, flatten the greenbelt, and cuff our coppers (no idea). They’re also going to reverse Brexit, apparently – though with new polling showing a majority of Britons now believe leaving the EU was a mistake and has delivered few benefits, this possibly ought to be filed under “threatening the voters with a good time”.Labour opposes stop and search. They wanted to take tasers off our police. Don’t give Keir Starmer a supermajority to do this. pic.twitter.com/NDNNE7BakV— Conservatives (@Conservatives) July 2, 2024Moving on, we were informed that voting for Starmer’s party will “lock in Labour for a generation”. And yet, will it? It feels right to put the Conservative strategists’ minds at rest by pointing out that during this notional generation, there will be multiple and frequent opportunities for voters to simply vote for someone else. Opportunities which – spoiler alert – they will sooner or later take. This form of government is known as democracy.Next we have “Labour’s £2,000 tax rise”. This is the one where Sunak said “independent Treasury officials” said Labour’s policies amounted to £2,000 tax rise for everyone. Independent Treasury officials quickly wrote to say they didn’t actually say that. The attack was arguably further deadened by the fact that under the Conservatives, the tax burden has grown to its highest level in 70 years. Current poll positions suggest that either it failed to land, or we’re in “voters willing to pay £2,000 if it means Conservatives will go away” territory.By the way, Labour also want to abolish the monarchy. Yup, it has, quite frankly, been a rip-roaring election for the phrase “[citation needed]”. Furthermore, only one party breached royal protocol by featuring a picture of the king in a political ad. Naturally, I shan’t insult you by saying which.Nor will I offer you that other thing British voters are warned not to give Keir Starmer, a “blank cheque” – a phrase not hugely meaningful to anyone under the age of 40. Do not “surrender” your family to Labour, waving your big blank cheque like a white flag. Also, “don’t risk our food security”. That last one was – I think? – something to do with inheritance tax on farms. But it seemingly faded away midway through the campaign. They tried it as a position, but it didn’t get anywhere so they tried something else.Tell you who else is a flip-flopper: Keir Starmer! He backed Jeremy Corbyn, another Conservative attack line repeatedly sought to remind us, and this one seemed to make more headway than many of the others, judging by sceptical public questions to Starmer in debates and phone-ins. See also the issue of protecting single-sex spaces. Ronald Reagan famously said, “If you’re explaining, you’re losing,” and we might add that if you’re constantly saying “my position is clear on this”, then your position isn’t clear on this.What else? Oh, plenty. From national Ulez zones, to Labour preparing to leave Britain without military defences, to Sadiq Khan wanting to divide Britain (the London mayor is not, incidentally, standing in this election). Also: “Illegal migrants are waiting for a Starmer victory”. But why are they waiting? It’s not like they’ve been backward in coming forward – or rather, backward in coming across. The styling suggests that in Calais, there is a queue of people wishing to make small boat crossings who are waiting for 5 July.Labour, in contrast, have stuck religiously to a very few simple attack lines, alongside their positive-adjacent message of “change”: 14 years of Tory chaos, Liz Truss made your poorer, and don’t wake up to five more years of this. Come Friday, this will surely be proved a much less sensible idea than throwing 37 different negative things at the wall each week and seeing what, if anything, stuck [citation needed].",Tory tactics make this a rip-roaring election for the phrase ‘[citation needed]’,21,8

He's in direct contact with the Royal Mail. Kevin is investigating this urgently.""I know there's extra resources going into this to try and do a sweep of all the sorting offices and make sure they're out there.""She added she is aware of ""a number of"" constituencies where people have not yet received their postal votes.Ms Caulfield said those who will be at home on polling day this Thursday and have received a postal vote late can take them to their local polling station.However, she said it is a concern for those who are away as the deadline to apply for a proxy vote, where someone else is allowed to vote on your behalf, has passed.Read more:Five things the main parties aren't talking aboutManifesto Checker: The parties' key pledgesConcerns in ScotlandThere are specific concerns for voters in Scotland as schools broke up for the summer holidays on Friday, so many families have already left the country.The SNP's Stephen Flynn told Sky News the situation is a ""shambles"" and said his party had warned the Conservatives not to hold the election now as so many families in Scotland would be on holiday.He said the government told them they could vote by post so the fact they have not received their ballots in time is ""outrageous"" and could affect the outcome of the vote where seats are tight.He said the blame ""lies at Sunak's doorstep"".25% voting by postAt the last general election, in 2019, 21% of people voted by post.That number is expected to have increased by 20%, with more than 1.3 million postal vote applications made between 22 May and 19 June, according to the Local Government Association.A spokesman said: ""This unprecedented increase adds more pressure to an already complex process and overburdened system.""Councils and electoral staff across the country have been doing their utmost to ensure the smooth running of this election and that people can vote.""We are aware of reports of incidents where delays have happened.

363,"WITH the General Election just days away, candidates up and down Scotland will be looking to win over as many voters as they can before they head to the polls.Leading up to the election all the major UK parties have outlined their vision of what they would like to achieve in the next parliament in their manifestos.In the coming days, The National will take a closer look at all the pro-independence parties' documents.The Scottish Greens launched their manifesto on June 20 in Edinburgh, where the party said the battle to tackle climate change will be won or lost in the next UK Government term.Ahead of polling day, on July 4, here’s a look at the Scottish Greens' main points.The climate emergencyThe climate emergency is set out as the most urgent issue in the manifesto, taking up the first 11 pages.If the Scottish Greens were to get an MP, they have pledged to call on the UK Government to drop the “anti-climate” Offshore Petroleum Licensing Bill, revoke recently issued licences for new oil and gas extraction in the North Sea, and prohibit licences for new offshore oil, gas and coal exploration and extraction.(Image: PA)The Greens have been particularly vocal of late on the SNP’s “shameless retreat” on oil and gas after Kate Forbes claimed her party was not against new licences.Other climate proposals in the manifesto include a £28 billion per year Green New Deal investment programme, ending subsidies and handouts to the fossil fuel industry and returning the National Grid to public ownership with net zero as its “foundational mission”.The economyThe manifesto focuses on “taxing wealth, not workers”, suggesting the UK tax system unfairly places a higher tax burden on low-income workers.The Greens have pledged to introduce a progressive annual wealth tax on the top 1% of households in the UK, those with £3.4 million and above. This would start at a marginal tax rate of 1%, rising to 5% for those with £5.7m and above, and 10% for those with £18.2m.It is claimed this wealth tax would raise at least £70 billion for public services.READ MORE: Patrick Harvie blames 'deeply irresponsible' Rishi Sunak for postal vote 'chaos'The manifesto also pledges to tackle tax avoidance and evasion, merge national insurance into general income tax, the banning of zero-hour contracts and reform of inheritance tax to calculate it based on the circumstances of the recipient.The party also argues that with independence, Scotland would have full control over taxation and financial policy and the Greens are calling for full devolution of remaining taxation powers prior to independence.WellbeingThe Greens say they want a total ban on benefit sanctions which cause “extreme hardship” and will oppose any further increases to the state pension age, pressing for earlier access to the state pension for people with disabilities.Other proposals include an end to the benefit cap, bedroom tax and the two-child limit which has pushed 85,000 children in Scotland into poverty.READ MORE: Nuclear will ‘leave legacy of debt and radioactive waste’, says Lorna SlaterA whole page of the document is also dedicated to introducing a Universal Basic Income which would ensure everyone has enough to live a “basic but dignified life”.There is a proposal that a right to paid leave for people who need time off due to the effects of menstruation of the menopause should be created as well as a new legal entitlement to compasionate leave in the event of the death of a close relative or friend.Upholding democracyThe Greens’ manifesto puts forward an argument for a written constitution in an independent Scottish republic.(Image: PA)The power for Scotland to hold constitutional referendums should be devolved, the party says, but it is noted in the manifesto that “more works needs to be done to persuade the people of Scotland of the benefits of independence”.There are also arguments for removing Section 35 from the Scotland Act and repealing the Internal Market Act.",See the key points in the Scottish Greens' manifesto ahead of the General Election,21,10
135,"Nigel Farage and Reform have made the biggest splash on social media of any UK party and politician this election.The right-wing party and its leader have amassed over 2.8 million reactions on Facebook since the start of the election, according to data analysed by Hootsuite, a social media analytics platform.Mr Farage’s official Facebook page alone has garnered 2,100,00 reactions and shares, with the Reform page taking 719,000. This marks by far the largest Facebook interaction rate for any party or politician.By contrast, prime minister Rishi Sunak received just 270,000 Facebook reactions, while Labour’s Sir Keir Starmer attracted 300,000.The Labour Party page has garnered 267,000 reactions since 22 May, when the election was called, while the Conservatives have gained just 163,000. The two parties’ combined Facebook engagements are at just 60 per cent of Reform’sMr Farage also leads engagement on X (Twitter), with 13.9 million likes and retweets; while his videos have been viewed a combined 39.4 billion times on the platform during the election.Tweets from the Reform account are also the highest for party engagement, at 9.3 million interactions.However, the Labour Party’s videos on X – including endorsements from Elton John — are the second most popular during the campaign, garnering 11.3 billion views, or 13.2 billion if combined with Sir Starmer’s account.This compares to 8.8 billion views for Mr Sunak and the Conservatives, 4.5 billion views for Reform alone, 4 billion views for the Green Party, and just 260.4 million views for Ed Davey and the Lib Dems.Meanwhile, Mr Sunak has the highest engagement on Instagram (2.6 million) since the election was called, due in part to his large following on Instagram – 3.6 million followers.What does this tell us? Not much necessarily, other than the fact that Reform’s target audience is highly engaged on social media, particularly Facebook. It is also unclear how much this engagement will translate into material gains this week.Crucially, while the party may have an increasingly wide reach on social media, it lacks concentrated support in most constituencies; with latest polls estimating Reform could win five seats at best.But it’s impossible to ignore that Mr Farage in particular has a social media star-power which other politicians have failed to leverage, with even the prime minister making a tiny splash on social media in comparison.",Farage amasses 39 billion video views as Reform dominate social media election battle,21,9

So insidious from those aware of why he chooses to be with his family specifically on Friday evenings.— John Mann (@LordJohnMann) July 2, 2024Lord Mann, a Labour peer who was appointed as antisemitism adviser by Theresa May, said: “The attack on Keir Starmer for asserting his right to family time on a Friday night, as he has done for many, many years, is so dangerous.“So insidious from those aware of why he chooses to be with his family specifically on Friday evenings.”He told the PA news agency: “It’s a very strange thing to attack over. I’m the independent adviser to the Prime Minister and my advice would be this is not an area to stray into.”He pointed out that Friday nights had a wider cultural significance within the Jewish community, likening it to Sundays in Christian communities.“There’s a reason Parliament does not sit on Sundays,” he said.Sir Keir said Tory attacks on his desire to spend Friday evenings with his family were a sign of “increasing desperation, bordering on hysterical”.Asked about the criticism he has faced, he told reporters at a campaign event in Nottinghamshire: “This is just increasingly desperate stuff.”Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: “The attacks on him are a total disgrace and it shows how far these people have fallen, how heavily they’re scraping the barrel and why they need to be removed from office on Thursday.”Virtually every military intervention we’ve carried out has happened at night, partly to keep our servicemen & women safe.The British people will wonder who would be standing in for Starmer between 6pm & 9am – Angela Rayner, David Lammy, Ed Miliband?Defending Britain's…— Rt Hon Grant Shapps (@grantshapps) July 1, 2024Asked on Times Radio if he would work beyond 6pm on a Friday, Mr Streeting said: “I’m sure I will be and I’m sure Keir will be doing so too.”The Tories have repeatedly attacked Sir Keir since he made the comments on a Virgin Radio interview on Monday morning.Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said on X: “Virtually every military intervention we’ve carried out has happened at night, partly to keep our servicemen & women safe.“The British people will wonder who would be standing in for Starmer between 6pm & 9am – Angela Rayner, David Lammy, Ed Miliband?

And you would never expect a leader to do that.Pressed again on his top team, he added: “Well, I'm not going to run through a list of names however hard you try. But what I will say, because this is important, is that in each of the briefs in each of the departments we've been working on for years, on what needs to change how it needs to change how it needs to fit together, we want a purpose driven government, which will make material change for our country for the better.”It is a stark contrast to the 1992 election when Neil Kinnock infamously introduced his next cabinet on the stage before polling day at a rally in Sheffield only to lose.The answers come amid speculation that Sir Keir could make some dramatic changes to his cabinet from his current shadow cabinet team.In particular, questions have been asked about David Lammy becoming foreign secretary with suggestions that former cabinet minister Douglas Smith, who is hoping to make a return to parliament as MP for East Lothian, could get the job instead.Others are thought to be at risk even with a sizeable Labour victory with the Greens hoping to unseat shadow culture secretary Thangam Debbonaire in Bristol West and an independent candidate posing problems for Shabana Mahmood in Birmingham Ladywood.There have also been calls from some on the left of the party for Wes Streeting to not get the role as health secretary because of his support of using the private sector to bring down waiting lists.Sir Keir may also be looking for a new role for his campaign coordinator Pat McFadden who has been a major figure in the campaign.",Starmer refuses to guarantee anybody a job in his new government,21,9
