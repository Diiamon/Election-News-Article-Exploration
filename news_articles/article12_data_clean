The Independent,"Boris, a Jaguar XJL and a Greggs: on the campaign trail with Jacob Rees-Mogg",[],Alex Ross,20 June 2024 at 3:33 am·9-min read,20,June,2024,03:33:00,9,"On display inside Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg’s untidy office are three large portraits: Sir Winston Churchill, Boris Johnson and himself.They hang from cream-coloured wallpaper behind a cluttered wooden desk at the centre of the HQ for Sir Jacob’s uphill campaign to win the North East Somerset and Hanham constituency – his fifth straight term in the area.“Boris went up when he became leader... we always had the leader up,” says Sir Jacob, looking up at the pictures. “Then Covid came and we’ve hardly used the office since.”No Liz Truss, then. But what about Rishi Sunak, will he get his place next to Churchill?‘Um... well, we will eventually,” Sir Jacob says, with a wry smile. “We’ll see how much we need it after the election, when he’s returned comfortably as PM. Yes, absolutely.”It’s 17 days to polling day on 4 July and I’m in Keynsham, on the edge of Bristol, following Sir Jacob’s general election campaign.The HQ for Sir Jacob’s campaign is a hive of activity ahead of morning canvassing (The Independent)Hidden down an alleyway between Bargain Booze and a local solicitor’s firm, it’s a struggle at first to find the office (I initially mistake it for the former Keynsham and District Conservative Club, where early-morning drinkers are sipping their first pint) but I get there eventually.Boxes of delivery leaflets cover most of the carpeted floor while the chairs and the steep stairwell are filled with around eight friendly members sipping coffee and chatting before the day’s canvassing.“The national polls... you know, we don’t read those,” says Margaret Brewer, Sir Jacob’s upbeat agent, with the latest poll from Ipsos projecting the worst post-war result for the Tory party.Suddenly, Sir Jacob appears at the doorway wearing a dark grey double-breasted suit with a large blue rosette.We shake hands before he picks an issue up with his agent. The local BBC channel is planning an election debate, and he’s concerned the Green Party candidate has not been invited.A map showing the redrawn constituency is displayed in Jacob Rees-Mogg’s office (The Independent)“It doesn’t seem fair,” he says, showing genuine concern, before heading outside to discuss the plan for the day in private.Sir Jacob was elected MP for North East Somerset 14 years ago. It’s a constituency he’s comically described as circling the city of Bath – where Lib Dem Wera Hobhouse was previously MP – like dough around the jam in a doughnut.But his political rite of passage came in 1997 when he was parachuted into a virtually unwinnable seat for the Tory party in Central Fife. A quick search online reveals pictures of the smartly dressed 27-year-old knocking on working-class doors.“There was no Bentley, sadly,” Sir Jacob laughs, correcting subsequent media coverage as he fondly recalls the campaign. “I’d knock on people’s doors and say, ‘I’m Jacob Rees-Mogg, I’m the Conservative candidate, can I count on you for your support?’“More often than not, people would laugh ... they did think it was very funny that a Tory was asking for their vote.”Fast forward 27 years, and electoral campaigning for Sir Jacob remains “very similar” – although in Longwell Green, where we are heading for canvassing today, the reception is likely to be different.The pretty urban suburb on the edge of east Bristol has a strong Conservative following – five out of the six local councillors are Tories – which Sir Jacob wants to cement ahead of the general election.‘More often than not, people would laugh,’ says Sir Jacob, thinking back to his first election campaign in Central Fife (Getty/Colin McPherson)And unlike on the Central Fife campaign, there’s no family nanny, Veronica Crook, in tow while knocking on doors – although his mother, Lady Gillian Rees-Mogg, does show up in the afternoon to help in the office.It takes eight minutes to drive from Keynsham to Longwell Green, where it doesn’t take long to spot the lanky figure of Sir Jacob talking to a woman in a cul-de-sac, or his smart Jaguar XJL parked nearby.This is a leafy area with a modern housing estate of large semi-detached homes, many with pristine front gardens. With the sun out, many residents are busy mowing lawns and cutting hedges.The area, like the neighbouring wards of Bitton and Hanham, will join the old North Somerset constituency as part of boundary changes at the election.But polling isn’t looking good for Sir Jacob.Labour’s Dan Norris, mayor of the West of England and former MP for the seat, is projected to win comfortably, with 42 per cent of the vote according to Survation’s MRP, followed by Sir Jacob on 27 per cent, Lib Dems on 14 per cent and Reform UK with 12 per cent.Mr Norris’s election leaflet features a “Stop Rees-Mogg” stamp. “Absolutely delighted that he’s advertising me,” says Sir Jacob.Sir Jacob accepts the national polls are “not encouraging reading for the Conservatives”, but he urges caution at “an extrapolation of a national poll into a constituency poll” for the local projections.Voter Geoff Meek shakes Sir Jacob’s hand during canvassing in Longwell Green (The Independent)And on the doorstep in Longwell Green, the early signs are promising.After finishing talking to the woman on her front lawn, Sir Jacob goes to two addresses where people tell the former business secretary he has their vote. At the second address, a resident who is taking a break from fixing his dishwasher shares his main issues: “Immigration and the taxes if Labour get in.”But around the corner, problems arise for Sir Jacob and his team.First, a mother holding her three-month-old baby abruptly says she won’t be voting for Sir Jacob, then, at the next door, a man says he’s considering voting for Reform UK.The theme continues at the next semi-detached home where a family are working on an extension outside.“We have always voted Tory but we’re feeling really disappointed,” says one of them. “People feel they [the Conservative Party] haven’t delivered on the things they promised to do. We are losing our culture because of mass migration.”Sir Jacob accepts their frustration. “We made a mistake,” he says, pointing to an expanded migrant labour force after the Covid pandemic. Legal migration is coming back under control, he says.But it doesn’t end there.One of the family draws parallels between Sir Jacob, Nigel Farage and Reform UK. “Why not be Reform?” he asks.“The party is bigger than the leader – the membership of the party has the view I have,” replies Sir Jacob, who goes on to openly question the quality of candidates standing for Reform.“A vote for them is a vote for Lib Dems or Labour,” he adds.But then he finds more support.Self-employed builder Geoff Meek, 58, stops work on a semi-detached property to shake Sir Jacob’s hand. “Things are going well for us,” he says, pointing to a rise in the national insurance threshold.Couple David and Ann Hockney also warmly welcome Sir Jacob at the doorstep of their home, although Ms Hockney, 71, admits she’s toying with voting for Reform UK. “Immigration,” she says, when I ask why.Down one cul-de-sac, at a large detached home, a woman who shakes Sir Jacob’s hand jokes she won’t wash her hands again.A retired man, Mike Morrison, standing outside his garage also gives the incumbent his backing.The 87-year-old, who has lived in the area for 43 years, tells Sir Jacob the former Tory MP Chris Skidmore, who resigned from his Kingswood seat over Mr Sunak’s oil and gas licence plan in January, used to live around the corner.Mark Bray tells Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg he’s undecided on who to vote for. Asked what the big issues are locally, he points toward a 5G mast near his home (The Independent)“The rotter,” quips Mr Morrison.That’s the next stop; Mr Skidmore’s old address, a detached home with a large driveway. Owner Martyn Chugg says he’ll be voting for Sir Jacob, adding that Reform UK’s manifesto is in “cuckoo land”.The 70-year-old says affordable housing is a big issue of the election, with his son in his thirties still living at the family home.As I watch the canvassers begin to wrap up the morning’s proceedings, plumber Anthony Murphy, 44, tells Sir Jacob he’ll be voting Reform. “Nigel is the only one who talks sense,” he tells me.I ask Sir Jacob how it’s gone.“It seems pretty encouraging,” he says, “but you’ve got to be careful. People are nice and good-mannered, and if someone’s polite to you it doesn’t necessarily mean they will be voting Conservative for you.“It’s very easy to assume a friendly comment, even a selfie, means they are a supporter, but it’s not always true.”Back in the office for lunch, where Sir Jacob has a Greggs ham and cheese sandwich and a box of eclairs, I put to him the possibility of losing his seat.“If you throw your hat in the ring, you must expect that sometimes people will throw the hat back at you,” he says.I then ask if he’s worried it could provide a “Portillo” moment – when former Tory leader contender Michael Portillo was defeated in 1997 – on election night.“If you look at the opinion polls, there can be about 100 Portillo moments,” Sir Jacob adds, with a laugh. “Portillo will have bred and taken over the world if it’s going quite the way the opinion polls indicate, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens.”The interview ends, and I realise I’ve been sipping Sir Jacob’s black coffee.“Oh, don’t worry,” he says, with a smile, as I leave him to finish lunch with his agent and mother ahead of a busy afternoon of canvassing in the battle for his political career."
The Telegraph,"Keir Starmer, Corbyn’s old ally, is a threat to national security",[],Liam Fox,20 June 2024 at 7:50 am·4-min read,20,June,2024,07:50:00,4,"While the British election process plays out, Russia continues its cruel and vicious aggression against the Ukrainian people with new war crime allegations continually emerging. A furious Putin threatens to supply Britain’s enemies with missiles that can strike the UK itself, in revenge for Britain supplying Ukraine with long-range storm shadow weapons.Iran carried out a massive bombardment of Israel which only avoided mass civilian casualties due to the defensive capabilities of Israel’s Western allies. Iran’s proxies, Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis continue to destabilise the Middle East with the latter attacking British-linked shipping and Royal Naval vessels.All the while, China flexes its muscles in the South China Sea and continues its cyber attacks against Western democratic states. Yet the lack of focus on Britain’s national security in this dangerous world and the obsession in most of the media with polls and personalities risks turning this into a cartoon election in a hardback world.The first duty of any British government is to keep the British people safe and this solemn responsibility has weighed heavily on the conscience of every prime minister.Boris Johnson, as prime minister, gave important international leadership on Ukraine, continued under Rishi Sunak, including at the much underreported G7 summit last week. As one American colleague on Capitol Hill put it to me, “if Britain hadn’t given the leadership it did to the West, the response to Ukraine in the US Congress would have been much more muted”. The consequences would have been profound indeed.Across the world an axis of authoritarian states is causing more instability, more rapidly, in more places and, along with its proxies, is attempting to reshape the world order against the fundamental values our country represents and that our troops have fought and died for – values of democracy, freedom and the rule of law. The ideological imperative is clear, and for the Conservatives it always has been – whether faced with the fascist regimes of the 1940s, the anti-nuclear movement of the 70s and 80s or the anti-Nato rhetoric of the Corbyn years.Which brings us to the current leader of the Labour Party and the man who would be prime minister in charge of our national security. This is the man who urged the nation to give Jeremy Corbyn the keys to No 10.When Keir Starmer said, “I do think Jeremy Corbyn would make a great prime minister”, did he mean the Jeremy Corbyn, who said, “I am against the replacement of Trident and the nuclear missile system that goes with it”?Did he mean the Jeremy Corbyn who said, “Wouldn’t it be wonderful if every politician around the world, instead of taking pride in the size of their armed forces, did what the people of Costa Rica have done and abolished their army.”Did he mean the Jeremy Corbyn who said, “Why don’t we turn it around and close down Nato” and “I’d rather we weren’t in it”?Maybe he meant the Jeremy Corbyn who said, “It will be my pleasure and my honour to host an event in Parliament where our friends from Hezbollah will be speaking… I’ve also invited friends from Hamas”?Having found it acceptable to urge the British people to make Jeremy Corbyn prime minister, how can anyone have confidence in Starmer’s judgement on our national security.Do we want an individual as prime minister who sat pliantly in shadow cabinet meetings, nodding his head to a man who entertained leaving Nato, scrapping the army, or sending chemical weapons back to Russia for analysis after the dreadful Salisbury attack?Can we risk the most powerful person in the country being someone who sat shoulder to shoulder with Diane Abbott, who once signed a parliamentary motion calling for the “abolition of conspiratorial groups like MI5”? Do we want individuals around the Cabinet table so strategically naive that they voted to scrap our nuclear deterrent?Remember that both Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader and David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, voted against the renewal of Trident in parliament.When disgruntled Tory voters say they want change they need to understand just how dangerous this “change” could be for Britain with a left-dominated Labour government.The Prime Minister has rightly committed to raising defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP, leading the European Nato nations. Threats will not abate in the coming years, security is not a certainty.Our adversaries are becoming stronger and more ambitious in their designs. In this complex strategic environment, do we really trust one of Jeremy Corbyn’s former lieutenants with British national security? The answer is emphatically and unequivocally not."
The Telegraph,Starmer forced to deny he will ‘flatten the green belt’ for housing,[],Emma Gatten,20 June 2024 at 6:51 am·2-min read,20,June,2024,06:51:00,2,"Sir Keir Starmer has been forced to deny claims a Labour official said the party was willing to “flatten the green belt” to build new homes.On Thursday, Politico quoted the unnamed Labour official as saying: “I don’t care if we flatten the whole green belt, we just need more houses in this country.”Asked about the report on Thursday, Sir Keir said: “We’re not planning to flatten the green belt.“What we are planning is to build the housing that is desperately needed: 1.5 million homes… That will require tough decisions.”The Labour leader added: “Of course we’re going to protect the countryside. We’ve got plenty of non-green belt areas that we can build on.Battle of the hard hats: Mr Gove said Labour would be 'unaccountable' - Leon Neal/Getty“But there are some bits of the green belt, disused car parks… We will take the tough decisions but of course we’re going to protect the green belt, as you’d expect.”Labour has promised to build 1.5 million homes over the course of the next Parliament if it forms the next government, and has said it will focus on what Sir Keir has called the “ugly, disused, grey” parts of green belt land.The party hopes to tap into widespread frustration over house prices and supply to overcome opposition from nature and community groups that want to protect open spaces.But the plans have already alarmed some campaigners, including the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), which has said it could lead to more speculative development.A spokesman for the CPRE said: “Keir Starmer is right that there are plenty of non-green belt areas crying out for houses to be built on them: there are enough shovel-ready brownfield sites for 1.2 million new homes in England alone.“If we didn’t already have the green belt we’d want to invent it. Green Belt land is the countryside next door for 30 million people in the UK and we welcome Labour’s manifesto commitment to protect it.”Michael Gove, the Levelling Up Secretary, said the comments in Politico suggest that “if Labour win an unaccountable majority, this shows they think they can do whatever they want”.He added that the Conservatives would achieve their pledge of building 1.6 million homes by abolishing stamp duty for the majority of first-time buyers and improving the Help to Buy scheme."
HuffPost UK,Pressure Mounts On Rishi Sunak As Tory Betting Scandal Deepens,[],Kevin Schofield,20 June 2024 at 7:12 am·3-min read,20,June,2024,07:12:00,3,"Rishi Sunak has not been seen today as he prepares for a Question Time debate tonight. LEON NEAL via Getty ImagesRishi Sunak is coming under mounting pressure to act over the betting scandal which has engulfed the Tories’ election campaign.The prime minister has been urged to suspend two Conservative candidates accused of laying wagers on the date of the election shortly before it was announced last month.One of them, Craig Williams, was Sunak’s parliamentary aide before parliament was dissolved.He has admitted having a “flutter”, prompting a Gambling Commission investigation.The other candidate is Laura Saunders, a member of Tory HQ staff whose husband, Tony Lee, is the party’s director of campaigns.Both of them are also being investigated, and Lee has taken a “leave of absence” from his post.In another extraordinary development in the controversy, one of the PM’s close protection officers has been suspended amid allegations that he also put a bet on a July poll.Pat McFadden, Labour’s national campaign co-ordinator has written to Sunak demanding he take action.He said: “Can I ask you very simply why you think that a serving police officer should be suspended from his role because of allegations that he made a bet based on inside information, while the two colleagues of yours who so far stand accused of the same offence ... are still being allowed to stand as Tory candidates in the election.“Surely you can understand that – yet again – this looks as though there is one rule for members of the Tory party, and another rule for everyone else, specifically on this occasion a serving police officer. If you can see how wrong that is, will you now at the very least remove your support for Mr Williams and Ms Saunders as Conservative election candidates?”The Conservatives have said they have been contacted by the Gambling Commission “about a small number of individuals”.But in his letter to Sunak, McFadden demanded to know “how wide this scandal goes”.He said: “If some of your most senior colleagues felt they had carte blanche to misuse the inside information they had on the election in order to make a profit, we must ask how many others had advance access to the same information, and placed bets either by themselves, or through their friends and family?“If you take the correct action now concerning Mr Williams and Ms Saunders – to ensure consistency with the treatment of your close protection officer – will you guarantee that anyone else who it emerges placed bets on the timing of the general election, whether in their own name or through a third party, will also be suspended?”Under the 2005 Gambling Act, the misuse of inside information when betting can lead to a prison sentence of up to two years.“No one is above the law and it is essential that the taint of corruption now surrounding the behaviour of some who may have known about the election date is properly investigated and punished,” McFadden said.Related...'Are The Tories Corrupt?'

PA Media: UK News,"NHS funding pledged by parties ‘well short’ of what is needed, says think tank",[],"Ella Pickover, PA Health Correspondent",20 June 2024 at 1:11 am·4-min read,20,June,2024,01:11:00,4,"NHS funding pledged by leading political parties “falls well short” of what is needed to make improvements in the service, a leading think tank has said.The Health Foundation called on politicians to be honest with the public about the scale of the crisis facing the NHS, and the amount of money needed to address issues.It said that an incoming government will face “difficult choices” – to increase taxes to provide more funding, reduce spending in other departments and services, or see the NHS “do less”.New analysis from the think tank concludes there is a potential £38 billion per year shortfall in the funding needed to improve the NHS by the end of the next parliament.Work by the Health Foundation’s REAL Centre suggests that funding in England will need to rise by an average of 3.8% per year in real terms over the next 10 years to meet rising demand and to deliver improvements across the service.This includes a higher level of growth of 4.5% per year in the first five years.Researchers projected what would happen if the health budget grows in line with the assumed growth in public spending factored into the Office for Budget Responsibility’s economic forecasts for the next parliament – real-terms funding increases of 0.8% per year.This level of growth would see the total Department of Health and Social Care budget increase to £197 billion in 2029/30 – leaving the healthcare system in England around £38 billion a year short of what is needed to drive improvements, experts said.A new Health Foundation report says the money is needed to bring “significant changes” to NHS services, and prioritises spending on GP care, mental health and community services.The analysis includes a 10-year timescale to tackle the backlog of routine hospital appointment – which is slower than Labour and the Conservatives have pledged.Anita Charlesworth, director of the Health Foundation’s REAL Centre, said: “The health service is in crisis and all the main political parties have said they want to fix it – yet the funding they have so far promised falls well short of the level needed to make improvements.“Politicians need to be honest with the public about the scale of the challenge the NHS faces and the reality that an NHS fit for the future needs long-term sustainable investment.In a #GeneralElection we often hear promises to employ more nurses.Jim Buchan explains that ‘more’ nurses at a national level also needs to translate into the ‘right’ number of nurses locally to provide safe care and increase productivity.Read more 👇https://t.co/KK2OJnj8xT pic.twitter.com/tdlwHvIilL— The Health Foundation (@HealthFdn) June 19, 2024“Honesty about this has so far been conspicuously lacking from the General Election debate, with both the main parties unwilling to spell out the difficult choices on public spending and taxation that will confront the next government.“The scenario we have set out is not overly ambitious – it is broadly in line with the pledges set out by the main political parties and public expectations, and assumes the NHS can deliver challenging improvements in productivity.”A Conservative Party spokesman said: “Thanks to our clear plan and bold action, we have virtually eliminated the longest NHS waits and overall waiting lists are falling at the fastest rate in over a decade outside the pandemic.“But there is more to do which is why our £3.4 billion Productivity Plan will transform the NHS with new technology and unlock £35 billion of cumulative savings by the end of the decade.“We will continue to increase NHS funding above inflation across the next Parliament to train and recruit 92,000 more nurses and 28,000 doctors through our Long Term Workforce Plan. We will deliver millions more scans, tests and checks as we cut waiting lists and deliver better care for patients.“Only Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives will take the bold action, backed by a clear plan, to build a brighter and healthier future.“Labour would take the country back to square one with at least £2,094 in higher council tax and other tax rises for every working family.”"
The Independent,Everything we know about Tory election betting scandal,[],Matt Mathers,20 June 2024 at 8:13 am·4-min read,20,June,2024,08:13:00,4,"Rishi Sunak’s election campaign was dealt another blow on Thursday after it emerged that a second Conservative Party candidate was being investigated over a bet on the date of the general election.Laura Saunders, the Tory candidate for Bristol North West, is understood to be under investigation by the Gambling Commission (GC) over claims she may have had inside knowledge about the prime minister’s decision to call a snap poll for 4 July.Ms Saunders has worked for the party since 2015 and is married to Tony Lee, who works as the Conservative Party’s director of campaigns. Mr Lee has since taken a leave of absence after it came to light he was also being probed by the GC.According to the BBC, which first named Ms Saunders as the candidate under investigation, she worked most recently at the party’s international division at Conservative Campaign Headquarters, which works with other centre-right parties around the world.What are the rules for MPs and others on betting with inside knowledge?Using confidential information to gain an unfair advantage when betting may constitute a criminal offence.Gamblers are not allowed to use inside information to place a bet or to instruct someone else to do so on their behalf.They are also not allowed to pass inside information on to someone else which they use for betting.Laura Saunders (Laura Saunders)Additionally, the MPs’ code of conduct bars members from “causing significant damage to the reputation and integrity of the house”.An MP placing a bet with inside knowledge is likely to cross this threshold.Who else is being investigated?Ms Saunders became the second Tory candidate to be investigated by the Gambling Commission over claims of having insider knowledge about the 4 July poll.Craig Williams, the PM’s parliamentary private secretary, admitted placing a bet on the election prior to Mr Sunak’s announcement after he was approached by a journalist.The 39-year-old Tory candidate for Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr placed a £100 bet with 5-1 odds at Ladbrokes, meaning he would have won £500, but his name was raised as potentially a “politically exposed person”, so the wager was not registered.The bookmaker is believed to be particularly cautious over “novelty” betting markets such as the general election.According to The Guardian, which first reported the story, the bet was placed via an online account that would have required Mr Williams to provide personal details, including his date of birth and debit card. The bookmaker also knows the location of the bet.Ladbrokes declined to comment on the incident but the Gambling Commission issued a statement confirming that it was investigating.Mr Williams apologised after admiting that he had placed a wager on the bet, but refused to comment further while the GC carried out its probe.“I clearly made a huge error of judgment, that’s for sure, and I apologise,” he told. “I will not be expanding on my statement because it’s an independent process.”Close protection officer arrestedA police officer in Mr Sunak’s close protection team was arrested and suspended over alleged bets about the timing of the general election.The police constable from the Met’s Royalty and Specialist Protection Command was arrested on 17 June on suspicion of misconduct in public office after the betting watchdog contacted the force last Friday.The officer was taken into custody and bailed pending further enquiries, with the case being referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, according to the Met.What have senior Tories said about the scandal?Mr Sunak said it was “very disappointing” news that Mr Williams was being investigated by the GC.“Well, it’s very disappointing news and you would have seen Craig Williams say that it was a huge error of judgement,” he told broadcasters at the G7 summit earlier in June.Michael Gove, the outgoing cabinet minister, said it would be “reprehensible” to use inside information to bet on the general election date.“If people have used inside information to place bets, that is deeply wrong,” he told the BBC on Thursday morning after Ms Saunders’s case came to light.“What I can’t do is sort of get too much into the detail of the case while an investigation is going on.“But I can talk about the broad principle and you’re absolutely right, it’s reprehensible.”"

He had a majority of 12,000 before the boundary change.In the wake of the revelation the Guardian also revealed that the Gambling Commission asked bookmakers to trawl through all substantial bets placed on a July election.The watchdog wrote to all licensed bookmakers requesting information on anyone who stood to gain more than £199 by betting on a July election in the UK.A Conservative party spokesperson told the BBC: “We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals. As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn’t be proper to comment further, until any process is concluded.”Keir Starmer called for the Conservatives to suspend Saunders. “This candidate should be suspended and it’s very telling that Rishi Sunak has not already done that. “If it was one of my candidates, they’d be gone and their feet would not have touched the floor.”Separately, one of Rishi Sunak’s close protection officers has been arrested over alleged bets about the timing of the election.The officer was arrested on Monday on suspicion of misconduct in public office, the Metropolitan police said.The Metropolitan police said they were contacted last Friday by the Gambling Commission, which informed the force that it was looking into alleged bets related to the timing of an election by a constable from the Met’s royalty and specialist protection command.“The matter was immediately referred to officers in the Met’s directorate of professional standards, who opened an investigation, and the officer was also removed from operational duties,” the force said.The matter has also been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), the watchdog responsible for overseeing the system for handling complaints made against police forces in England and Wales.The Met added: “The Gambling Commission continues to lead the investigation into the alleged betting offences, and our investigation is running in parallel to that.”Labour’s campaign chief, Pat McFadden, has written to Sunak urging the Conservatives to withdraw support from Saunders and Williams while they are being looked into.In a letter to the prime minister, McFadden said: “Can I ask you very simply why you think that a serving police officer should be suspended from his role, because of allegations that he made a bet based on inside information, while the two colleagues of yours who so far stand accused of the same offence – Craig Williams, your PPS, and Laura Saunders, a member of your CCHQ staff and partner of your campaigns director – are still being allowed to stand as Tory candidates in the election on 4 July?.”He added: “This looks as though there is one rule for members of the Tory party, and another rule for everyone else, specifically on this occasion a serving police officer.”McFadden said if it emerged that Williams, Saunders and any other candidate had placed bets on the timing of the election they should be suspended."

Both are now being investigated by the Gambling Commission.It means that the Tory election campaign which was already on the ropes with Labour holding a massive 20 point lead is without its campaign director.Rishi Sunak has lost his director of campaigning (James Manning/PA Wire)The revelation has thrown an already catastrophic Conservative campaign into complete crisis with allegations centring around Rishi Sunak’s inner circle.Last week it was revealed that his closest parliamentary aide, Craig Williams, who was the prime minister’ parliamentary private secretary, was under investigation after “having a flutter” of £100 on the date of the election just three days before it was called by Mr Sunak.Ms Saunders, like Mr Williams, is now under investigation by the Gambling Commission with one of his close protection police officers also facing inquiries over a bet they made on the election date.In a move which seems to highlight the Tories haplessness during the campaign, the latest revelations over alleged insider betting comes after they launched a gambling themed attack advertisement on social media against Labour.Unlike the two Tory candidates, the police officer has been suspended from duties.Now it has emerged that Mr Lee, who would have been one of the few people to know the election date has been forced to step back from his duties.While claims he has been suspended have not been confirmed, the Tories now enter the closing stages of the election without one of their key organisational figures.This after polls yesterday appeared to confirm that the party is heading for the worst defeat in its electoral history with a potential wipeout at the polls.Married couple Lee and Saunders are both under investigation by betting watchdog (Supplied)Mr Lee is a shadowy figure in the backroom of the Tory operation but holds a key position in organising the campaign.

What will he do to those involved?

Voters are sick to the back teeth of this endless carousel of chaos, sleaze and scandal.""People across the country are crying out for change and that is why in many areas they are backing the Liberal Democrats to get a strong local champion that will take their issues right to the heart of Parliament and not take them for granted any longer.""A Conservative Party spokesman said: “We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals.“As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn’t be proper to comment further, until any process is concluded.”The spokesman added: “The director of Ccampaigning took a leave of absence from CCHQ yesterday.”"

Yahoo News UK,What is tactical voting and why are some people against it?UK voters will head to the polls to elect the next prime minister on 4 July.,"['What is tactical voting?', 'How does tactical voting work?', 'The argument against tactical voting', 'How could tactical voting impact the 2024 election?']",Jimmy Nsubuga,Updated 19 June 2024 at 2:37 pm·5-min read,19,June,2024,02:37:00,5,"UK voters will head to the polls to elect the next prime minister in two weeks' time on 4 July.Political parties have been busy campaigning following the snap election announcement by Rishi Sunak, who revealed the vote would be held on Thursday 4 July.The Conservatives are currently trailing Labour by a significant margin in the polls, with the latest polling figures showing Labour projected to potentially secure a record number of MPs and the Sunak himself in danger of losing his seat, which would make him the first sitting prime minister to do so.Other high-profile Tory MPs - including Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Liz Truss - are also facing the prospect of being ousted by voters.Some tactical voting campaigners are eager to make this a reality - with the Conservatives (as the sitting party in government) the most likely to be on the sharp end of such initiatives.Indeed, the Best for Britain campaign group says it wants to inflict the “heaviest possible election defeat” on the Conservatives. It believes that its GetVoting.org initiative could help oust several prominent Tories, including Sunak and Hunt.What is tactical voting?Tactical voting is when someone chooses to vote for a candidate who would not be their first choice, or perhaps a candidate they would not even have considered voting for previously.The idea is that by voting for that candidate, you are doing your bit to stop another candidate winning.It tends to apply in constituencies where two candidates are close in numbers, and significantly out in front of their opponents.Some voters employ tactical voting as a strategy to counter the UK's 'First Past The Post' (FPTP) voting system, where a candidate with the most votes wins.This can result in an MP being elected even though the majority of voters supported candidates from a different political spectrum.For example, a Conservative candidate may win in their local constituency if the vote is divided between left-wing candidates from the Labour and Green Party.Voters will head to the [polls on 4 July. (Getty)How does tactical voting work?A scenario where tactical voting could come into play is when a voter’s preferred candidate is likely to come third with no realistic chance of winning.In this case, the voter could vote tactically by choosing to vote for one of the two candidates who will win the seat.John Boken, a 43-year-old secondary school teacher from Oswestry, is one of millions of registered voters who is preparing to cast his vote for a party that is not his top preference.Despite his inclination towards Labour, Boken feels he has to support the Liberal Democrats to prevent the Conservative candidate from securing the seat in his constituency.An example of tactical voting in action would be a traditional Labour voter who voted for Brexit in 2016 opting to vote for the Conservative candidate in their constituency in the hope of getting a Tory majority and avoiding a hung parliament which they may fear would lead to a second EU referendum.On the other hand, a traditional Tory voter who wants the UK to remain in the EU could lend their vote to the Labour or Lib Dem candidates in a bid to avoid a Conservative majority government.Meanwhile, back in 1997, tactical voting group Get Rid of Them (Grot) targeted 90 seats across the country where tactical voting could secure the defeat of the Tory candidate.And in 2017, the then Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron called on traditional Tory and Labour supporters to vote tactically to bring Conservative numbers down.The argument against tactical votingOne problem with this approach, some argue, is that you end up with a situation where a voter is choosing a candidate who's policies they may disagree with.The Electoral Reform Society, a campaign group opposed to the first-past-the-post system, says switching to some form of proportional representation (PR) would remove the need for tactical voting.Such a system would see, for example, a party that receives one-third of the vote expecting to gain one-third of the seats in parliament.They say this would remove much of the impetus for voters to try and hack their way around the current system.In a blog post on the group's website in 2022, Willie Sullivan wrote: ""No voter should have to vote tactically. But tactical voting is an inevitable symptom of our failing first-past-the-post system used for Westminster elections.""As voters are given just one preference and only one candidate can become the MP in each constituency, votes for all the other candidates go to waste. This all-or-nothing system means that voters have to choose between voting with their hearts or working around the system to get the best outcome in their area.""This kind of voter behaviour is ... sadly a symptom of our electoral system anytime votes head to the polls. The 2019 general election was the most recent example of a ‘hold your nose’ election – where millions of voters were forced to vote for the ‘least worst option.""Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

The Telegraph,"Truss to blame if Tories lose election, suggests Gove",[],Daniel Martin,20 June 2024 at 6:25 am·3-min read,20,June,2024,06:25:00,3,"Michael Gove has suggested that Liz Truss is to blame if the Conservatives lose the election.The Housing Secretary said the Tories’ chances of re-election had taken “a bit of a knock” because of the former prime minister’s disastrous mini-Budget.However he refused to name Ms Truss, referring instead to the “period between Boris and Rishi”.Mr Gove, who is stepping down at the election, urged his Tory colleagues not to lurch to the Right if Labour wins.He admitted it would be a “stretch” for the Conservatives to win, warning that there was a risk Labour could become a “forever government”.Speaking before a visit to a building site in west London, he said: “One of the challenges in particular that we face is the reputation for sound economic management, which is essential to Conservative success, took a bit of a knock in the period between Boris and Rishi.“That was undoubtedly a challenge, and we’ve had very good economic management since then.“I don’t want to say I can draw definitive conclusions, because votes haven’t been cast – but if you ask what made the election more difficult than it might otherwise have been, it’s that period.“There are other challenges that we have as well. There’ll be an opportunity after the election, whatever the result, for us to assess where support may have waned, where it held, and where it might have improved.”Speaking at The Times CEO Summit, Jeremy Hunt, the Chancellor, said a Conservative win at the general election was not “the most likely outcome”.Asked whether he could win in his constituency, Mr Hunt said his seat was “too close to call” and that he was still meeting “a lot of people who say they haven’t yet made up their mind”.Earlier, Mr Gove warned that Labour could use a large majority to “rig the system” and create a “forever government”.He told Sky News: “I hope we are getting our message across on tax and one of the things is that if people do reflect on the polls, and of course some may, they will ask themselves this question: If Labour do have that really big majority, what is to stop them rigging the system?“What is to stop them giving votes to EU citizens, 16-year-olds, prisoners, and making sure that they could be a forever government?”He also urged colleagues not to turn further to the Right, saying the Tories had to espouse social justice.“Whatever happens – whether we win the election, which I hope we will, or we lose – the Conservative party is at its best when it embraces the spirit that we had in 2010 and 2019 of recognising that you need to be a party that appeals to every part of the country, in background and in geography,” he said.“We can’t be a party of just property owners – we need to be a party of renters and those who aspire to own property.“We can’t just be a party that safeguards those who have done well because of hard work, we’ve got to be a party on the side of those who aspire to both do better economically and contribute to society. In broad terms, the Conservative Party succeeds when it believes in hard work and enterprise, and social justice.”Mr Gove said he would not get into the issue of partygate and whether that was having any impact on the election."
