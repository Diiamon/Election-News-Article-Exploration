The Telegraph,Tory candidate James Cracknell labels party ‘a shower of s---’,[],Timothy Sigsworth,24 June 2024 at 11:30 pm·2-min read,24,June,2024,11:30:00,2,"A former Olympic rower standing for the Conservatives at the election has described the party as “a shower of s---” in an official campaign video.James Cracknell, who won gold for Team GB at the 2000 and 2004 Olympic Games, also appeared to suggest that candidates and officials who allegedly bet on the date of the election were guilty of an “abuse of trust”.He is standing in Colchester, Essex, a seat that has not been won by Labour since 1945. The Conservatives won it with a majority of 9,423 in 2019.“Two weeks out from the Olympics, if we are competing against the Conservative Party my teammates and I would be saying they are a shower of s---,” Mr Cracknell said in the video, posted on his Facebook page on Saturday.“And if one of my teammates got caught for cheating, they’d be dead to me. That abuse of trust is unforgivable.”Mr Cracknell also said that candidates and officials who bet on the date of the election were guilty of an 'abuse of trust' - The GuardianHis remarks came a day after it was reported that a fourth Conservative is under investigation for allegedly betting on when the election would be called. Nick Mason, the party’s chief data officer, has denied wrongdoing.Craig Williams, Rishi Sunak’s parliamentary private secretary, Tony Lee, the Tory director of campaigning, and Laura Saunders, Mr Lee’s wife, who is standing in Bristol North West, are also under investigation by the Gambling Commission.The Prime Minister said on Monday that the Tories were conducting an internal inquiry into the scandal and that he was “not aware” of any other candidates being accused of having placed a bet on when the election would be held.Mr Cracknell said: “So why am I still canvassing and delivering leaflets? Because I believe the Conservative way is the best for the country – freedom to succeed, protection of our national security and personal responsibility. If any party deserves to have the Union Jack on its literature, it’s the Conservative Party.”He also vowed to not “blindly defend things that have gone on in the past that I don’t agree with” if elected as the city’s MP.“I’ve a pretty strong moral compass, and believe in right or wrong, and there’s things that have been wrong,” he said in an interview with The Guardian on Monday.“I’m just going to be really honest if I agree with something or not. That may annoy some people in central office, but I’m fighting to represent the people of Colchester and they’re my priority.”"
Yahoo News UK,Who will win the next general election?

All the polls use the multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP) technique, which enables projections to be made at constituency level.And while all three polls indicate Sunak faces an uphill battle to avoid a major defeat, there is a significant disparity from all three as to how far ahead Keir Starmer actually is.Yahoo summaries the key points of the three pollsTories to slump to lowest number of seats since party's formationYouGov's polling for Sky News projects Labour is on course to achieve a 200-seat majority. Labour is predicted to secure 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.This projection would show the Tories plummeting from the 365 won by Boris Johnson in the 2019 election and give the party their lowest ever number of MPs. It would also give Starmer more seats than the 418 won by Tony Blair in 1997. Read a full report of this poll from Sky NewsThe YouGov poll for Sky News.Conservatives on course for worst defeat in over a centuryAccording to polling by More In Common UK for the News Agents podcast, Labour is projected to finish on 406 seats, a majority of 162.

This polling puts Labour on a massive 516 seats, with the Tories on only 53 - just in front of the Lib Dems on 50 - a forecast that would be remarkable were it to be reflected on polling night.

Given the nature of these seat totals, it is natural to be slightly sceptical.""It adds: ""Not every MRP is the same. The statistical 'building blocks' used to model voter behaviour will vary from pollster to pollster, which will in turn lead to different vote shares and seat totals. All different pollsters will get different national vote share.""The MRP methodology, as described by YouGov, ""uses data at the constituency level to predict the outcomes of seats based on the concentration of various different types of voters who live there"".Stuart Wilks-Heeg, writing in The Conversation earlier this month, points out some of the other limitations of MRP polling: ""There are ... factors MRPs cannot take into account. Some constituency results will be influenced by locally specific issues that statistical models can’t capture. For example, adjustments cannot be made for who the candidates are in each constituency and whether any have a profile that could enhance, or detract from, their party’s chance of winning. Think Nigel Farage standing for Reform UK in Clacton.""And competing MRPs produce contrasting outcomes because each model uses specific assumptions and data. Different inputs produce different outputs. This election has seen more MRPs produced than ever before, and from various organisations. In the early hours of July 5, we’ll know which one came closest to getting the result correct.""What are the latest odds?As of 19 June, Oddschecker – a website which compares odds across different bookmakers – had Labour at 1/41 to win the most seats. To put that in context, this is seen as so likely that a £10 bet would return just £10.24.The Conservatives are 40/1 to win the most seats, a scenario seen as so unlikely that a £10 punt would return £410.What went wrong for the Tories?YouGov's voting intention tracker between January 2020 and June 2024. (YouGov)So, why have the polls changed so dramatically? It's worth looking back on an extremely eventful four-and-a-half years in UK politics.According to YouGov's voting intention tracker (see chart, above), Tory support peaked at 53%, with Labour on 32%, in April 2020, months after the party's stunning success in the 2019 general election and Boris Johnson's pledge to “get Brexit done”. That month also saw Starmer take over as Labour leader from Jeremy Corbyn.This was also amid a spirit of national unity following the onset of the COVID pandemic which nearly killed Johnson himself. The then-PM had been released from hospital five days before this particular survey was taken.Boris Johnson delivers his final speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street in September 2022. (AFP via Getty Images)Over the rest of the year, there was a downturn in support amid chaos over COVID rules, with the Tories falling as low as 35% in November 2020, compared to Labour on 40%.However, the UK’s successful COVID vaccination programme provided a pathway out of lockdown and with it, improved poll ratings. Tory support peaked at 41% in June 2021, with Labour at 30%.In October that year, there was a sense Johnson was untouchable. At the Tory party conference, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg remarked how the PM was ""in total command of his party, and politically dominant in the country"".But this fell apart quickly with the Partygate scandal, which emerged in November that year. Time and again, reports emerged of government and Tory staff – including Johnson – having taken part in lockdown-era social gatherings when their own COVID rules had prohibited them.By January 2022, Tory support had plummeted to 28%, with Labour on 38%. Johnson struggled on, but never recovered and a wave of ministerial resignations forced him to resign in July that year.The UK had three separate prime ministers – Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak – between 6 September and 24 October, 2022. (Getty Images)His successor, Liz Truss, then embarked on arguably the most disastrous prime ministerial reign in history, characterised by the catastrophic ""mini-budget"", containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, which prompted an economic crisis. Like Johnson, she lost the confidence of Tory MPs – and voters – and had to resign.Her 49-day spell as PM was the shortest in history, with Tory support plummeting to 19% (with Labour on 56%) the day after she announced her resignation in October 2022.Rishi Sunak, who had lost to Truss in the previous month's Tory leadership election, took over. However, as the above YouGov chart indicates, he has failed to cut through with voters. Tory support was at 23% two days after he assumed office, with the most recent survey, carried out on Thursday, showing support is now lower than under Truss at 18%.In short, the polls and odds, not to mention other factors such as notable by-election victories for Starmer's Labour, are pointing to a Labour government next month.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

The Telegraph,"Tory candidates betting on election date is unacceptable, say two thirds of voters",[],Ben Riley-Smith,25 June 2024 at 7:56 pm·4-min read,25,June,2024,07:56:00,4,"Two thirds of voters think Tory candidates betting on the date of the general election is unacceptable, an opinion poll has found.The outrage cuts across political party lines, with broadly the same proportion of Tory, Labour, Liberal Democrat and Reform voters all expressing disapproval over the scandal.The finding in the latest polling by Savanta for The Telegraph chimes with claims from Labour figures that the Tory betting scandal is cutting through with voters.On Tuesday, Rishi Sunak finally suspended two Tory candidates, Craig Williams and Laura Saunders.Both are reportedly being looked into by the Gambling Commission for election bets.Mr Williams, the prime minister’s parliamentary private secretary, admitted 13 days ago to having a “flutter” on the election and 12 days ago accepted it had been a “huge error of judgement”.Mr Sunak’s action comes after an increasing number of Tory candidates were going public calling for suspensions and expressing fury at the behaviour alleged to have taken place.Some 2,300 voters across the UK were surveyed by Savanta from June 21-24 as part of regular election polling for this newspaper.One question asked: “Thinking about Conservative candidates who have placed bets on the date of the general election, which of the following statements best describes your view?”Some 67 per cent of all respondents agreed with the statement “it was unacceptable”. That was more than three times the 19 per cent who agreed “it was acceptable”. The rest selected “don’t know”.Mr Sunak's action comes after an increasing number of Tory candidates were going public calling for suspensions - HENRY NICHOLLS/AFPOften polling results show stark differences depending on which political party people plan to vote for, but in this case there was little difference in responses.The proportions who thought it was unacceptable was 67 per cent for Tory voters, 71 per cent for Labour voters, 77 per cent for Lib Dem voters and 71 per cent for Reform voters.So far, four Tory figures have been named in reports as being interviewed by the Gambling Commission over bets on the date of the general election.Mr Sunak surprised many in Westminster when he announced the election for July 4, rather than for the autumn.Betting data shows a surge of punts on a July election were placed just before it was announced on May 22.A close protection officer to Mr Sunak has also been arrested over election betting.The latest Telegraph-Savanta polling has Labour still with a vast lead, as the election campaign approaches its final week.Labour were on 42 per cent of the vote, followed by the Tories on 21 per cent. That 21-point lead is roughly in line with the average from other pollsters.The Tories gained two points, with Reform down two to 14 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 10 per cent.Some of those caught up in the betting scandal have put out public comments since reports broke that they were being looked into by the Gambling Commission.When first named by The Guardian, Mr Williams said: “I’ve been contacted by a journalist about Gambling Commission inquiries into one of my accounts and thought it best to be totally transparent.“I put a flutter on the general election some weeks ago. This has resulted in some routine inquiries and I confirm I will fully co-operate with these.“I don’t want it to be a distraction from the campaign, I should have thought how it looks.”A solicitor for Ms Saunders, the Tory candidate for Bristol North West, said that she was co-operating with the inquiry.On Tuesday, a Conservative Party spokesman said: “As a result of ongoing internal enquiries, we have concluded that we can no longer support Craig Williams or Laura Saunders as parliamentary candidates at the forthcoming general election.“We have checked with the Gambling Commission that this decision does not compromise the investigation that they are conducting, which is rightly independent and ongoing.”A spokesman for the Gambling Commission has previously said the body is “investigating the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election”.He added: “We are not confirming or denying the identity of any individuals involved in this investigation.”"
The Telegraph,Starmer wants to make good parenting illegal,[],Miriam Cates,25 June 2024 at 7:35 pm·4-min read,25,June,2024,07:35:00,4,"Throughout the last Parliament, a number of both Labour and Conservative MPs sought to pressure the Government into banning so-called ‘conversion therapy’.On the face of it, this may seem a noble aim. Some of the ‘therapies’ employed in the past to attempt to change a person’s sexual orientation were utterly abhorrent and included the use of electric shock treatment and rape. But of course – mercifully – these practices are now very much illegal, and the Government Equalities Office found no evidence that they are taking place today in the UK. Non-violent but coercive ‘practices’ are also illegal, and we have a whole host of legislation that covers harassment, sexual abuse, domestic abuse and homophobic speech and discrimination.Yet for many campaigners, this isn’t enough and they have repeatedly called not only for a ban on attempts to alter someone’s sexuality, but for this ban to include a prohibition on changing someone’s ‘gender identity’. And this is where the task of drafting effective legislation moves from the ‘difficult’ to the ‘impossible’ pile. Because, in law or in fact, there is no objectively verifiable definition or test of ‘gender identity’.This is why two attempts to bring Private Members Bills this year – one in the Commons and one in the Lords – have both failed. In speech after speech, MPs and Peers pointed out the Bills’ flaws, exposing the weaknesses of any legislation that would prevent parents, teachers and therapists from asking sensible questions and providing wise guidance to children who are questioning their gender. Both of these discredited laws could have resulted in parents, teachers and clinicians being criminalised if they deliberately set out to dissuade a child from ‘changing sex’.The sad truth is that, over the last 15 years, more and more children have been exposed to gender ideology, which is now rampant in school, institutions and social media across the Western world. The Tavistock scandal and the Cass Review exposed just how pernicious and dangerous this ideology is, especially to vulnerable children such as those with autism or who have experienced trauma. Countless thousands of children treated at NHS gender clinics were put on a path of irreversible physical and biological change – including the loss of healthy body parts, infertility, sexual dysfunction and lifelong health problems. This scandal happened because too many adults failed to question the idea that a child can or should ‘change sex’. Instead of giving these children wise and evidence-based counsel, clinicians – and some activist charities and even teachers – accepted that feelings of gender dysphoria in children as young as ten or eleven should be celebrated and treated as a real and irrefutable sign that they had been ‘born in the wrong body.’Yet rather than considering how to avoid a repeat of this tragedy the Labour Party’s response is to commit to bringing in a ‘trans inclusive’ conversion therapy ban that would make it even harder for responsible adults to protect children from the harms of gender ideology. Seemingly dismissive – or perhaps unaware – of the very serious unintended consequences for child protection and free speech that such a ban would invoke, Keir Starmer believes he can succeed where the Government and Parliament have failed.We understand that Labour’s ban would include ‘safeguards’ similar to those included in former Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle’s unsuccessful Private Members Bill. But these ‘safeguards’ were worthless, containing a multitude of contradictions, circular definitions and a failure precisely to define key terms such as ‘transgender’. Incomprehensibly, under Russell-Moyle’s Bill, a parent would have been ‘protected’ from prosecution under the conversion practices legislation, except if they were guilty of a conversion practice. As we have seen from cases brought under the Equality Act, it would take just one successful prosecution to induce a chilling effect on anyone who seeks to protect children.Conservatives who stand up to such extreme attempts to undermine society are frequently accused of stoking a culture war. But the truth is that it is those on the Left who are waging a full-on war on our culture, a culture which – until now at least – upholds the rights of parents to protect and guide their children as they see fit. The fact that Keir Starmer is willing to risk criminalising responsible parents tells us all we need to know about his ‘changed’ Labour Party."

Many also assume his title is hereditary.So what do you really need to know about the man who, on current poll ratings, is set to be the UK’s next prime minister?His early lifeKeir Starmer was born in Southwark, south London, in 1962, as the second of four children. His parents were Labour Party members and named him after Keir Hardie, the party’s first leader in parliament.The family moved out of the capital and he grew up in Hurst Green, a village just outside the small Surrey town of Oxted. He was active in youth politics from his teenage years but was also a skilled musician, taking music lessons alongside Norman Cook, who later became better known as a member of The Housemartins and the DJ Fatboy Slim.Starmer played the flute, piano, violin and recorder and was a junior exhibitioner at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.His familyStarmer is married to Victoria, a former solicitor who later retrained in occupational health and now works for the NHS. The pair met through their work in the law in the early 2000s and married in Essex in 2007.She was first seen accompanying her husband when the couple were filmed clapping for carers during the pandemic in 2020 outside their home in Camden. They have two children, a son and daughter, but both are kept out of the public eye.Victoria's father was Jewish and originally came from Poland, while her mother converted when they got married. Starmer has said in a previous interview that ""my wife in particular wants our children to know the faith of her family"" and that they ""observe some of the practices, for example Friday night prayers"".Keir Starmer with parents, Rodney and Josephine, at his graduation. (Twitter/Keir Starmer)His parentsThe Labour leader's father, Rodney Starmer, worked as a toolmaker in a factory, and his mother Josephine Starmer (née Baker), was a nurse.His father worked long, 14-hour days but spent his time outside work caring for Josephine, who was diagnosed with the autoimmune condition Still’s disease. She required two hip and knee replacements twice in her lifetime and struggled with arthritic pain.As a young man Starmer also helped care for his mother, which he has said led to him being more emotionally reserved. His sister, Katy, recalled: “He’s had to be a grown-up all his life. I’ve always been quite open about my feelings – Keir is good at most things, but not that.” Josephine Starmer died in 2015, and his father three years later.His educationStarmer passed the 11-plus examination, and attended Reigate Grammar School from age 11. While he was at the school it became an independent fee-paying institution, but as an existing student he was exempt from fees, and his tuition in the sixth form was covered by a bursary.After school he studied law at the University of Leeds, this first in his family to attend university, graduating with a first class degree in 1985. He undertook postgraduate law studied at the University of Oxford, where he served as editor of a radical magazine, Socialist Alternatives.A photograph of a younger Starmer as shown on ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories in 2021. (ITV)Why is he a sir?Stamer was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 2014 in recognition of his work in the legal profession, culminating in a five-year term as Director of Public Prosecutions.He first became a barrister in 1987 at the Middle Temple, later joining Doughty Street Chambers and was appointed a Queen’s Counsel in 2002, aged just 39. In 2008 he was appointed head of the Crown Prosecution Service and DPP.During his tenure he chose to prosecute three Labour MPs and a Conservative in the wake of the parliamentary expenses scandal, and was responsible for prosecuting former MP Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce for perverting the course of justice after Pryce claimed responsibility for her former husband’s speeding offence.Starmer on... the NHSThe Labour leader has said that, if elected, his government would “get the NHS working around the clock and pay staff properly to do it”.The remark followed a commitment to provide £1.1bn in funding for the health service to cut waiting lists by paying doctors and nurses to carry out additional out-of-hours care, which would be funded by axing tax breaks for wealthy “non-doms” who hoard money overseas. He added: “The Conservative Party that brought our NHS to its knees will put it in the ground. We have to get it back on its feet.”Starmer describes the NHS as “the crowdfunded solution for all of us”, reinforcing his commitment to healthcare being free at the point of use, but says reform is inevitable or the health service would “remain on life support”. He has pledged to integrate up-to-date technology into every part of the NHS including using artificial intelligence to diagnose disease earlier and more accurately.He supported the doctors strikes, telling ministers: “Don’t break junior doctors, talk to them. Get in the room [and] sort it out.”Starmer with his wife, Lady Victoria Starmer, at the Labour Party Conference in October 2023. (Alamy)Starmer on… immigrationThe government has “lost control of borders”, according to Labour. Starmer has said a Labour government would set up a new policy unit to tackle illegal migration and has suggested that a returns agreement for asylum seekers could be negotiated with the European Union to solve the small boats crisis.He described the government’s thwarted Rwanda plan, which would see illegal migrants deported to the African nation but has to be put into practice due to legal blocks, as a “gimmick” and a “farce” and has promised to reverse it.Starmer on... the cost of living crisisStarmer has sought to keep Rishi Sunak’s handling of the cost of living crisis in the minds of voters by claiming that “his fingerprints are all over their struggling household budgets”. In a letter to his shadow cabinet, leaked to The Guardian, he wrote: “Rishi Sunak is the chief architect of choices prioritising the wealthiest and of the government’s failure to get a grip of the economy and get growth going.”He has said he would prioritise tackling inflation, blaming it for putting up prices and eroding household savings, but has pledged to “take the difficult and responsible decisions” to bring it down.Starmer pictured in 2010, when he was director of public prosecution at the CPS, making a statement about MPs who face charges over their expenses claims. (Getty)Starmer on... private schoolsLabour has dropped its early promise to scrap charitable status for private schools, but has committed to levying a 20% VAT rate on school fees removing their “unfair tax break”. The money raised, he said, will be used to address the “appalling state” of the school system for all children.“It’s not an attack on private schools. It’s just saying an exemption you have had is going to go,” he warned private schools who have been critical of the plan – reminding them they are not obliged to pass that tax on to parents in the form of increased fees.Starmer on… the House of LordsWhen he was first Labour leader, Starmer proposed a “root and branch reform of the centre of government… rooting out unearned privilege and addressing unaccountable power”.But his promise to scrap the House of Lords within the first four years of a new parliament - a controversial move that caused a split among his party’s grandees, has been abandoned.Starmer still backs plans for a second chamber “electoral legitimacy”, but as his party nears government he has stepped away from the most radical form of that pledge. He is now reportedly committed to cutting the number of hereditary peers, reducing the size of the chamber and introducing a new appointments process."

A close protection officer for the prime minister was also suspended by the Metropolitan Police and is being investigated.Responding to the suspensions, Sir Keir Starmer told reporters: “Why didn’t that happen a week ago?”And shadow paymaster general Jonathan Ashworth said: “It is yet another example of Rishi Sunak’s staggeringly weak leadership that it has taken him nearly two weeks to see what was obvious to everyone else.Rishi Sunak had come under significant pressure to suspend the candidates (Getty Images)“The Conservatives who sought to line their own pockets by betting on the election date are not fit to be candidates for parliament.”And Mr Ashworth called on the prime minister to “come clean” about how many Conservative figures are implicated in the scandal and who they are.He added: “Just as with Partygate and the PPE scandal, the Conservatives believe it is one rule for them, another for everyone else.”The Gambling Commission has compiled a list of everyone who put a bet on a July general election after 1 May and is now “combing through the data and picking off people from that”, an industry source told The Independent.Mr Williams placed a £100 bet with 5-1 odds, meaning he would have won £500, but he would not have received the payout until after the contest. His suspension is a major blow for the party in Wales, as the Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr seat he was contesting is the only Welsh seat projected as a Tory win in a major seat-level YouGov poll last week."

He is now in a long-term relationship with the right-wing writer and journalist Isabel Oakeshott.She is perhaps best known for two notorious incidents that set her against leading Tories: a book that featured the heavily disputed allegation that David Cameron had engaged in sexual activity with a pig, and the release of embarrassing messages entrusted to her by Matt Hancock when she agreed to write a book with him.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election? Full list mappedThe key issues that will decide the electionWhen is the first UK general election TV debate?What is purdah? The strict rule that governs what politicians can and can't sayNet worthWhile not quite in the same league as Rishi Sunak, Tice is one of the wealthiest people in British politics. As he describes it on his website, he made his multi-million-pound fortune over the course of “30 years of making things happen in property investment”, starting with a graduate job at a London firm in 1987.According to Tice, the company he leads as CEO, Quidnet Capital, has “bought and managed £500 million in commercial properties across the UK on behalf of clients”.He was also a key figure in the redevelopment of London’s Nine Elms district, near Battersea Power Station, a controversial project that has transformed a stretch of the Thames’s south bank with a welter of rapidly erected high-rise blocks.GB News linksAlong with Nigel Farage, Lee Anderson and several MPs on the right flank of the Tory party, Tice is a regular on the hard-right, culture war-focused TV outlet GB News. There he hosts a programme called “Richard Tice’s Sunday Sermon”, which serves as a platform for him to deliver his political analysis without the interruptions of an interviewer.However, despite the network being a relatively safe space for him in ideological terms, Tice’s appearances aren’t always amicable. A recent interview with host Andrew Pierce, a longtime right-wing commentator, saw him challenged fiercely about Reform’s chances in a summer election should one be called – with Pierce pointing to the “weirdos” selected by the party to fight numerous seats as evidence the party is “not ready”.Richard Tice, pictured in 2018 at a 'Leave Means Leave' campaign event, is focused on the issue of immigration. (Steve Finn/WENN)Tice was also involved in an incident that saw the network deemed in breach of broadcasting regulator Ofcom’s impartiality regulations, specifically an interview in which a former Brexit Party MEP failed to “sufficiently challenge” his views on immigration.The regulator is under increasing pressure to crack down on GB News heading into the election, with critics arguing it cannot be allowed to broadcast shows that feature Tory and Reform MPs interviewing each other without alternative points of view represented.Tice on NHSThe state and future of the NHS set to be one of this election’s main battlegrounds, and Reform’s key health policy is to spend £17 billion on the NHS on top of its current budget in an effort to get waiting lists down to zero. It also proposes introducing tax relief on private healthcare – something that has been criticised by opponents as a creeping step towards the privatisation of healthcare writ large.Tice’s stated rationale is that the reason the service is struggling is because the money it needs is being spent on other things that the public do not in fact support. Top of the list is Net Zero, which the party and its predecessors have long decried as a pointless “woke” project.In April, Tice used a press conference to frame the choice starkly. “We have a choice in this country, it seems to me,” he said. “A pretty clear choice. Do we want zero waiting lists in two years, and to keep them there? That is the Reform choice. Or do we want net zero CO2 emissions in 25 years? That is the Labour choice.”Tice on immigrationImmigration is by far Reform UK’s top issue, with the party looking to build on Farage’s two decades of campaigning against it in its legal and illegal forms.As far as the election goes, Tice and the party are targeting the continuing arrival of small boats of people travelling across the English Channel, many of them seeking asylum. He has criticised the government for failing to stop “mass immigration” post-Brexit, and described Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda policy as “a disaster”, arguing on GB News that its supposed deterrent value was revealed to be zero just hours after the House of Commons finally passed the law.Reform chairman Richard Tice (L) and leader Nigel Farage speak at the party's economic policy launch at Church House in London. (Alamy Live News)“Within a matter of hours more boats, absolutely packed full, overfilled with illegal migrants, were setting off from the beaches. And we learnt on Tuesday morning that sadly five people, including a young child, drowned leaving the beaches. That's not a deterrent. That's an absolute disaster.”Instead of deporting people to Rwanda, he is arguing for a “pick up and take back” policy that would see small boat arrivals deposited back on French soil. As evidence that this is both practical and humane, he has cited similar policies deployed in the US and Australia.However, he has not addressed the fact that Australia’s policy has been criticised internationally for leaving so-called “boat people” confined to facilities on the island of Nauru, where there have been incidents of suicide and self-immolation.Tice on cost of living crisisPerhaps unsurprisingly given he is trying to peel away former Tory voters, Tice has criticised recent Tory prime ministers harshly for overseeing Britain’s intense cost of living crisis. In 2022, he accused then-prime minister Boris Johnson of “waffling” over the situation. “Clueless, out of touch, no ideas, no help,” he tweeted. “Shocking.”He has also warned that the prospect of a “disastrous” Labour government will offer no prospect of meaningful relief for struggling households.Instead, Reform proposes lifting the minimum level of income tax to £20,000 while cutting various other taxes – among them fuel duty, another gesture to the party’s rejection of environmentalism as a top priority."
Yahoo News UK,The Tory ministers and 'big beasts' who could lose MP seats in the electionSeveral big names in the Conservative Party are at risk of losing their seats in the general election.,"['Grant Shapps', 'Penny Mordaunt', 'Liz Truss', 'Jacob Rees-Mogg', 'Johnny Mercer', 'Victoria Prentis', 'Alex Chalk', 'David TC Davies']",Andy Wells,Updated 20 June 2024 at 3:51 pm·5-min read,20,June,2024,03:51:00,5,"Rishi Sunak could become the first prime minister to lose his seat in a general election, according to new bombshell polling.According to the Savanta poll, which was commissioned by The Telegraph, the Conservatives are projected to win just 53 seats in the general election. Some three-quarters of the Cabinet would lose their seats in that scenario – including Sunak.Were Sunak to lose his seat in Richmond (Yorks), it would make him the first prime minister in history to lose their seat in a general election, according to the Institute for Government. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is also facing a battle to hold on to his constituency, with the vote on a “knife edge”.Savanta spoke to around 18,000 people between 7 June and 18 June for their poll. If reflected in the election, Labour would be on course to win 516 seats, with a commanding Commons majority of 382. The Liberal Democrats would have nearly as many seats (50) as the Tories.Jeremy Hunt: My constituency is on a knife edgeHunt could be among the Conservative casualties on the night of the 4 July poll, despite his newly-created seat in Godalming and Ash currently holding a Conservative majority of more than 10,000. He is facing a battle to win the seat in Surrey, with the Liberal Democrats keen on taking a high-profile scalp.Several other Tory ‘big beasts’ also face a tight vote to hold onto their seat, according to a major poll by Ipsos.Grant ShappsDefence secretary Grant Shapps may lose his seat in the election. (Getty)Defence secretary Grant Shapps, who had been touted as a potential leader of the Conservatives after the election, is at risk of losing his Welwyn Hatfield seat, according to Ipsos. Their polling suggests a likely Labour victory, with Sir Keir Starmer’s party currently on 48%, compared to 28% for the Conservatives.Shapps won the seat in the 2019 election with a vote share of 52.6%, increasing his majority from the previous election.Penny MordauntPenny Mordaunt’s seat is at risk from Labour. (PA)Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons, is another Tory MP whose name has been mentioned in a future leadership contest – in the event of the Tories losing the election. However, she may not even be an MP after 4 July as her Portsmouth North seat is at risk.Seen as “leaning Labour”, polling suggests Labour are on 42%, compared to the Tories on 34%. She won 61.4% of the vote in the 2019 election.Liz TrussFormer prime minister Liz Truss may not be an MP after the election. (PA)Former prime minister Liz Truss is at risk in her South West Norfolk seat. The seat is seen as a “toss up”, with Truss currently in the lead at 31%. Labour are a sitting at 27% but Reform UK are polling 30%.Allowing for margins of error and another two weeks of campaigning, the seat will be hotly contested between all three parties on 4 July.Jacob Rees-MoggJacob Rees-Mogg is on track to lose his seat at the general election. (PA)While no longer a government minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg losing his North East Somerset and Hanham seat would perhaps be one of the night’s bigger surprises. Rees-Mogg has been an outspoken critic of some of Sunak’s policies and is a regular presenter on GB News.However, the Ipsos poll has the seat, which has been newly-created for the 2024 election, is currently showing a “likely Labour” win, with the party on 47%, compared to 30% for the Conservatives.Johnny MercerPolling suggests Johnny Mercer will lose his seat to Labour at the election. (PA)Veterans’ affairs secretary Johnny Mercer is standing for the Plymouth Moor View seat, having last won the seat in 2019 with an increased vote share of 60.7%. However, a “likely” Labour win is expected, with a projected vote share of 49% on 4 July. The Tories are currently polling at 30% – half of what they won in 2019.Victoria PrentisAttorney general Victoria Prentis is currently facing being replaced by Labour in the election. (PA)A “likely” Labour victory is predicted for Banbury, a seat currently held by attorney general Victoria Prentis. The Tories are polling at 30% in the constituency, compared to 40% for Labour. Prentis is notable for being the first British MP to take a Ukrainian refugee in her house following Russia’s invasion.Alex ChalkThe Libreal Democrats are projected to take over justice secretary Alex Chalk’s seat. (Alamy)Justice secretary Alex Chalk won 48% of the vote in the Cheltenham constituency in the 2019 election. However, the seat is now leaning to being “strong Liberal Democrat”, with Sir Ed Davey’s party polling 60% of the vote.

The term is also sometimes used to refer to the election itself, as in ‘they could not win at the ballot box’.CampaignThe time before an election in which politicians persuade people to vote for them. In the case of the 2024 election in the UK, parliament was dissolved on the 30 May and the election will take place on 4 July.CanvassingGoing round a particular area trying to persuade people to vote for one party or the other.In UK elections, this is often done by volunteers knocking on people’s doors.Capital gains taxCapital gains tax is a tax on profit when people sell assets that have increased in value.In the 2024 election, the Conservatives have promised that landlords who sell to sitting tenants will be spared capital gains tax on the proceeds, while Labour has left the door open to raising capital gains.Child benefitChild benefit is a benefit paid to parents with children under 16 (or under 20 in approved education or training).The Conservatives have promised to increase the threshold at which high earners start to lose the benefit from £60,000 to £120,000.Sir Keir Starmer, like the Conservatives, has pledged not to raise VAT. (Photo by Stefan Rousseau/PA Images via Getty Images)CoalitionA coalition government is a government formed jointly by more than one political party (for example, by the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives in 2010).ConstituencyThe geographical area that is represented by each MP in the House of Commons.ECHRThe European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is an international convention which protects human rights in Europe.The Conservative manifesto stopped short of promising to withdraw from the ECHR, which would have made plans such as the plan to deport migrants to Rwanda easier.Exit pollA poll conducted outside polling stations just after people have voted on election day.On election day, the results of Britain’s exit poll are published just after polls close at 10pm and tend to give a more accurate prediction of the result than previous polls produced throughout the campaign.First past the postThe first past the post system is used to elect MPs to the House of Commons.The candidate with the most votes in each constituency becomes MP, and the party with the most MPs becomes the government.This can mean that the winning party actually has a minority of votes cast: in 2019, the Conservatives had 43.6% of the vote.Hung parliamentA hung parliament is where no party has enough seats to form an overall majority. For example, both the 2010 election and 2017 elections resulted in hung parliament.In 2010, the Conservatives formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, while in 2017, the Conservatives formed a minority government with a 'confidence and supply' agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).Income tax thresholdThe thresholds between the tax-free allowance, basic rate tax and higher rates of tax.Both parties have said they will continue the freeze on income tax thresholds brought in under the Conservatives, which means people pay more tax as more and more people are pushed into higher tax brackets if wages rise.MajorityA party with a majority – more than half of the seats in the House of Commons – has won the election.The number of votes by which an individual MP wins a constituency is also referred to as their majority.ManifestoPolitical parties publish manifestos before a general election, with a set of policies that the party stands for and aims to implement if elected.Manifesto pledges are not legally binding.Marginal seatA seat in which the incumbent MP won by a small majority, meaning a swing is more likely than in a so-called ‘safe seat’ where the MP had a large majority.Net zeroThe UK Government has set a goal for Britain’s emissions to reach net zero – where emission and removal of greenhouse gases reaches equilibrium – by 2050.All major parties are expected to stick to this goal, barring Reform UK.Opinion pollAn opinion poll is a research survey (usually carried out on a representative sample of the electorate) to gauge likely results in an election.Poll‘The polls’ refers to the places where people vote in an election: exit polls and opinion polls refer to two kinds of survey used to predict election results.Postal voteAn absentee vote where the vote is sent in by post.At the 2019 general election, 17.2% of voters across the UK used a postal ballot.Proxy voteA vote where a person who can’t make it to the booth appoints someone to vote for them.In the 2019 election, 0.6% of voters appointed a proxy.PsephologyPsephology is the scientific study of elections and voting and is used to predict and analyse election results.Polling dayThe day when the country places their vote: in the UK 2024 election, this is July 4.PurdahBefore British elections, the country enters purdah, officially known as the ‘pre-election period of sensitivity’.Purdah means that politicians (both local and national) and other people such as civil servants face restrictions on what they can do and announce.Ministers who remain in office can’t announce new funding, or new policies, or anything which might sway voters or make the government more popular.The idea is that public money cannot be spent on the election.Spoiled ballotA ballot paper which has been marked wrongly (for instance with a vote for more than one candidate) will not be counted.Sometimes people spoil ballots deliberately as a protest vote to show dissatisfactionSwing‘Swing’ is the change in voter support for a political party between one election and the next.It is used to analyse the performance of parties in different areas.Tax burdenThe tax burden refers to the total amount of taxes paid by a group (in this case the UK as a whole) as a proportion of total income.The tax burden is currently at its highest in 70 years according to the OECD.The Equality ActThe 2010 Equality Act protects people against discrimination in Britain.The Conservatives want to ‘tweak’ the Act so that sex-based protections only apply on the basis of someone’s biological sex.Triple lockThe triple lock is a guarantee introduced to the state pension in 2010 so it would not lose value in real terms.The guarantee means that the state pension will rise by the highest out of average earnings, inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) or 2.5%.Triple lock plusThe ‘triple lock plus’ is a Conservative policy, which would see the tax-free pension allowance rise every year in line with the triple lock of average wages, inflation, or 2.5% – whichever is highest, to prevent pensioners being pulled into paying income tax.TurnoutTurnout refers to the percentage of people eligible to vote who turn out to vote on election day.In the 2019 election, for example, 67.3% of those eligible turned out to vote.VATValue added tax is added to goods and services sold by VAT-registered companies, and is the third-largest source of government income after income tax and national insurance.Both Labour and the Conservatives have pledged not to raise VAT.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

The Telegraph,Rishi Sunak’s Facebook page has not put a single new ad out since May,[],Dominic Penna,25 June 2024 at 7:01 pm·4-min read,25,June,2024,07:01:00,4,"Rishi Sunak’s Facebook page has not put a single paid advert out since the end of May, in contrast to those of Sir Keir Starmer and Nigel Farage.No new campaigns have appeared in the Prime Minister’s name on the social media giant since a two-minute montage promoted in the week after he called the general election.The film, which showed Mr Sunak touring the country and making his rain-soaked Downing Street speech, was seen by more than one million Facebook users at a cost of between £10,000 and £15,000.It stopped appearing on newsfeeds on May 30 and there have been no such clips since, while the Tory leader’s popularity has continued to slide amid a campaign hit by a number of political mis-steps.Scarlett Maguire of JL Partners, the polling firm, said: “Initially, the Conservatives wanted to run a presidential campaign because they were quite confident that Keir Starmer is a weak candidate, and in some senses the data justified this.“Before the campaign got underway, the public were not sold on Keir Starmer – he underperformed his party and people in focus groups had a lot of hesitations about him. However, I think what they failed to take into account is just how unpopular Rishi is with the public.“Even before he called the general election he was the most unpopular prime minister by historic comparisons this far into his term and this close to an election. Keir Starmer has actually slightly increased his lead on crucial questions like who would make the best prime minister.“People seem to be warming up to him a little bit as it becomes more likely he’ll become prime minister, whereas the two things that have really cut through from the Conservative campaign side have been D-Day and gamble-gate – two things that have only undermined Rishi Sunak’s standing with the public.”A YouGov poll this week found Mr Sunak’s net approval rating has fallen to a historic low – meaning he is now more unpopular than Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn at their nadirs.Sir Keir’s facebook page spent £36,077 on 1,070 different sponsored posts reaching people in the past seven days, while Mr Farage’s spent £5,619 across 18 adverts.Posts that the Labour leader has promoted include the party’s most recent election broadcast, in which he takes a walk in the Lake District with Gary Neville, pundit and former England defender.Mr Farage’s posts group Sir Keir and Mr Sunak together, accusing them both of offering “the highest taxes in 70 years” and “one migrant every minute” in contrast to Reform’s pledges to freeze non-essential immigration and raise the income tax threshold to £20,000 from its current rate of £12,500.Analysis of Facebook’s ad library shows Conservative adverts in recent weeks have focused heavily on attacking Sir Keir and his party’s past record on tax and pensions, rather than promoting Mr Sunak or members of his Cabinet.By contrast, sponsored Labour videos include a host of frontbench figures. As well as Sir Keir featuring prominently, Angela Rayner, his deputy, and Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, are seen delivering bespoke messages to voters about party policies.Adverts targeting voters in London also make use of Sadiq Khan, the Labour Mayor of London, who was re-elected to a historic third term in City Hall last month.Mr Khan said in his video that voting Labour would “break down barriers to opportunity” and resolve the cost-of-living crisis.Appearing to acknowledge voters deserting the party over issues like the Israel-Hamas conflict, which was evidenced by the recent local elections, he added: “If you vote for any other candidate or party in this election, then you could end up with a Conservative MP and a Conservative government. Don’t risk it, vote Labour.”Meanwhile, three different Tory posts mock Sir Keir up as Lord Kitchener – who was at the centre of Britain’s First World War recruitment drive in 1914 – alongside the caption “Starmer needs you to vote Reform!”It echoes a now-familiar Tory argument that a vote for Mr Farage’s insurgent party will only increase the size of a Labour majority.The Tories have more than quadrupled their spending on older voters as they appeal to the public over their record on pensions. In the past week, six per cent of the party’s Facebook spend was allocated solely towards reaching over-65s, up from 1.3 per cent across the last 30 days.The advert in question reads: “Remember when Labour increased the state pension by only 75p? Don’t risk your pension with Labour. Only the Conservatives will protect it.”The Conservatives and Reform have outspent Labour in their Facebook advertising, with the social media site playing host to more older voters than Instagram or TikTok.The Conservative Party was contacted for comment."
The Telegraph,"JK Rowling agrees to meet Labour, but sets conditions over labelling of ‘hate groups’","['‘Really happy to talk to JK Rowling’', '‘Everyday injustices and indignities’']",Dominic Penna,25 June 2024 at 3:54 pm·3-min read,25,June,2024,03:54:00,3,"JK Rowling has agreed to meet Labour on the condition that Angela Rayner apologises for endorsing a charter that described two organisations, Woman’s Place and the LGB Alliance, as “hate groups”.At the weekend, the Harry Potter author claimed that Labour had “abandoned” women and she would “struggle to support” Sir Keir Starmer’s party at the general election because of its transgender stance.Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, responded by offering her a meeting to provide “assurances” over the protection of women-only spaces.Responding to Ms Reeves’ remarks, Ms Rowling said: “I’ll be happy to meet after Keep Prisons Single Sex, Lesbian Labour, Women’s Rights Network, Woman’s Place and the LGB Alliance have been given in-person meetings with the Labour leadership.“I’d also like to know whether Angela Rayner still considers the last two organisations hate groups – asking on behalf of female survivors of domestic violence and gay people who don’t subscribe to gender identity ideology.”‘Really happy to talk to JK Rowling’When Ms Rayner stood to become Labour’s deputy leader in 2020, she backed a charter calling Woman’s Place UK, which campaigns for women-only rape refuges, and the LGB Alliance, set up in response to Stonewall’s stance on trans issues, “trans-exclusionist hate groups”.Ms Rayner’s spokesman refused to apologise for her comments in April after the publication of the Cass Review into the treatment of children with gender issues.The report concluded that much of the evidence for the use of medicine including puberty blockers was “shaky” and that such drugs should be treated with extreme caution.The fresh row involving Rowling comes despite Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, strengthening his position on transgender issues to agree with Sir Tony Blair that a woman has a vagina and a man has a penis.Sir Keir said in 2021 it was “not right” for Rosie Duffield, a Labour MP who has stressed the importance of biological sex, to say that only women have a cervix.In an article for The Times on Saturday, Rowling said she had a “poor opinion” of Sir Keir’s character, claiming he was “dismissive and often offensive” in respect of women’s concerns about their sex-based rights.On Monday, Ms Reeves said that she would be “really happy to talk to JK Rowling” to give the author “assurances” about the Equality Act.“For me, those protections whether it is about prisons, refuges, changing spaces, that is really important to me, it is really important to the Labour Party that those single sex spaces based on biological sex are protected,” said the shadow chancellor. “And nothing in our plans goes contrary to that, nothing at all.”‘Everyday injustices and indignities’Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, told Times Radio he had been left “pretty depressed” by Ms Rowling’s comments, saying transgender women had been “beaten up by headlines”, while gender-critical campaigners felt “silenced”.“When women like JK Rowling do speak up, I think it’s important we engage seriously with the arguments that she’s making, with the concerns that she has,” he said.“And also we listen to what trans people are saying about the everyday injustices and indignities that they’re experiencing too, whether that’s hate crime or poor provision in public services.”In its election manifesto, Labour has committed to making it easier for people to legally change gender, which has prompted Tory warnings about loopholes for sexual predators.Sir Keir’s party would overhaul the existing process, which it claims is outdated, to replace the need to provide two years of proof before changing gender, with a cooling off period of the same timeframe.Labour would also scrap a panel of doctors and lawyers that currently approves gender-recognition certificates, instead allowing one specialist doctor to sign off applications."

The leaders did not go head to head and instead were given 30-minute slots to answer audience questions.The debate announcements were confirmed after the Tories had pressed Sir Keir to take part in a record six debates during the six-week election countdown.Conservative sources had dubbed the opposition leader “the knight that won’t fight” and “Sir Fear Starmer” after he failed to sign up to their weekly debate demand.Labour headquarters indicated instead that their leader would take part in two head-to-head debates against Mr Sunak, matching what Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn did ahead of the 2019 election.What channels are the debates on?The BBC, ITV and Sky News have hosted debates in an array of formats in the race to the general election.All broadcasts from the BBC are available on BBC1, BBC News and are live on the corporation’s streaming platforms BBC Iplayer.The BBC also confirmed they will air several debates on local radio.ITV will show their programmes on their main channel ITV1, as well as their steaming service ITVX. For those watching from Scotland, the ITV debates will be on the equivalent channel STV.Elsewhere, Sky News will air their broadcast on Freeview and stream the action on their website and social media channels. Each platform has also streamed the programmes like on Youtube.The Telegraph will be providing live coverage of all the debates with expert analysis and reaction.Will the debates clash with any football fixtures?There have been several clashes between debate timings and football fixtures – an inevitability with the jam-packed TV schedules.Football fans and politics watchers were torn on June 7, when the BBC’s debate with the seven parties coincided with England’s international warm-up with Iceland on Channel 4.England played Denmark the same day as the BBC’s Question Time special, but at an earlier kick-off time of 5pm meant the match had finished before the election programme at 8pm.When is the general election?The general election will take place on July 4 as the country heads to the polls between 7am and 10pm to have their say over the next prime minister.It was confirmed by Rishi Sunak in a rain-sodden speech outside of Downing Street on May 22 that the election would happen six weeks later. Both the Prime Minister and other party leaders have been on the campaign trail since then in a bid to win over voters through measures such as the TV debates."
The Telegraph,"Sunak looks like Major in run-up to 1997 Labour landslide, suggests Kwarteng",[],Daniel Martin,25 June 2024 at 8:00 pm·3-min read,25,June,2024,08:00:00,3,"Rishi Sunak looks like Sir John Major in the run-up to the 1997 general election when “everyone knew what the result would be”, Kwasi Kwarteng has suggested.Mr Kwarteng, a former chancellor, said this year’s election campaign reminded him of the period before Sir Tony Blair’s New Labour landslide.The senior Tory – who is not standing at the election – said there “could still be surprises” ahead of polling day on July 4, but believed that “you can see where the thing is going”.Mr Kwarteng also admitted that he felt “partially responsible” for the Conservative Party’s dire position in the polls, but said Mr Sunak must take most of the blame.It was suggested to him during an interview on GB News that the Prime Minister was campaigning every day despite knowing he was not going to win.He replied: “I think it is very difficult for him, for any prime minister. The only thing I can remember which is similar was 1997, when you kind of knew that Labour would get in. I think John Major and the Cabinet, they looked pretty tired and they were going out to campaign and everyone knew what the result would be.“It feels a bit like that this year. There could still be surprises – we don’t know. But at the moment, when you have got Cabinet ministers warning about Labour ‘super majorities’, I think Jeremy Hunt and Grant Shapps have mentioned that, you can see where the thing is going.”The former chancellor claimed Mr Sunak and others in the Tory party also needed to shoulder the blame for the Conservatives being so far behind Labour.He said the Prime Minister was to blame for leaving the D-Day ceremony early and for not having dealt with the threat of Reform UK, and claimed the decision to call an election early, as well as the betting scandal, were also contributing to the party’s woes.Two MPs and two party staffers are under investigation for allegedly placing bets on a July election before it was announced, using insider knowledge.Mr Kwarteng delivered Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-Budget in September 2022, which spooked the markets by making unfunded tax cuts. It sparked a rise in interest rates that ultimately led to a chaotic end of her premiership the following month.The Tories’ opinion poll ratings also tanked during this time and, asked whether he felt responsible for the Tories’ current position, he told GB News: “I feel partially responsible – but I don’t feel responsible for leaving D-Day early, I don’t feel responsible for the Reform party, which was on four per cent in October 2022, being on nearly 20 per cent now.“I don’t feel responsible for the election betting scandal, nor do I feel responsible for the fact that this election has happened way before anyone was expecting it.”"
Evening Standard,Betting rule-breakers 'should be booted out of Tory party' Sunak vows as Starmer grilled on Corbyn,[],Miriam Burrell,25 June 2024 at 3:41 am·4-min read,25,June,2024,03:41:00,4,"Rishi Sunak has insisted that anyone in the Conservative Party who is found to have broken betting laws should be “booted out” and “face the full consequences of the law”.During a live Q&A with The Sun readers, hosted by Harry Cole on Monday night, the Prime Minister was grilled on his handling of the election date betting scandal that has rocked the Tory party’s election campaign while Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer was asked how he could be trusted after he was “happy to lie to us” about Jeremy Corbyn.Mr Sunak reiterated that the party was conducting an internal investigation alongside the Gambling Commission probe.The Prime Minister said: “I’m incredibly angry about this and the right thing to do...is to get to the bottom of what happened, to investigate things thoroughly.“Now we have to do that separately to the Gambling Commission, who don’t report to me. I don’t have the details of their investigation. We have to do that sensitively and carefully so that we don’t compromise the integrity of a police and other investigations.“But let me be clear, if we come across findings or information that warrants it, we will not hesitate to act, I have been crystal clear that I will hold people to account, whoever they are.”Mr Sunak added that anyone who has broken rules should be “booted out of the Conservative Party” and “should face the full consequences of the law”.Rishi Sunak shake hands with members of the audience after making a speech at an event at Petyt Hall (Stefan Rousseau/PA Wire)But he said it is “proper” to wait for the outcome of multiple investigations before taking action.The Gambling Commission, the police and the Conservative Party are all understood to be looking into claims that several figures with links to the Tories or Number 10 placed bets on the date of the General Election shortly before Mr Sunak announced his plans last month.Those include Mr Sunak’s former parliamentary aide Craig Williams, who has already admitted to having “a flutter” on the election date in what he told the BBC was a “huge error of judgment”.The party’s chief data officer, Nick Mason, and campaigning director, Tony Lee, have both taken leaves of absence after being implicated in the scandal, while Mr Lee’s wife, Tory candidate Laura Saunders, is also under investigation by the Gambling Commission.Mr Sunak was also grilled on immigration, housing and NHS wait times during the Q&A.He claimed migrants are “queuing up in Calais” waiting for a Labour government so they can come to the UK.He also defended his record on cutting down net migration, claiming that the number of visas accepted by the Home Office this year had dropped by 30 per cent.Mr Sunak added: “If you look at the forecast, independent forecasts, not mine, we’re forecast to halve net migration in 12 months because of the measures that I’ve already taken, by the way the Labour Party opposed all of those, and I want to go further.”To wrap up, an animated Mr Sunak said: “I’m not going to pretend we got everything right. I know the last few years have been particualry frustrating.“But I’m not going to sit here and say the last 14 years hasn’t made the country a better place.”He added: “If you want taxes cut... and action on legal migration and stopping the boats... I’m the only person who is going to deliver that for you.”Meanwhile an audience member said that when Sir Keir backed Mr Corbyn in 2019 and now justified it by saying he did not believe the then-Labour leader would win that election, “that means you’re happy to lie to us – how do we know you’re not lying now?”Sir Keir listed his track record of transforming the Northern Ireland police service and the Crown Prosecution Service in response.“What I’m asking for now is the opportunity to pick the country up, which is as broken as my party was in 2019, and change it for the better,” the Labour leader said.Sir Keir Starmer meeting Labour supporters during a visit to Northampton Town Football Club (Jacob King/PA Wire)Sir Keir also claimed that the backlog of asylum claims would double by the end of the year to 100,000 if the Conservatives are re-elected.“There are 50,000 people not being processed, if we carry on with Rishi Sunak as prime minister it will get to 100k by the end of the year,” the Labour leader said.Sir Keir vowed to crack down on people smuggling gangs with a border security command with counter terrorism powers.“I know how it’s done and I think it can be done again,” he said.He claimed the number of people being deported from the UK has dropped by 44 per cent under the current Government.He said if Labour came into power, he would put staff back in the Home Office returns unit and return people “back to countries where they came from”.He added that Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda plan was an “expensive gimmick”."

Stefan Rousseau - PA Images via Getty ImagesKeir Starmer has admitted his children are “worried” about what the impact will be on their lives of him becoming prime minister.The Labour leader, who has a 13-year-old daughter and a 16-year-old son, said he and his wife Victoria “will fiercely protect their privacy” if he makes it to No.10.Every opinion is predicting that Starmer is set to become PM with a massive Commons majority as the Tory election campaign goes from bad to worse.On ITV’s This Morning, presenter Ben Shephard asked him how his children feel about the prospect of their dad becoming prime minister.“How do they feel about the fact that their life could significantly change?” he said.Starmer replied: “We’ve got to get it over the line, but they’re worried, if I’m honest.“They are worried about it because, and I think every parent will understand this, if you’re a teenage child, you don’t want things to change. You’ve got things set up at home exactly as you want them, you’ve got your friends, you’ve got your routines and you’ve got your first little bits of independence. What are you doing after school, it may not be a big thing but you can do what you want with your friends after school.“All of that, I can see deep down they’re worried this could change, which is why we will fiercely protect their privacy and ensure that they are able to continue doing that.”He added: “I wouldn’t be being straight with you if I didn’t say I’m worried about the impact and inside I think they are.”The Labour leader also revealed that his family will move from their home in North London to Downing Street if he wins the election.Related...'Why Are You Behind Farage On This?': Keir Starmer Criticised Over Refusal To Scrap Two Child Cap‘There Are Bigger Things To Come’: How Keir Starmer Plans To Make Life Better From Day One Of A Labour Government'We Want To Be A Party Of Power': Keir Starmer Slaps Down Heckler At Labour Manifesto Launch"
Evening Standard,"Shoplifting 'epidemic' in London as offences soar almost 80% in three years, warn Liberal Democrats",[],Rachael Burford,25 June 2024 at 6:33 pm·2-min read,25,June,2024,06:33:00,2,"Shoplifting has become an “epidemic” in London, the Liberal Democrats warned on Tuesday as it was revealed offences had increased almost 80 per cent in three years.Less than one in five reports of the crime were attended by an officer last year, shocking Met Police data shows.In 2021 there were 30,109 cases of shoplifting reported to the force. This rose to a staggering 54,161 cases in 2023.Shopkeepers have warned how their profits are being hit by people targeting their stores to steal goods. Last year 35,000 reports received no visit from a police officer, data obtained in a Freedom of Information request from the Liberal Democrats shows.The party said it would invest an extra £170 million into frontline policing over the course of the next Parliament - a move paid for by savings from abolishing Police and Crime Commissioners.Liberal Democrat candidate for Carshalton and Wallington, Bobby Dean said: “The Conservatives have sat on their hands while shopkeepers across London are left to face a growing shoplifting epidemic.”He stressed that the capital needed more “bobbies back on the beat” with the resources to properly investigate all crimes.“That is why the Liberal Democrats are calling for an extra £170m to be invested in frontline policing across the country. Only that way we can get back to proper community policing to help bring criminals to justice,” he added.Carshalton and Wallington is one of three Lib-Dem target seats in south west London, alongside Wimbledon, and Sutton and Cheam.The Evening Standard has drawn up an interactive map of the key contests in the capital, as well as all the other constituencies.The Tories are pledging to recruit 8,000 more full-time, fully warranted police officers to “ensure a new police officer for every neighbourhood”, as well as making more use of facial recognition technology to catch law breakers.Labour has promised to “restore neighbourhood policing with thousands of extra officers” who would be “equipped with the powers they need”.The number of shoplifting offences recorded by police in England and Wales has risen to the highest level in 20 years.A total of 430,104 offences were logged by forces last year, up more than a third (37 per cent) on the 315,040 recorded in the previous 12 months to December 2022."
The Independent,John Oliver’s ‘hilarious’ general election tirade will stream in the UK despite censorship fears,[],Annabel Nugent,25 June 2024 at 8:30 pm·2-min read,25,June,2024,08:30:00,2,"John Oliver’s on-air tirade about the general election will be available to watch in the UK, Sky has confirmed amid concerns from British viewers.No political party was spared in the latest episode of Oliver’s late-night talk show, which sees the Birmingham-born comedian monologue about the forthcoming general election. Moments from the segment have been praised as “hilarious” by fans after going viral on social media.When Sky Comedy did not broadcast the latest episode of HBO’s Last Week Tonight in its usual Monday night slot yesterday (24 June), British viewers became worried that the instalment would not be made available to watch due to broadcaster regulations.Strict impartiality rules prevented Sky from airing the episode on TV, but fans will be relieved to hear that the episode will be available to stream online later on Tuesday (25 June).The episode will be available in full, with Oliver’s 30-minute segment on the election intact, a Sky source told Deadline.The reason for this is because video-on-demand content is not as tightly regulated as TV in the UK.Although the episode sees Oliver mock parties across the political spectrum, he reserves particular ire for Rishi Sunak’s Conservative party as he tells viewers that the 4 July election is an opportunity to tell the “c***s, f***pigs and weirdos” to “f*** off into the sun”.“If we do this, 4 July will no longer be known as just an American holiday,” he said.(HBO)Referring to the last 14 years of Tory rule, the 47-year-old quipped: “If a wild badger broke into your home and f***ed everything up for 14 years straight, tearing absolutely everything apart, you would think, ‘OK, you know what, we’ll worry about redecorating choices later. Right now, that badger needs to f***ing go.’”Elsewhere, he took a swipe at Labour leader Keir Starmer, stating: “Fun fact about Keir, there aren’t any”.(HBO / Sky / PA)"
Yahoo News UK,"Three important UK election issues, explainedRishi Sunak said his leadership is needed in 'uncertain' times. Keir Starmer said the country needs to be 'rebuilt'. So what issues do voters care about most?","['The economy', 'Health', 'Immigration and asylum']",James Cheng-Morris,Updated 28 May 2024 at 11:11 pm·5-min read,28,May,2024,11:11:00,5,"After months of speculation, Rishi Sunak confirmed the general election will be held on 4 July.The prime minister said Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer could not be trusted to lead the country through “uncertain” times. He made the economy and combating global security the key elements of his pitch to the nation as he announced the election date.In response, Starmer told voters: “Together we can stop the chaos, we can turn the page, we can start to rebuild Britain.”But amid this “uncertainty” and need to “rebuild”, what do the voters consider the key issues?This chart, produced using YouGov polling over the course of this parliament, offers an insight in the issues voters care most about and how that has ebbed and flowed over time.Compared to when Boris Johnson's Tories won the December 2019 poll, the economy, immigration, defence and tax have grown in importance in the eyes of the electorate. This has come amid the cost of living crisis; small boats crossing the English Channel; the onset of the Ukraine war and wider global instability; and the highest tax burden in 70 years.Housing has also become a bigger concern, with the Renters Reform Bill - in which the government pledged to scrap no-fault evictions - having been paused after Sunak called the election.Meanwhile, the last general election was fought - and won by the Tories - on a single issue: Brexit. Yet the chart shows a clear downturn in its relevance among voters, particularly after a trade deal was agreed with the EU in December 2020.This next chart, meanwhile, highlights what voters have considered the top issues over the past year. By a wide margin, the top three are the economy, health and immigration and asylum.Here, Yahoo News UK breaks down what is behind these issues and how they have ebbed and flowed in importance among voters since the last election in 2019.The economyThe unprecedented lockdown called by Boris Johnson in March 2020 meant the public’s attention shifted to the economy, as demonstrated by the huge spike in the chart above. The then-chancellor Rishi Sunak was forced to implement a £70bn furlough scheme, lasting 18 months, to protect people’s jobs.There was a second almighty economic shock - and rise in public concern - in February 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This caused a further spike in an already turbulent wholesale energy market, driving up costs for suppliers and ultimately customers.Average energy bills eventually reached £2,500 a year (and would have exceeded £4,000 had the government not intervened). This was double the £1,278 consumers were paying before the war and by the time this election takes place, people will still be paying much more than this: £1,568.Energy prices were also a key driver in inflation reaching 11.1% - a 41-year high - by October 2022, though it has since fallen to 2.3%, which is near the Bank of England’s 2.0% target.The third economic shock of this parliament - and most damaging for the Tories - was in October 2022 when Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng's disastrous “mini budget”, containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, prompted an economic crisis. It led to soaring interest rates, and to this day homeowners who are remortgaging are facing significantly higher bills.HealthHealth, like the economy, is another issue which clearly correlated with the beginning of the pandemic. The above chart shows an enormous spike in public concern when COVID cases started to multiply in March 2020, ultimately leading to the nationwide lockdown as the NHS faced collapse.Cases fell that summer, but spikes in the chart can be seen once infections rose again and fresh nationwide lockdowns were imposed in October 2020 and January 2021. By March 2022, likely as concerns over the Omicron variant faded, there was much less concern about health.In January last year, there was a brief spike as the NHS in England experienced the biggest industrial action in its history, with tens of thousands of nurses and ambulance staff walking out simultaneously.As for the state of play going into the election, NHS waiting lists remain higher than they were when Sunak vowed to cut them last year. According to the latest figures, an estimated 7.54 million treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of March, relating to 6.29 million patients.Immigration and asylumSince the last election, the immigration and asylum narrative has largely revolved around one issue: small boats crossing the English Channel.The numbers have risen in most of the intervening years: there were 1,843 crossings in 2019, 8,466 in 2020, 28,526 in 2021, 45,774 in 2022 and 29,437 last year. This year, the number has already passed the 10,000 mark.The regular sharp spikes in the above chart demonstrate how frequently crossings have been in the news, including some occasions when hundreds of migrants have made the dangerous journey in a single day.But it also reflects how the government has made this part of its own agenda. It was Boris Johnson’s government which first announced plans to deport migrants to Rwanda in April 2022. That policy was picked up by Rishi Sunak when he became prime minister in October that year, with Sunak since repeating his pledge to “stop the boats”.But after calling the election, Sunak admitted this week that flights would not take off before the country goes to the polls.Read moreFive important laws that could be dropped due to Sunak's snap election (Yahoo News UK)OPINION - Rishi Sunak has been in last-ditch campaign mode for so long — a General Election is logical (Evening Standard)Door open for Boris Johnson to campaign for Tories, Rishi Sunak signals (PA Media)"
The Telegraph,Three big banks slash mortgage rates ahead of election,[],Fran Ivens,25 June 2024 at 4:49 am·3-min read,25,June,2024,04:49:00,3,"Mortgage RatesThree of the UK’s biggest lenders have cut their fixed mortgage rates in the past week in anticipation of interest rate cuts after the election.HSBC has followed Barclays and NatWest to become the latest lender to bring down home loan costs, and more are expected to follow.The bank will cut rates across its residential and buy-to-let loans from Wednesday 26 June.On Monday, Barclays announced rate cuts of up to 0.31 percentage points for home buyers.Last week, the Bank of England held its Bank Rate at 5.25pc for the seventh time despite inflation falling to its target of 2pc in May.The drop has raised hopes that the central bank will make its first cut as early as August and bring down the cost of borrowing, with some analysts suggesting the Bank was unlikely to drop its rate during an election period.ADVERTISEMENTJeremy Batstone-Carr, european strategist at Raymond James Investment Services said: “The general election precludes the Bank from making moves that could signify political favour.  Once the new Parliament is seated and a new budget is delivered, the trajectory for monetary policy will be made clearer.“That being said, it is clear that a rate cut is on the horizon and, assuming inflationary pressures remain eased, it is likely there may be more than one.”The Bank Rate has sat at its current level, a 16-year high, since autumn last year in an ongoing bid to tackle inflation that peaked at 11.1pc in October 2022.Nicholas Mendes of broker John Charcol said: “We can anticipate that lenders will escalate their strategies significantly over the next few weeks.“Following last week’s Monetary Policy Committee decision and with important wage data and general election results on the horizon, markets are likely to anticipate further reductions in bank rates.”Mendes added that with the five-year SONIA swap rate – the main pricing mechanism for five year fixed rate mortgages – at 3.82pc there is space for lenders to lower rates from their current levels.Story continuesThe average interest for a five-year fixed rate mortgage is currently 5.53pc, according to analyst Moneyfacts.It is hoped that news of rate cuts will reinvigorate the property market that has remained sluggish as homeowners and buyers have waited for a fall in loan costs.Managing director of mortgage broker Anderson Harris, Adrian Anderson said: “The property market is historically quieter during the summer months hence lower mortgage rates may help activity in the market and help give buyers some confidence.“There is a lot of pent up demand from buyers ‘waiting to see what happens to mortgage rates’.”There were 5.9 new prospective buyers for every property for sale in May, according to estate agency Knight Frank.  Buyers have only faced less competition once during the last five years, two months after the mini-Budget in December 2022.However, Chris Sykes of Private Finance warns that while cuts may give “some zest” to the summer market, they aren’t significant.“In honesty the drops are not major and we are basically returning to similar rates as to what we had 6-10 weeks ago, so this isn’t at all groundbreaking from a finance point of view. It could keep people waiting and hoping for further rate improvements, that remains to be seen,” he said.Liam O’Hara, head of mortgages at lender First Direct added “The market has a tendency to move quickly and pricing is influenced by a complex range of factors, which means it’s difficult to predict the trajectory of rates in the next few months.“There is no set timeline on rates coming down further so mortgage holders may want to consider making the most of deals while they’re available. Some lenders do allow the transfer of booking fees within a certain period if rates come down more, so it’s also worth checking with your mortgage provider if that’s an option.”"
Yahoo News UK,"Will Nigel Farage's Reform UK 'beat' the Tories in the election?With some polling figures putting the Tories and Reform UK nearly neck and neck, could Farage's party really end up with nearly as many MPs as Sunak's?","['What do the latest polls say?', 'Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?', 'Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?', 'What is proportional representation?']",James Cheng-Morris and  Ellen Manning,Updated 14 June 2024 at 6:33 pm·7-min read,14,June,2024,06:33:00,7,"Leading pollster John Curtice has poured cold water on suggestions that Reform UK is now beating the Conservative Party in the general election polls.As representatives from seven parties took prepared to take part in a TV debate on Thursday, a YouGov survey for The Times newspaper said Reform’s support had increased by two points to 19%, putting them ahead of the Tories for the first time.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage took the the opportunity to hail the poll results in the debate, declaring: “We are now the opposition to Labour.”But Curtice urged caution, insisting that single polls should not be relied on. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""This is one poll - we’ve actually, I think, had four other polls published in the last 24 hours - none of which have had Reform ahead, not even all of which have had Reform gaining ground, but quite a couple of them certainly suggesting it’s also got very close.""He said it may not be the case that Reform are ahead - and could be on average four or five points behind. But he said: ""This is still bad news for the Conservatives. The only way Rishi Sunak can hope to get even to base camp in narrowing the lead that Labour have started off with this campaign was to squeeze the Reform vote.""He added: ""Rather than making progress, things are actually going backwards, not least of course because of Nigel Farage’s decision to fight this campaign.""With many speculating that Reform UK with Farage at the helm could ""beat"" the Tories, Yahoo News UK takes a look.What do the latest polls say?YouGov’s voting intention tracker, updated on Tuesday, suggests the Tories and Reform UK are neck and neck.With Labour well ahead on 38%, the Tories are trailing on 18% – compared to a high of 53% under Boris Johnson in 2020 – with Reform UK just behind on 17% and the Liberal Democrats on 15%.However, there are multiple polls taking place at any one time by a number of different companies.According to the PA news agency, an average of all polls that were carried out wholly or partly during the seven days to June 13 puts Labour on 43%, 21 points ahead of the Conservatives on 22%, followed by Reform on 14%, the Lib Dems on 10% and the Greens on 6%.And while Reform’s average is up one percentage point on the figure for the previous week and the Tories are down one point, there is still an eight-point gap, on average, between the two.Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?Unless something remarkable happens, in short: 'No' - and that's because of the first past the post (FPTP) voting system in which the candidate with the largest number of votes in their constituency is elected.According to the Electoral Reform Society, which is against FPTP, this system leads to a situation where “even if millions of voters support the same party, if they are thinly spread out across the UK they may only get the largest number of votes in a couple of these contests – so only win a few MPs"".“Tens of thousands of voters supporting a different party, but who live near each other, could end up with more MPs. This means the number of MPs a party has in parliament rarely matches their popularity with the public.”Rishi Sunak on the campaign trail on Wednesday. (AFP via Getty Images)Farage knows this well. As the leader of UKIP in the 2015 election, he saw his party win 12.6% of the nationwide vote and one seat. The Liberal Democrats won 7.9% of the vote... and eight seats.Indeed, YouGov last week released a poll – put together using the multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) surveying technique, from a sample size of nearly 60,000 respondents – which suggested the Tories would win just 140 seats, having won 365 in 2019. But this is still 140 more than the zero it projected Reform UK to win, in spite of its strong polling figures.The model had Reform UK ""performing strongly in a number of seats but still a long way off winning in any"", with projected second-placed finishes in 27 constituencies.YouGov's MRP projection. (YouGov)Granted, this model was formed between 24 May and 1 June, before Farage's headline-grabbing intervention on Monday last week in which he announced he would be standing as an MP.But, even as Reform UK polls closer than ever to the Tories, it's difficult to imagine the party winning more than a handful of seats.Chris Hopkins, director at polling firm Savanta, told Yahoo News UK that in one respect, Reform UK is at an advantage compared to Ukip in 2015 because ""Ukip took votes from both Labour and the Conservatives, and we are not seeing that with Reform UK – they are all coming from the Conservatives.""That is the consequence of Rishi Sunak making immigration a centrepiece of the campaign and failing to deliver on it. Even if you have voters that are neutral on immigration, they would say the small boats policy has been a disaster.""But even so, Hopkins said, Reform UK is still ""at a huge electoral disadvantage"" in that its votes are not very concentrated, they are very evenly spread.""There are going to be some races where Reform UK is strong - the Nigel Farage factor in Clacton is really interesting - but realistically its ceiling is five seats: and that’s a high ceiling.""Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey on a campaign visit in Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire, on Wednesday. (PA)Like Reform UK, Sir Ed Davey’s Liberal Democrats are performing well in the polls.In a sign of how defensive the Tory campaign is becoming, one online party advert claims voting for Reform UK or the Lib Dems could give Labour 100 extra seats, resulting in the biggest majority in its history.It depicts a scenario where the Conservatives are beaten into third place behind the Lib Dems, with just 57 seats, despite getting 19% of the vote and without Reform winning a single seat.Read more: Pollsters got it wrong in 2015, so could Labour’s lead be overestimated? (The Guardian)However, it remains unlikely the Lib Dems will finish second. YouGov’s MRP poll projected the party performing strongly, winning 48 seats. This would be up 37 from 2019, but still nowhere near the Tories’ projected 140.However, amid all this talk about projections, it’s worth remembering they are still only polls and not a definite indicator of how people will vote on 4 July. The 1992 and 2015 elections are notable examples of how polling didn’t match the end results of Tory wins.What is proportional representation?Proportional representation, as defined by the UK parliament, is an electoral system ""in which the distribution of seats corresponds closely with the proportion of the total votes cast for each party. For example, if a party gained 40% of the total votes, a perfectly proportional system would allow them to gain 40% of the seats.""This differs from the first past the post system, as set out above, in that a relatively high vote share rarely corresponds with increased seats for the smaller parties. In 2019, for example, the Lib Dems won 11.5% of the vote but only 1.7% – 11 – of the 650 seats.Unsurprisingly, both Reform UK and the Lib Dems support proportional representation.The Lib Dems this week made it part of their manifesto, with the party saying it would introduce the single transferrable vote method, a form of proportional representation which allows electors to rank their preference of candidates on the ballot.The party previously sought to change the UK’s voting system while in the coalition government under then-leader Nick Clegg, but voters rejected the plan in a 2011 referendum.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

The Guardian,Election betting: Tories drop two candidates in major U-turn,[],Rowena Mason and Vikram Dodd,25 June 2024 at 7:34 pm·4-min read,25,June,2024,07:34:00,4,"The Conservative party has finally dropped the two candidates who are under investigation for allegedly placing suspicious bets about the date of the election, after previously standing by them.In a major U-turn, the party said it could no longer support the candidacy of Craig Williams, a parliamentary private secretary to Rishi Sunak standing in Montgomeryshire and Glyndŵr, and Laura Saunders, the candidate for Bristol North West. Saunders is married to the Conservatives’ head of campaigning, Tony Lee, who has taken a leave of absence.The move means their campaigns will no longer be supported and they would not have the Conservative whip if they won the seats. However, the pair are believed not to have had their membership of the party suspended while the Gambling Commission inquiry is continuing.A party spokesperson said: “As a result of ongoing internal inquiries, we have concluded that we can no longer support Craig Williams or Laura Saunders as parliamentary candidates at the forthcoming general election. We have checked with the Gambling Commission that this decision does not compromise the investigation that they are conducting, which is rightly independent and ongoing.”The decision to drop Williams and Saunders is Sunak’s latest effort to draw a line under the gambling scandal that has dogged his election campaign for two weeks.Last week, it was revealed that one of the prime minister’s personal Metropolitan police protection officers had been arrested and questioned over alleged bets on the timing of the general election, using information gained from their role.The information that led to that officer’s arrest for misconduct in public office, came from a Gambling Commission inquiry into the suspicious activity around the placing of bets on the general election date.The Met police has been passed new information by the Gambling Commission suggesting there may be other police officers who placed suspicious bets on the date of the poll.So far, four politicians and officials in the Conservative party are alleged to have been involved in the placing the bets and are being investigated by the commission.Now further questions have been asked about whether further Met officers have been involved in the placing of bets.The latest information from the commission has led the Met to examine if more of its officers may have placed bets using inside information and whether the force needs to take further action.The commission is continuing to work through data and information it has about bets placed on the election dates that may be suspicious.The Met declined to be drawn on the number of officers involved in the new inquiries. A source said it was not clear how many officers the new information related to. The Met said: “We continue to liaise with the Gambling Commission and are assessing information they have provided.”defaultThe Met also hit back at claims in a newspaper, believed to have come from a Conservative source, that the force had leaked details about the Gambling Commission’s inquiry into the Conservatives.Met senior officers are understood to be furious about what they regard as a smear to try to deflect attention away from the Conservatives’ troubles. A Met spokesperson said: “The allegations that the Met has leaked information are simply untrue.”Another source added: “This is a poor distraction technique.”In letter to Pat McFadden, Labour’s national campaign coordinator, the chief executive of the commission, Andrew Rhodes, said it had asked the people it had been in contact with to treat the matter confidentially.But Rhodes also said this confidentiality requirement “does not preclude other activity relating to the fact of an investigation taking place”.The Gambling Commission investigation is into the use of confidential information to place bets, which could amount to cheating, which is a criminal offence.The relevant legislation is section 42 of the 2005 Gambling Act, with the punishment being a fine or a maximum of two years’ imprisonment. Under the legislation a person cheats at gambling if they do “anything for the purpose of enabling or assisting another person to cheat at gambling”.The law also says: “It is immaterial whether a person who cheats improves his chances of winning anything, or wins anything.”"

The polls have consistently painted a very bleak picture for the prime minister, with Labour holding on to a double-digit poll lead over his Conservatives.Recent by-election results suggest that Labour is likely to win a landslide victory – but there’s still time for the PM to turn it around.Here’s everything you need to know about Sunak and what’s he’s saying about the biggest issues in British politics right now.Early lifeSunak was born in Southampton in 1980, the eldest of three children. His Indian parents both arrived from East Africa in the 1960s. A football-mad boy whose childhood idol was Matt Le Tissier, Sunak was described by the family’s neighbours as a child with “lovely manners”.In his youngest years, the PM attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. According to a recent biography, fellow pupil Ollie Case said: “He was someone that was talked about. The teachers would say: ‘He’s going to be prime minister'.""But, growing up in the 1980s and 90s, he also remembers experiencing racism. “My mother was obsessed with us not having accents,” Sunak has said.Rishi Sunak was football-mad as a boy growing up in Southampton. (ITV)Sunak's familySunak is married to Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian entrepreneur and multi-billionaire. The pair first met in 2004 at Stanford University, his future wife apparently attracted to his “honesty and integrity”.Five years later they married in a two-day Indian wedding held in Bangalore. The couple have two daughters, Krishna and Anoushka, who will turn 13 and 11 this year, both of whom are largely kept out of the public eye.Sunak attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. (Rishi Sunak, Instagram)His parentsYashvir Sunak, Rishi’s father, was born in Kenya. He arrived in the UK to study medicine and then stayed, becoming an NHS GP. His mother, Usha, was born in Tanzania and is a pharmacist.The couple met in Britain and settled in Southampton in the 1970s. Usha is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.His educationAs a teenager Sunak studied at Winchester College where he was, he says, a self-confessed “geek”. According to a recent biography, the “naughtiest” thing the prime minister did during his school days “was to smuggle a hand-held television into the school so that he did not miss any key games of Euro 96”.The childhood home of Rishi Sunak in Southampton. (Getty Images, photo taken in 2022)Perhaps unsurprisingly for someone with such an unblemished record, he went on to become the school’s head boy. Sunak worked while studying, delivering medicines for his mother’s pharmacy and as a waiter at a local Indian restaurant.After school, Sunk read philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, graduating in 2001 with a first class degree. While still at university he held an internship at the Conservative Party campaign headquarters and joined the party, but went on studying before entering politics.He earned his MBA from Stanford in 2006 as a Fulbright Scholar, meaning he was selected among the most promising candidates from the UK.How much is he worth?As prime minister, Rishi Sunak earns £80,807 on top of a salary of £84,144 for being an MP. But his current income from Westminster pales in comparison to his family’s vast wealth through marriage.The Sunday Times valued the couple’s joint fortune at £730m. Murty's father is the co-founder of Infosys, an Indian tech conglomerate, in which she holds shares estimated at around £430m. Her family is also involved in a £900m business arrangement with Amazon in India, and she is a shareholder of multiple other companies.Rishi Sunak's mother is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.Before entering politics Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and a series of hedge funds. He is also known to have invested in blind trusts, in which investments are made without holders knowing where the funds are located. These arrangements reportedly hold Sunak’s own multi-million-pound fortune.His religionSunak is not only the first prime minister of colour and of Indian heritage but he is also the first practising Hindu to hold the biggest job in UK politics.He has spoken of his pride in his Hindu faith, saying, “that’s how I was raised, and that’s how I am”. He said: “Having faith gives you resilience, gives you strength that is important and it provides an outlook on life which I find particularly valuable.”Sunak on... the NHSThe prime minister’s biggest challenge in office has been the crisis in the NHS - and to many people in the sector his government has been found wanting. “We have not made enough progress,” Sunak said when asked about his commitment to cut NHS waiting lists during an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV. Asked if that meant he had failed, the prime minister replied: “Yes, we have.""Sunak expects to see waiting lists start to reduce this spring, and blames the delays on “industrial action”, as disputes with junior doctors and consultants over pay and conditions continue. Yet Sunak himself has been blamed for holding up a deal that would prevent more walkouts.Sunak, his wife Akshata and daughters Anoushka and Krishna (second left) at Santa Monica Pier, California, on their summer holiday in 2023. (AP)Sunak on… immigrationAccording to the prime minister, illegal migration threatens to “overwhelm” Europe. In June 2023 he claimed his plan to “stop the boats” and tackle illegal immigration was working, but by August 2023 he had changed his mind: “It’s not an easy problem to fix,” he told broadcasters. “I never said we would be able to solve it overnight.”He has staked much of his reputation on the government's Rwanda Bill - his plan to deport asylum seekers to the east African country that finally became law last month, after months of legal and procedural challenges. It has paved the way for deportation flights to get off the ground within weeks.He described his policy, which he says will act as a deterrent to people traffickers, as being “the will of the people” – yet polling suggests low support for such a punitive approach.The policy, coupled with Conservative talk of limits on legal migration, shows that the government is committed to taking a hard line on the issue, despite the risk of alienating more moderate voters.The Rwanda policy is not universally popular. (YouGov)Sunak on... the cost of living crisisThe prime minister has told hard-pressed working families that they will feel some relief from the cost of living crisis as inflation continues to drop following its highs of October 2022. He described the government’s tax cuts as “meaningful” and has welcomed the dip in mortgage rates at the turn of the year.Sunak says falling inflation will have the biggest impact on family budgets “and will start to ease some of those pressures” and that he was right to focus on that figure. However, the global drop in energy prices is probably the biggest factor in easing the hit on wallets - something that the prime minister has no control over.However, the fall in inflation to 2.3% on 22 May this year – the lowest it has been in nearly three years – was likely one of the key factors in persuading Sunak to call a snap election many weeks earlier than experts had predicted.Can we expect more handouts or tax breaks to help balance family budgets? Not according to Sunak, who has warned voters that it’s time to “move on” from government support.Sunak on... pensionsThe triple-lock pensions policy is a tricky one for Sunak – especially since Labour has committed to retaining the policy. Any change to a policy that has become a hallmark of recent Conservative governments would not go down well with the 12 million pensioners it would likely impact – many of whom are lifelong Tory voters.Last November, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said pensions should start being pegged to an average of inflation and wage growth, which would help reduce state spending over time.Sunak’s response to that was ambiguous to say the least: “We are the government that has … delivered the triple lock and it is why, right now, pensions are, depending on how you look at it, £800 or £900 bigger than they otherwise would have been.” He is yet to confirm whether it will appear in the manifesto."
Yahoo News UK,"3 electoral maps that show how disastrous the election could be for the ToriesWith new modelling predicting a Labour victory even bigger than Tony Blair's 1997 landslide, the outlook for Rishi Sunak is not looking good.",['Which Tory ministers are at risk of losing their seats?'],James Cheng-Morris and  James Hockaday,Updated 5 June 2024 at 8:34 pm·4-min read,5,June,2024,08:34:00,4,"The outlook was already looking bleak for the Conservative Party when Rishi Sunak called the general election following months of dismal approval ratings that showed little sign of improving.At a campaign event last week, Sunak said he didn't think defeat to Labour was a ""foregone conclusion"", suggesting his main election rival Sir Keir Starmer was taking the British electorate ""for granted"".However, a general election projection released on Monday will have added to the Tories' woes – predicting the biggest win for Labour in the party's history, surpassing even that of Tony Blair's 1997 landslide.The analysis, carried out by YouGov for Sky News, used a relatively new polling technique called Multi-level Regression and Post-stratification (MRP), which is regarded to have had a good track record and can provide detailed predictions at a constituency level basis. The scale of Sunak's problems is demonstrated by the interactive maps below, showing just how much ground the Tories are expected to lose compared to their 2019 victory.Click on the arrows in the top left to switch between the two maps. Check your own constituency to see if it is projected to change handsThe first map above shows the seats won in the 2019 general election, when Boris Johnson led the party to a stunning majority.The wall of Tory blue on the map, compared to the spots of Labour red, is a demonstration of just how far Labour, then led by Jeremy Corbyn, had fallen in public standing. The result was Labour's worst electoral performance since 1935.If you toggle to the second map, the projection by YouGov (which was based on polling carried out between 24 May - 1 June) suggests that Starmer's party is on track to win 422 seats, with the Tories down to just 140.Such a result would be the Conservative Party's worst performance at a general election since 1906. If YouGov's predictions are accurate, Labour winning a 194-seat majority would be the highest number since Conservative Stanley Baldwin won a majority of 208 in 1924.The model suggests the Conservatives could be set for near wipeout across many areas of the country, including London, the North East, the North West, and Wales.It also projects that the Scottish National Party would lose more than half their seats, with Labour returning as the largest party north of the border, and the Liberal Democrats reclaiming its place as the third party of British politics – winning 48 seats.The new figures, released yesterday, came as Reform UK co-founder Nigel Farage announced that he would be returning as the populist party's leader and would stand for election in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. Even before Farage's latest bid, pollsters told Yahoo News that Reform UK could pose a serious threat to the Tories by splitting the vote and potentially handing even more seats to Labour.The YouGov projection follows a similar poll by modelling site Electoral Calculus, which came out on 31 May. The polling also compares the 2019 result with Electoral Calculus' projection.It predicts that Labour is on course to win an even bigger majority of 319 seats - with Starmer's party picking up 485 MPs and the Tories way behind with 66. The modelling shows the Lib Dems getting very close to the Conservative Party, with 59 seats.While Electoral Calculus' polling, based on opinion polls from 8 May to 20 May, returns a different set of projections to YouGov's, both clearly indicate the scale of the problem facing Sunak.The Electoral Calculus model has predicted Sir Keir Starmer's Labour will win a massive majority.

Yahoo News UK,Who is Ed Davey? Lib Dem leader attracts attention with election stuntsEverything you need to know about the former minister who has pledged to fight for the NHS.,[],Hannah Fearn,7 June 2024 at 11:47 pm·7-min read,7,June,2024,11:47:00,7,"Ed Davey has been involved in a number of comedy stunts since the election was called. (Alamy) With the spotlight on prime minister Rishi Sunak and Labour leader Keir Starmer as they prepare to slug it out in a general election campaign, the focus had started slipping from Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey until a series of stunts put him back in the spotlight.The former coalition government cabinet minister - who lost his seat, punished by voters for getting into bed with the Tories, but then won it back again - is sending a clear message that he should not be overlooked.He’s had a long political career and the climax may still be ahead: if polls continue to shift away from the Conservatives at the current trajectory, there’s a slim possibility that, if the election is held in October, he could end up as Leader of the Opposition.So what do we know about the man behind the third party in British politics? Hannah Fearn finds out.His early lifeEd Davey was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on Christmas Day in 1965. He was the youngest of three boys, but lost his father at just four years old, and his mother followed over a decade later when he was in his mid-teens. She spent three years battling cancer, during which time he nursed his mother together with his grandmother and brother Henry.Once a keen Scout and Air Scout, he later remembers feeling “isolated” at school because of his caring responsibilities, which meant he couldn’t take part in after-school activities or sports. “The last 18 months she was bedridden and in a lot of pain. I’d spend hours on the bed, talking to her,” he said. Davey was with his mother when she died at Nottingham General Hospital, after being placed on an unsuited dementia ward.After both his parents had died, Davey was brought up by his maternal grandparents in the village of Eakring, though his grandfather died soon after. He spent much of his childhood and young adulthood close to his grandmother. “First of all, she was looking after me. Then we were looking after each other,” he said.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

The strict rule that governs what politicians can and can't sayHis familyDavey married Emily Gasson, a former Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate, in 2005. Gasson stood in four elections but failed to win a seat and is now a councillor. The pair have two children, a son and daughter.Their son, born in 2007 and now a teenager, is disabled with a neurological condition. He attended special schools but is now educated at home with a tutor - a change that Davey said led to him becoming verbal for the first time. He has spoken about his anxiety about who will care for his son when he and his wife are no longer around. “It’s the thing that worries me more than anything else in my life,” he said.Gasson was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in 2012. She was well for many years following her diagnosis, but declined during lockdown and is working on recovering her physical strength.Liberal Democrats election broadcast shows Ed Davey with his son. (Liberal Democrats)His parentsHis father, John, was a solicitor and his mother, Nina, a teacher. Davey has described how he was inspired to study by his mother, who always wanted him to try hard academically and who he wanted to impress.His educationDavey attended the private Nottingham High School, the alma mater of former chancellor Kenneth Clarke. He became head boy, with Labour MP Ed Balls - who was studying in the year below - watching on. After school, he achieved a first class degree in philosophy, politics and economics at Jesus College, Oxford where he was junior common room president. After becoming an economics research for the Liberal Democrats he returned to study, reading for a master’s degree in economics at Birkbeck College, London.Ed Davey, pictured with his family. (Liberal Democrats)Why is he a sir?For three years, the Lib Dem leader was a member of the cabinet during the period of Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, holding the post of secretary of state for energy and climate change from 2012 to 2015. He was knighted in the 2016 New Year’s Honours for “political and public services”.Davey on... the cost of living crisisDavey has repeatedly attacked the government for failing to curb rapid inflation and the devastating effect it is having on household budgets. He called the Conservative Party “so out of touch they might as well be living on another planet”, and said he warned Jeremy Hunt “people are desperate for real help… but all the chancellor could offer is empty words and unfair tax hikes”. In particular, he has urged more action on food price inflation, which analysis from his own party found had risen 37 per cent in one year for the average weekly supermarket trip. He has promised to end energy hikes and abandoned his plan to add 1p to income tax to save the NHS because ordinary voters can no longer afford it.Davey on... the NHSThe Liberal Democrats have made the NHS a cornerstone of their policy platform for the last five years. In Davey’s words: “Voting Conservative is bad for your health.” He promises to reverse cuts to GP numbers and guarantee a doctor’s appointment when you need one, improve access to NHS dentistry and save lives by tackling ambulance call out delays. Davey blames the care crisis for deepening the problems of the health service and says his party would spend £5bn a year on a “care package” to ensure patients are discharged from hospital more quickly, freeing up bed space. However, there is little detail on how this would be financed without raising taxes on the wealthiest - which Davey has promised not to do in his push to poach disillusioned Tory voters.British Leader of the Liberal Democrats party Ed Davey arrives at the BBC Broadcasting House, for his appearance on 'Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg', in London, Britain, April 28, 2024. REUTERS/Maja SmiejkowskaDavey on... immigrationThe Lib Dem leader has been a long-standing advocate for refugee rights and critic of the government’s immigration policy. He has called for Conservative plans to deport failed asylum seekers to Rwanda a “cynical distraction” from the partygate crisis and the money would be better spent on measures to tackle the cost of living crisis. He added: “They’ve provided no evidence to suggest that this new policy will stop illegal smuggling, they’re not cracking down on the organised crime gangs, which is what you need to do.” He has called for a new right to work for refugees and asylum seekers, and major reform of the Home Office which he says is no longer up to the job. After the end of the coalition government, Davey has said his party “was wrong” to go along with the introduction of a minimum income standard for immigrants. He later described the policy as “nasty and unfair”.Davey on... the Post Office scandalDespite the Horizon scandal that led to the wrongful prosecution of more than 700 subpostmasters crossing the tenure of more than a dozen business secretaries, Ed Davey has recently taken the heat for failing to investigate the issue while he was in the job.It has emerged that Davey initially rejected a request to meet justice campaigner Alan Bates, and later accepted it only on the advice that it would be good for his PR. He has recently apologised for not acting earlier, admitting that he is sorry that he “did not see through Post Office lies” about the fault in the Horizon programme."
