South Wales Argus,By-election won by just nine votes as new councillors are elected,[],Twm Owen,24 June 2024 at 10:00 am·1-min read,24,June,2024,10:00:00,1,"TWO new Labour councillors have been elected to Chepstow Town Council in two by-elections held on the same day.Voters were asked to elect new councillors in the town’s Maple Avenue and Castle wards in the polls held on Thursday, July 20.The closest contest was the Maple Avenue ward where Labour’s Olivia Amphlett gained 60 votes, which was nine more than Conservative candidate Keith Eric James Allen.In the Chepstow Castle ward Labour’s Debra Wilkes triumphed with 194 votes against Conservative Victoria Bedford who received 91 votes.There were three spoilt papers in the Castle ward and the turnout was 15 per cent which was lower than the 19 per cent in the Maple Avenue ward where there were no spoilt papers."
The Telegraph,Keir Starmer: I would pay if I saw parent shoplifting baby formula,[],Genevieve Holl-Allen,24 June 2024 at 0:56 pm·2-min read,24,June,2024,00:56:00,2,"Sir Keir Starmer has said he would offer to pay if he saw a parent shoplifting baby formula.The Labour leader told the Big Issue: “I’d offer to pay it. The desperation of families around the country should make the Tories feel nothing but shame.“Of course, shoplifting is a problem for businesses, so we’d have 13,000 more neighbourhood police to provide reassurance on our high streets.“But we’d also change the rules so people could use food bank vouchers and loyalty card points to buy baby formula,” he added.Necessary baby food items are now commonly kept locked or have security tags on them - JAMES LINSELL/SWNSSir Keir and John Swinney, the leader of the SNP, both said they would get out their wallets for a parent deemed “clearly in need” stealing baby formula.The Labour leader echoed comments made by Sadiq Khan, the London Mayor, earlier this year, who said he would offer to pay if he saw a parent shoplifting baby products.Meanwhile, Rishi Sunak said he would not, and told the magazine: “Shoplifting is not a victimless crime and we’ll always support shopkeepers to prevent theft.“At the same time, we will continue to help parents with the cost of living.”Sir Ed Davey said that he would “try to persuade [the parent] not to, obviously“, adding that to “try and find them other help, that would be the best way of doing it.”Mr Swinney, the Scottish First Minister, said: “I’d discreetly offer to pay as no parent should ever have to face this situation.“Sadly, this is not hypothetical – I meet with my constituents, and people across Scotland, every week who face this kind of hardship.”In April, Mr Khan told the Big Issue: “What upsets me is the tags you have now, on nappies and baby foods, because of the issue that is in relation to somebody who is shoplifting.“In the hypothetical case, I suspect I’ll take my wallet out, and I would pay for it.”"
The Independent,Kemi Badenoch hints at another Tory leadership run after general election,[],Salma Ouaguira,24 June 2024 at 10:01 am·2-min read,24,June,2024,10:01:00,2,"Kemi Badenoch has hinted she could make another run for the Tory leadership, if the party loses the election next month.During a debate hosted by the Institute of Directors and Bloomberg on Monday, the Business Secretary was asked about her intentions if Rishi Sunak is ousted on 4 July.She claimed there was “no better job” than Business and Trade Secretary, which she described as being “a lot easier and a lot less pressured than being prime minister”.But the senior Conservative suggested she could have bigger ambitions to become a Tory leader wannabe despite losing the 2022 contest.The Conservative right-winger, who is fighting for re-election in the redrawn North West Essex seat, said: “The fact of the matter is, I stood and I lost. And what terrifies me now is not not becoming leader, it is seeing Labour come in.“This is one of the things that I’ve found most difficult doing this job, that people tend not to know what it is, because I’m always asked the leadership question. We’re so interested in the personalities, in the gossip and so on.“We need to focus on this election. The choice is going to be between us or between them. Be afraid if it is them, is all I would say. And we will talk about leadership things after an election, but not before.”The former women and equalities minister is favoured by the right of the party (PA Wire)The former Equalities Minister, known for her “anti-woke” approach, was tipped to become the new “Margaret Thatcher” before she became fourth in the final ballot behind Penny Mordaunt, Mr Sunak and Liz Truss.Ms Badenoch joins a long list of leadership contenders hoping to become the face of the opposition if Sir Keir Starmer gets into Downing Street.With Labour widening the gap in the polls and a potentially devastating Tory result in the general election, the party is preparing for the almost inevitable leadership battle that will follow.Contenders likely to run for the job include security minister Tom Tugendhat, whose Tinbridge seat is predicted to survive a potential seat wipeout.Former Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick and Home Secretary James Cleverly have also left the door open with Dame Priti Patel being tipped to make a comeback."
Yahoo News UK,Who will win the next general election? Latest polls and oddsThree new polls have each projected a seismic victory for Labour - with one even suggesting Rishi Sunak could lose his seat.,"[""Tories to slump to lowest number of seats since party's formation"", 'Conservatives on course for worst defeat in over a century', 'Sunak to lose seat in Tory wipeout, major poll predicts', 'What are the latest odds?', 'What went wrong for the Tories?']",James Cheng-Morris and  James Hockaday,Updated 19 June 2024 at 10:08 am·8-min read,19,June,2024,10:08:00,8,"Three polls released in the space of an hour have indicated that Rishi Sunak is on course for a crushing defeat in the upcoming general election - with one report suggesting he could become the first sitting prime minister to lose his seat.The polls published on Wednesday evening were commissioned by the Telegraph, Sky and the News Agents podcast. All the polls use the multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP) technique, which enables projections to be made at constituency level.And while all three polls indicate Sunak faces an uphill battle to avoid a major defeat, there is a significant disparity from all three as to how far ahead Keir Starmer actually is.Yahoo summaries the key points of the three pollsTories to slump to lowest number of seats since party's formationYouGov's polling for Sky News projects Labour is on course to achieve a 200-seat majority. Labour is predicted to secure 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.This projection would show the Tories plummeting from the 365 won by Boris Johnson in the 2019 election and give the party their lowest ever number of MPs. It would also give Starmer more seats than the 418 won by Tony Blair in 1997. Read a full report of this poll from Sky NewsThe YouGov poll for Sky News.Conservatives on course for worst defeat in over a centuryAccording to polling by More In Common UK for the News Agents podcast, Labour is projected to finish on 406 seats, a majority of 162.

This polling puts Labour on a massive 516 seats, with the Tories on only 53 - just in front of the Lib Dems on 50 - a forecast that would be remarkable were it to be reflected on polling night. According to the Telegraph, this is the first poll to project more than 500 seats for Labour and would be a truly astonishing result were it to happen.

Given the nature of these seat totals, it is natural to be slightly sceptical.""It adds: ""Not every MRP is the same. The statistical 'building blocks' used to model voter behaviour will vary from pollster to pollster, which will in turn lead to different vote shares and seat totals. All different pollsters will get different national vote share.""The MRP methodology, as described by YouGov, ""uses data at the constituency level to predict the outcomes of seats based on the concentration of various different types of voters who live there"".Stuart Wilks-Heeg, writing in The Conversation earlier this month, points out some of the other limitations of MRP polling: ""There are ... factors MRPs cannot take into account. Some constituency results will be influenced by locally specific issues that statistical models can’t capture. For example, adjustments cannot be made for who the candidates are in each constituency and whether any have a profile that could enhance, or detract from, their party’s chance of winning. Think Nigel Farage standing for Reform UK in Clacton.""And competing MRPs produce contrasting outcomes because each model uses specific assumptions and data. Different inputs produce different outputs. This election has seen more MRPs produced than ever before, and from various organisations. In the early hours of July 5, we’ll know which one came closest to getting the result correct.""What are the latest odds?As of 19 June, Oddschecker – a website which compares odds across different bookmakers – had Labour at 1/41 to win the most seats. To put that in context, this is seen as so likely that a £10 bet would return just £10.24.The Conservatives are 40/1 to win the most seats, a scenario seen as so unlikely that a £10 punt would return £410.What went wrong for the Tories?YouGov's voting intention tracker between January 2020 and June 2024. (YouGov)So, why have the polls changed so dramatically? It's worth looking back on an extremely eventful four-and-a-half years in UK politics.According to YouGov's voting intention tracker (see chart, above), Tory support peaked at 53%, with Labour on 32%, in April 2020, months after the party's stunning success in the 2019 general election and Boris Johnson's pledge to “get Brexit done”. That month also saw Starmer take over as Labour leader from Jeremy Corbyn.This was also amid a spirit of national unity following the onset of the COVID pandemic which nearly killed Johnson himself. The then-PM had been released from hospital five days before this particular survey was taken.Boris Johnson delivers his final speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street in September 2022. (AFP via Getty Images)Over the rest of the year, there was a downturn in support amid chaos over COVID rules, with the Tories falling as low as 35% in November 2020, compared to Labour on 40%.However, the UK’s successful COVID vaccination programme provided a pathway out of lockdown and with it, improved poll ratings. Tory support peaked at 41% in June 2021, with Labour at 30%.In October that year, there was a sense Johnson was untouchable. At the Tory party conference, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg remarked how the PM was ""in total command of his party, and politically dominant in the country"".But this fell apart quickly with the Partygate scandal, which emerged in November that year. Time and again, reports emerged of government and Tory staff – including Johnson – having taken part in lockdown-era social gatherings when their own COVID rules had prohibited them.By January 2022, Tory support had plummeted to 28%, with Labour on 38%. Johnson struggled on, but never recovered and a wave of ministerial resignations forced him to resign in July that year.The UK had three separate prime ministers – Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak – between 6 September and 24 October, 2022. (Getty Images)His successor, Liz Truss, then embarked on arguably the most disastrous prime ministerial reign in history, characterised by the catastrophic ""mini-budget"", containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, which prompted an economic crisis. Like Johnson, she lost the confidence of Tory MPs – and voters – and had to resign.Her 49-day spell as PM was the shortest in history, with Tory support plummeting to 19% (with Labour on 56%) the day after she announced her resignation in October 2022.Rishi Sunak, who had lost to Truss in the previous month's Tory leadership election, took over. However, as the above YouGov chart indicates, he has failed to cut through with voters. Tory support was at 23% two days after he assumed office, with the most recent survey, carried out on Thursday, showing support is now lower than under Truss at 18%.In short, the polls and odds, not to mention other factors such as notable by-election victories for Starmer's Labour, are pointing to a Labour government next month.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

The Guardian,Senior Tories call for ban on political bets by MPs after election scandal,[],"Rob Davies, Jessica Elgot and Matthew Weaver",24 June 2024 at 0:39 pm·5-min read,24,June,2024,00:39:00,5,"Senior Conservatives and campaigners are calling for a ban on political bets by MPs, as the Gambling Commission was urged to look into another £500 wager connected with the growing election gambling scandal.The former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said parties should examine the rules when parliament returns amid growing outrage over Tory candidates and aides allegedly staking money on politics. The former defence minister Tobias Ellwood also said there should be new restrictions.The Conservatives have launched their own inquiry into whether politicians or officials gambled on the timing of the election. Rishi Sunak was forced to deny having placed any bets himself and told reporters he was not aware of any further candidates under scrutiny.“We’ve been conducting our own internal inquiries and of course will act on any relevant findings or information from that and pass it on to the Gambling Commission,” he said.The Gambling Commission has been urged to investigate a flurry of unusual activity around the time Sunak called the election, an industry source told the Guardian.It includes a bet of £504, placed on the Sunday before the election was called, that Sunak would still be PM before the 2024 election. The implication is that the punter may have known that the election call was imminent, thus giving the Tory party no time to replace Sunak.Marginal odds meant the punter stood to gain only £35 from the bet. Details of the bet have been provided to the commission by a professional gambler.Earlier this month the Guardian revealed that the gambling watchdog had written to all licensed bookmakers requesting information on anyone who stood to gain more than £199 by betting on the timing of the election. The scope of the investigation is understood to include bets placed against an autumn election as well as those placed on a summer one.Another gambling industry source said more junior figures may emerge as the commission conducts background checks on the hundreds of people who placed bets on the timing of the poll in the days before Sunak announced the date.Four Tory candidates and officials are under investigation by the Gambling Commission: Sunak’s top parliamentary aide, Craig Williams, the candidate for Montgomeryshire and Glyndŵr; the Tory candidate in Bristol West, Laura Saunders; her husband and the party’s director of campaigning, Tony Lee; and the party’s chief data officer, Nick Mason, who has denied wrongdoing.An unnamed Metropolitan police officer who is part of Sunak’s close protection security team has been arrested in connection with the inquiry.Duncan Smith said the public took a “dim view” of politicians who gambled on politics. “I am opposed to people associated with politics betting on political outcomes in general because they’re too close to it,” he said. “It also looks casual if you’re betting on stuff that affects people’s quality of life.“You can either do it by the party saying it won’t be tolerated, or you could do it by legislation. If you start relying on legislation, it would be a complex process. Parties are capable of saying that anyone who does this shouldn’t be in the party. They can move quicker than governments.“But one way or the other, it needs to be made clear that the public takes a dim view of it and it shouldn’t happen. It’s a matter for the next parliament.”Ellwood told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme it was comparable to the rules placed on the stock market. “Let’s introduce clear rules, as you have in the City in connection to the purchase of stocks and shares, for example. Let’s prevent any current politician or party professional from placing any bets in the future,” he said.It is understood that Labour is not planning any action on restricting political betting by its candidates or staff, as long as the bets are not placed with any insider information.Speaking at a school in Kettering, Keir Starmer said: “I’m not sure we need to start changing the rules. The rules actually aren’t the problem here; there’s a problem with the politicians. The moment the election was called, they didn’t say, ‘Give me a microphone and let me make my case,’; they said, ‘Let me head down to bookies.’”Other senior politicians and campaigners have joined calls for bets to be restricted. Don Foster, the Liberal Democrat peer and chair of Peers for Gambling Reform, said all betting on elections should be banned.“The current rules are incredibly opaque and this farrago is a good illustration,” he said. “My personal view is that after the election, we should clarify the rules, including saying that gambling companies should not be allowed to take bets on the outcome of, or anything relating to, elections at any level within the UK.”Will Prochaska, of the Coalition Against Gambling Ads, said: “Political betting should be banned, along with betting on anything other than sports or horse racing. It’s totally inappropriate for the gambling industry to offer a market for political betting, not least because it tempts those with inside information to try and make a few quid, but also because it normalises the idea that we should bet on anything and everything, which is not normal.“In the absence of a complete ban, clearly, politicians and their staff should not be able to gamble on political events. We need to protect politics from people who view it as chance to make a quick buck.”"
PA Media: UK News,Sunak warns Labour government would be ‘disaster’ as he battles to save campaign,[],"David Hughes, PA Political Editor",24 June 2024 at 3:36 am·5-min read,24,June,2024,03:36:00,5,"Rishi Sunak will warn that it would take decades to recover from the “disaster” of a Labour government as he seeks to rally Tories to fight for every vote in the closing stages of the General Election campaign.The Prime Minister will tell activists they have just 10 days to “take our message to every corner of the United Kingdom” before polls open on July 4.With the Conservatives still around 20 points behind in the polls and after a bruising few days dominated by allegations about alleged insider betting, Mr Sunak will urge Tories not to “surrender” to Sir Keir Starmer’s party.The Prime Minister will launch the Scottish Tory manifesto and address a campaign event in London at the start of the last full week of campaigning.His latest intervention comes with him under pressure from within the Conservative Party to take a tougher stance against those being investigated by the Gambling Commission for betting on the election date.According to extracts of his speech briefed to the Daily Mail, Mr Sunak will say: “We have 10 days to take our message to every corner of the United Kingdom.“To make the argument that this country needs lower taxes, not £2,000 more taxes for every working family.“To make the case that a Labour government would be bad for our country, and an unchecked Labour government would be a disaster from which it would take decades to recover.”(PA Graphics)Labour has repeatedly denied Tory claims that it is planning to increase taxes on working families.But Mr Sunak will say: “When a politician won’t tell you what they are going to do, it means that they know you won’t like it.“All their evasions tell you is that they are going to whack up council tax and a bunch of other taxes.“And one thing we know about Keir Starmer is that he has no problem going back on his promises. His career is a story of commitments dropped as soon as they became too difficult to keep.“I tell you this: once you have handed Keir Starmer and Labour a blank cheque, you won’t be able to get it back.”In an attempt to boost Tory morale, Mr Sunak will say: “Don’t surrender to Labour. Fight for every vote, fight for our values, fight for our vision of Britain.”The Conservative campaign has been plunged into a deeper crisis by the gambling controversy, with the party’s chief data officer Nick Mason understood to be taking a leave of absence amid claims he placed bets on the election date.Director of campaigning Tony Lee has also taken a leave of absence, while Mr Lee’s would-be MP wife Laura Saunders and fellow candidate Craig Williams, who was a parliamentary aide to the Prime Minister, are also under investigation by the Gambling Commission.Home Secretary James Cleverly said he was not aware of any ministers caught up in the betting row (Lucy North/PA)Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris faced questions about how wide the inquiry might go as he was sent out on the airwaves for a faltering broadcast round on Monday morning.The minister said it would be wrong to “suggest somebody is guilty until proven innocent” when asked why the Prime Minister would not take what former defence minister Tobias Ellwood called “robust action”.Asked whether Mr Sunak should ask Mr Williams when he placed his bet, the Northern Ireland Secretary told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It wouldn’t surprise me in the slightest if that conversation has been had, but you asked me if I knew, and I don’t.”He suggested the Conservative Party does not know whether the Tory candidate had insider knowledge when he placed his bet or whether it was “just a hunch”.“There’s both a principle point and a practical point there,” Mr Heaton-Harris told LBC when asked why Mr Williams had not had party backing withdrawn pending the inquiry.“It needs to be determined whether or not he had prior knowledge.”Asked how damaging the scandal was, he said: “It’s not great because we should be talking about how we’re going to lower taxes and how we’re going to lower immigration.”Mr Ellwood on Monday joined a growing chorus of senior Tory voices calling for the Prime Minister to take action over the allegations.The Conservative candidate for Bournemouth East said the inquiries were a “deeply unhelpful, self-inflicted distraction” and suggested Mr Sunak should have suspended those being investigated.Ministers have been pressed on whether members of Cabinet could be involved after the Prime Minister repeatedly refused to say whether he could confirm his top team would not face allegations.Asked if ministers had bet on the date, Home Secretary James Cleverly told the BBC: “Not to my knowledge.”Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove compared the impact of the row with the Partygate scandal.“It looks like one rule for them and one rule for us,” he told the Sunday Times, adding: “That’s the most potentially damaging thing.”Mr Gove went on to suggest it was “just not acceptable” for those in a “privileged position” close to the Prime Minister to use what he described as “inside information to make additional money for yourself”.Mr Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer will face questions from Sun readers on Monday afternoon in the latest set piece of the election campaign.Labour is set to focus on health issues, raising concerns about “DIY dentistry” because of a lack of NHS treatment.Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: “It’s virtually impossible to get a dentist appointment after 14 years of Conservative neglect.“People are resorting to pulling their own teeth out – DIY dentistry should be the stuff of Charles Dickens’ books, not Britain in 2024.”"

I love it. There’s no better job.“It is a lot easier and a lot less pressured than being prime minister.“The fact of the matter is, I stood and I lost. And what terrifies me now is not not becoming leader, it is seeing Labour come in.”She continued: “This is one of the things that I’ve found most difficult doing this job, that people tend not to know what it is, because I’m always asked the leadership question. We’re so interested in the personalities, in the gossip and so on...“We need to focus on this election. The choice is going to be between us or between them. Be afraid if it is them, is all I would say. And we will talk about leadership things after an election, but not before.”Political leaders wish Princess Royal a speedy recovery13:39 , Joe MiddletonPolitical leaders have wished Princess Anne a speedy recovery after she suffered minor injuries to her head and a concussion when it is believed she was kicked by a horse on her Gatcombe Park estate.The Princess Royal, 73, an Olympic-medal-winning horsewoman, was walking on her Gloucestershire estate on Sunday evening when the incident happened.Emergency services were despatched to the estate and, after medical care at the scene, the princess was transferred to Southmead Hospital in Bristol for appropriate tests, treatment and observation.Prime minister Rishi Sunak said: “Everyone in the country is immensely fond of Her Royal Highness. We’re all sending her our best wishes for a swift recovery.”Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: “Wishing Her Royal Highness a speedy recovery and sending my best wishes on behalf of all of us at the Labour Party.”Labour dodges question about European Court of Justice role in new EU deal13:26 , Andre LangloisShadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds has dodged a question about whether a future Labour government would accept a role for the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in a future deal with the European Union.Taking questions during Bloomberg’s Business Debate, Mr Reynolds said: “We’re not going to give away our negotiating hand entirely but... the argument on food and agricultural products is this: do you want lower standards than the European Union?“If you don’t want lower standards, surely we remove pragmatically some of those checks and balances to make sure we can have as close a relationship as is possible, to remove some of those costs. There will still be costs because we’re not going to talk about going back into a customs union.”Tory business secretary Kemi Badenoch described his response as “astonishing” and added: “What would they have to give up in order to get that? That is the question that they don’t want to answer, saying it’s part of their negotiating hand.”She accused Labour of trying to take the country “back into the EU without saying so” and said: “We cannot allow any kind of oversight from the ECJ – that’s not something that you should be keeping in your back pocket. That’s something that you need to be honest about with the British public.”Mr Reynolds hit back: “This is a conversation on one side, on the Conservative side, which is all about to be frank the next leadership election in the Conservative Party and the red lines within there.”Watch: Tory minister reveals how he would bet on election 'if he was allowed'13:17 , Joe MiddletonKemi Badenoch and Jonathan Reynolds clash over climate and net zero commitments13:12 , Jabed AhmedBusiness secretary Kemi Badenoch and her Labour counterpart Jonathan Reynolds have clashed over whether net zero is an opportunity to be seized or cost to be mitigated.Speaking at Bloomberg’s UK Election 2024: The Business Debate, Mr Reynolds said: “It’s an opportunity. I mean, it couldn’t be any clearer than that – it’s one of the greatest opportunities that has ever existed and actually for the UK, when you think about some of that regional inequality that we are very familiar with, that the transition could be something that isn’t just an opportunity in itself, (but it) actually addresses some of the real long, deep-seated problems within the British economy.“And the job of Government around that is not to deliver that itself, of course it’s not, it’s to build and shape the markets that the private sector will then operate around.”Ms Badenoch responded: “It is both. When we decided that net zero was going to be a policy, this was a cross-party thing. It wasn’t just Conservatives. There is no major party that has said it does not want the net zero target by 2050, but that was in 2018. Look at what happened since then – Covid and a war in Ukraine that’s completely changed the landscape for what that meant.”The Business Secretary added: “Yes, it can be an opportunity, but we need to make sure that we deliver other things on a no-regrets basis.”Mr Reynolds responded and added Labour had altered its £28 billion climate pledge.Rachel Reeves weighs in on Tory election betting scandal13:03 , Jabed AhmedRishi Sunak has shown an “astonishing lack of leadership” by failing to suspend Conservatives facing investigation into betting on the date of the General Election, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has insisted.Ms Reeves said Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer had “been really clear” that “if this had been Labour candidates, their feet would not have touched the ground”.Speaking during a visit to a windfarm in East Renfrewshire, the shadow chancellor said: “When wrong doing takes place in Labour, candidates are suspended. That is not an easy thing to do but it is the right thing to do.”She stated: “It is an astonishing lack of leadership from Rishi Sunak that these candidates are still in place, they have still got the Conservative rosette.“Rishi Sunak is now so weak he is not even able to suspend people who are accused of profiteering from inside information. It is frankly one rule for Conservative candidates and staffers and another rule for everybody else.”She added: “In the end voters will judge the Conservatives on their 14 years and sleaze, the abuse of public office, is quite high in people’s minds. It is one of the reasons why people want change after 14 years of chaos and decline” (Reuters)Reform leader claims Labour in power would be ‘even more incompetent than Tories’12:58 , Salma OuaguiraNigel Farage has claimed that if Labour gets into Downing Street, it would be “even more incompetent than the Conservatives”.The Reform leader said: “I believe this Labour government will get into trouble very, very quickly. They will prove to be, if it is possible, even more incompetent than the Conservatives have been.“And as he tries to take us back to EU rules, as we get more lunacy on trans laws and everything else, you will find a government and a Parliament split from its people.“So my ambition is for us to establish a bridgehead in Parliament on July 4 and over the course of the next five years to build up a mass movement for common sense, for decency, to represent the silent majority in this country.”Farage doubles down on small boats ‘invasion’ attack12:53 , Salma OuaguiraNigel Farage has claimed he was right to describe migrants crossing the Channel in small boats an “invasion”.He doubled down on Reform’s pledge to ditch the European Court on Human Rights as he criticised Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda scheme.He said the UK was “not meanspirited or nasty” but people coming to the UK illegally would never be granted refugee status unless they pay taxes and obey the law. (Jordan Pettitt/PA Wire)Tees Valley Tory mayor claims Labour activists are encouraging Tories to vote Reform12:48 , Jabed AhmedThe Conservative’s Tees Valley mayor Lord Ben Houchen has claimed Labour activists are encouraging Tories to vote for Reform UK.In a video shared on X, a Labour campaigner could be seen telling a Reform voter “all you’re doing is taking votes away from the Conservatives, so we want you to vote Reform”.Lord Houchen told The Independent: “This just shows that there’s everything still to play for at the election and Labour are panicking. They can’t convince anyone to back Slippery Starmer and they know there is no love for the Labour Party on the doors, so they’ve resorted to campaigning for Reform in the hope they can stop Conservatives being elected.“Many people across our country are very worried about a Labour Government, and now the cat is out of the bag. A vote for Reform is a vote for Labour and Slippery Starmer.”Farage blasts Tories ‘greedy and stupid’ over betting scandal12:46 , Salma OuaguiraNigel Farage has attacked the Conservatives over the betting scandal engulfing the party.The Reform leader told supporters in Maidstone: “The sheer level of greed and stupidity that leads people right at the heart of government, who know when the election is going to be called, to put on bets is astonishing but perhaps sums up the self-entitled view that this Conservative Party has after 14 years in government.”Mr Farage claimed the current accusations against Tories are just the “tip of the iceberg” and predicted “this scandal will get worse”.Farage: ‘I take no lectures from Labour’12:38 , Salma OuaguiraNigel Farage has responded to attacks made by the main parties on his controversial comments on Ukraine.Speaking from the top of a double-decker bus, he has doubled down on statements about the war and western involvement.He said: “I won’t be lectured by the Conservative party or Sir Keir Starmer. This is the same Starmer who backed Corbyn to leave NATO. So, no thank you.”The Reform leader took aim at Starmer’s pledge to scrap a law protecting Nortern Ireland veterans from prosecution, the Legacy Act. And blasted: “Along with David Lammy, he wants us to join the European Defence Union.” (REUTERS)Sunak responds after IFS slams Tory and Labour manifestos12:38 , Jabed AhmedRishi Sunak has responded to the Institute for Fiscal Studies’ (IFS) analysis of the major parties’ manifestos.Earlier today IFS director Paul Johnson said both the Conservative and Labour manifestos “essentially ignore” some of the “big challenges” in the economy.Facing questions about the analysis, the prime minister said: “No, I don’t agree with that. We have a fully costed manifesto which can deliver tax cuts for people at every stage in their lives and that is largely funded by making sure that we can find some savings in the growth of the welfare budget, because it’s been growing at unsustainable levels since the pandemic.“We’ve set out a very clear plan to reform that, to support people into work, and in fact, the IFS acknowledge that last time around they said that that wasn’t possible, that it was actually delivered, and that’s something that the IFS themselves have said.“Labour in contrast don’t think you can save a single penny from the welfare bill, which is already where we’re spending more than on transport, schools, law enforcement. I don’t think that’s right. I want to deliver tax cuts for people and constraining the increase in the welfare budget is the right way to do that to support people in work.”Farage brands Boris ‘liar’ over Putin12:26 , Salma OuaguiraNigel Farage has branded Boris Johnson a “liar” in a fierce attack for the prime ministe’s criticism over his comments on Ukraine.He unveiled a giant version of an i newspaper frontpage from 2016 with the the headline “Boris blames EU for war in Ukraine”.The Reform leader also said he will not apologise for claiming that the invasion by Russia was “provoked” by the West.He said: “I can’t take those words away. The fact that I was more far-sighted than more politicians is not something I’ll apologise for.”Despite the comments, he condemned Putin’s actions, adding: “None of this justifies what he’s done. And who knows - he may have done it anyway. But we gave him to give his people a reason for doing so.“And you think I’m on my own in thinking this? The Pope in 2022 - it’s not often the Pope and I are on the same side of any debate particularly - I’m a bit more Henry VIII. But the Pope made this point in 2022.” (REUTERS)Nigel Farage is speaking from Maidstone12:22 , Salma OuaguiraThe Reform leader claims his party represents “the new kids on the block” and is the topic of conversation during this election capaign.Speaking in Maidstone, he jokes about his grandchild’s birthday: “I want to make a little announcement. Yesterday was 23 June the anniversary of Brexit. It was also yesterday that my first grandchild was born. I don’t think I’ll ever forget when his brithday is.”He adds: “We are doing rather well. There is more conversation about Reform than anything going on in this campaign that’s partly because Sunak and Starmer are simply so monotone, dull, and don’t say anything believable.”Nigel Farage speaking at the Mercure Maidstone Great Danes Hotel in Maidstone Kent (Jordan Pettitt/PA Wire)Conservatives running parallel inquiry to the Gambling Commission, Sunak says12:10 , Jabed AhmedPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has said his party “will act” if the Conservatives’ own parallel inquiry into the alleged betting scandal finds wrongdoing.He said: “The Gambling Commission is independent of Government – it’s independent of me.“I don’t have the details of their investigation, right? They don’t report to me, I don’t have the details, but what I can tell you is, in parallel we’ve been conducting our own internal inquiries and of course will act on any relevant findings or information from that and pass it on to the Gambling Commission.”When asked whether he had ever bet on politics whilst being an MP, the Prime Minister replied: “No.” (POOL/AFP via Getty Images)Sunak rules out he is facing probe from the Gambling Commission amid Tory betting scandal12:06 , Jabed AhmedRishi Sunak has said he was “not aware” of the Gambling Commission investigating any further Tory candidates over allegations of betting on the General Election.“The Gambling Commission don’t talk about the individuals that they are investigating,” the Prime Minister told journalists in a huddle in Edinburgh.“What I can tell you is I am not aware of any other candidate that they are looking at.”He also ruled himself out.Opinion poll round-up with 10 days to go12:00 , Jabed AhmedTwo opinion polls have been published in the past 24 hours, both of which show Labour well ahead of the Conservatives and Reform in third place.A poll by Savanta, carried out online from June 19-21 among 2,103 UK adults, gives Labour a 23-percentage point lead.The latest poll by Opinium, carried out online from June 19-21 among 2,052 UK adults, puts Labour 20 points ahead.An average of all polls with survey work completed during the seven days to June 24 puts Labour on 40%, 20 points ahead of the Conservatives on 20%, followed by Reform on 18%, the Lib Dems on 11% and the Greens on 6%.Coming up: Nigel Farage to give a speech from Kent11:57 , Salma OuaguiraNigel Farage is expected to deliver the “most important speech of the campaign so far”.Reform supporters are waiting at the Mercure Maidstone Great Danes Gotel in Maidstone, Kent for his arrival.People wait for a speech by Reform UK leader Nigel Farage at the Mercure Maidstone Great Danes Hotel in Maidstone Kent (Jordan Pettitt/PA Wire)More than half of all Londoners planning to vote Labour, according to new poll11:56 , Jabed AhmedLabour has a 33-point lead in London amid a “anti-Conservative” mood in the capital, according to a new poll.The Savanta survey for the Mile End Institute at Queen Mary University of London found 55 per cent of Londoners are planning to vote Labour with only 22 per cent Tory.The poll further found a ten per cent voting intention for the Liberal Democrats, eight per cent for Reform UK, and five per cent for the Greens.Dr Elizabeth Simon, Postdoctoral Researcher in British Politics at Queen Mary University of London, said: “The fact that over a quarter of Londoners who voted for the Liberal Democrats at the 2019 General Election are now saying they will vote Labour is likely reflective of ‘anti-Conservative’ sentiment in the capital.“There appears to be a willingness to vote tactically to minimise the chance that Conservative candidates are elected, among Londoners.”Sunak and Starmer hit back at Farage over Ukraine comments11:39 , Jabed AhmedBoth Sir Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak have hit back over Nigel Farage’s comments about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Sir Keir said he “fundamentally” disagrees with the Reform UK leader’s comments that it would be better to negotiate with Vladimir Putin.“I fundamentally disagree. Russia is the aggressor here,” he said.The Labour leader added that he had been “proud of the fact that we’ve had unity throughout our parliament” in support for Kyiv.Speaking in Scotland, the prime minister echoed these comments.“You all heard what Nigel Farage said about Ukraine,” Mr Sunak said.“That plays into Putin’s hands. That kind of appeasement is dangerous for Britain’s security, the security of our allies that rely on us and will only embolden Putin.”Labour will look at potential changes to sex education in schools, Starmer says11:32 , Jabed AhmedSir Keir Starmer has said he is opposed to “gender ideology” being taught in schools.Asked if he would rip up the ban on teaching children and young people about “gender ideology” at school, he said: “No, I’m not in favour of ideology being taught in our schools on gender.”Asked about potential changes to sex education in schools, he said: “I think we need to complete the consultation process and make sure that there is guidance that is age appropriate. That is helpful for teachers and has at its heart the safeguarding of children.” (Jacob King/PA Wire)Labour would rather ‘virtue signal to eco-zealots’ than protect jobs, Sunak claims11:30 , Jabed AhmedPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has promised to “stand full square behind Scotland’s North Sea oil and gas industry”, as he accused Labour of “virtue signalling to eco-zealots”.Speaking in Edinburgh, Mr Sunak said: “Our North Sea industry isn’t safe with Labour.”He added: “The Conservative Government that I lead will always stand full square behind Scotland’s North Sea oil and gas industry.“We’re committed to new licences, more investment in infrastructure and skills and energy security for our country. We’ll deliver a secure future for the North Sea industry and for the workers that it employs, whereas Labour want to stop all new licences in the North Sea from day one of a Labour government.“Keir Starmer and Ed Miliband want to tax the UK’s oil and gas sector and the 100,000 Scottish jobs that it supports into oblivion.”To laughter, Mr Sunak said: “But Labour don’t want to ban all oil and gas it turns out – just British oil and gas. I mean, they would rather virtue signal to eco-zealots than protect jobs here at home.”Sunak accuses Farage of ‘dangerous appeasement’ towards Putin11:30 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak has accused the Reform leader of having a “dangerous appeasement” towards Putin.He told supporters the party is “not on the side of who you think they are” referring to Nigel Farage’s claims about the war in Ukraine.During the manifesto launch in Scotland, the prime minister added: “Reform are standing candidates here in Scotland that are pro independence and anti monarchy.“And you all heard what Nigel Farage said about Ukraine.

As a party in government we passed really important legislation that has made a material difference when it comes to equality.“Those challenges, that progress is not over. We need to make further progress, which is why I’m really proud of what we’ve got in the manifesto that we’re putting before the country this time. And that has to be done with a sort of real determination, with a conversation and discussion which is done respecting all different views. I think we can do that and further make the progress that we need.”Scottish Tories’ manifesto framed around ‘beating the SNP'11:19 , Salma OuaguiraAt the launch of the Scottish Conservative manifesto with Douglas Ross and Rishi Sunak - ‘beating the SNP’ gets top billing pic.twitter.com/mvW4lqr8PM— Libby Brooks (@libby_brooks) June 24, 2024Sunak: ‘Only Tories can stand against SNP'11:17 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak is now on the stage presenting the Scottish Tories’ manifesto.The prime minister has attacked Scottish rivals telling supporters that the Tories are the only party to “properly stand up to the SNP” at Holyrood.He said: “A vote for the Scottish Conservatives is a vote to put this issue to bed. To move past these tired and stale arguments and to go forward united and together.”The PM added: “But that can only happen if the SNP are routed. If they do not just lose some seats but the SNP lose big. And voting Scottish Conservative is the only way to ensure that that happens.” (Getty Images)‘immediate priority’ to scrap intermediate rate of income tax in Scotland, Douglas Ross says11:17 , Jabed AhmedThe Scottish Conservatives manifesto pledges to scrap the intermediate rate of income tax in Scotland.The tax rate – which sees Scots pay 21p in the pound on earning between £26,562 and £43,662 – should be reduced by 1p, the party has said, returning it to the same rate as other parts of the UK.Speaking at the launch of the manifesto, Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross said the tax cut would be an “immediate priority” and claimed it would save the majority of taxpayers in Scotland £171 per year.Keir Starmer asked about comparisons between Tory betting scandal and Rayner council house probe11:14 , Jabed AhmedSir Keir Starmer has faced questions about why he called for Conservative candidates caught up in the alleged betting scandal to be suspended, after his deputy Angela Rayner was not suspended amid a row over her past council house, which police probed.The Labour leader said: “I think there’s a material difference and that is that the Tories caught up in this gambling escapade are openly admitting that they did it.“There’s no issue here about that. It is the middle of an election campaign and Rishi Sunak needs to show some leadership. If these were my candidates, I’ll tell you what, they’d be gone. Their feet wouldn’t have touched the floor.”Sir Keir added: “There’s a bigger argument here about politics, because the first instinct of these Tories about a General Election is not ‘what can we do for our country’ but ‘let’s see if we can make some money’ – and that is part of the change that is absolutely vital (in) the election a week on Thursday.”Greater Manchester Police dropped the probe in May and concluded Ms Rayner would face no further police action.Ross: SNP cannot ignore independence result11:11 , Salma OuaguiraDouglas Ross begins his speech describing the Tory Scottish manifesto as a “laser-focused on voter’s priorities”.Speaking from Edinburgh, he pledges to grow the economy, rebuild Scotish public services ans tackle issues “that really matter to communities”.He adds: “If the SNP do not just lose this election in Scotland but have a terrible result and are defeated right across the country – then we will have put the nationalists’ political obsession to rest for a generation.“Scotland will have again firmly said no to independence. No to more division. No to five more years of separatist campaigning and distraction. That will be a verdict that John Swinney and his SNP Government cannot ignore.” (Getty Images)The five key areas Scottish Tory manifesto is focused on11:10 , Jabed AhmedThe Scottish Tory manifesto is focused on five key areas, the document says.They are:“Repairing the roads”“Ending long NHS waits”“Restoring our schools”“Making Scotland safer”“Cutting your tax”The majority of these areas largely relate to devolved competencies of the Scottish Government in Holyrood, not the UK Government in Westminster.

The economy has flatlined for 14 years. That is exactly what we are wanting to change, that’s why we’ve set out our plans for growth in our manifesto.“So, the choice is more stagnation as we’ve seen for the last 14 years, which hasn’t done our country any good, or turn the page, rebuild, regrow our economy and create wealth so that, across Britain, people feel better off.”11:02 , Salma OuaguiraComing up: Rishi Sunak set to launch Scottish Tories’ manifesto10:54 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak is expected to appear alongside Douglas Ross to unveil the Tories’ Scottish manifesto.The prime minister and the Scottish Conservative leader are set to make a speech at an event in Edinburgh.Rishi Sunak set to join Douglas Ross to launch Scotland's election campaign manifesto (Getty Images)Ed Davey visits Wimbledon ambulance station10:51 , Jabed AhmedLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey donned overalls and a hi-vis jacket to clean an ambulance during a campaign visit in target seat Wimbledon in south-west London.On his visit to Wimbledon ambulance station, he chatted to staff and stroked post-traumatic stress disorder assistance dog Teddy.The dog was wearing a harness stating “Do not pet”.The Lib Dem leader then used a jet wash to hose down an ambulance, catching watching photographers as the spray bounced off the vehicle.He was making the visit to highlight his warning that there are now just “10 days left to save the NHS”.

High taxes, high debt, struggling public services, make them so. Pressures from health, defence, welfare, ageing will not make them easier.“That is not a reason to hide the choices or to duck them. Quite the reverse. Yet hidden and ducked they have been.”"
Yahoo News UK,Who is Ed Davey? Lib Dem leader attracts attention with election stuntsEverything you need to know about the former minister who has pledged to fight for the NHS.,[],Hannah Fearn,7 June 2024 at 10:47 am·7-min read,7,June,2024,10:47:00,7,"Ed Davey has been involved in a number of comedy stunts since the election was called. (Alamy) With the spotlight on prime minister Rishi Sunak and Labour leader Keir Starmer as they prepare to slug it out in a general election campaign, the focus had started slipping from Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey until a series of stunts put him back in the spotlight.The former coalition government cabinet minister - who lost his seat, punished by voters for getting into bed with the Tories, but then won it back again - is sending a clear message that he should not be overlooked.He’s had a long political career and the climax may still be ahead: if polls continue to shift away from the Conservatives at the current trajectory, there’s a slim possibility that, if the election is held in October, he could end up as Leader of the Opposition.So what do we know about the man behind the third party in British politics? Hannah Fearn finds out.His early lifeEd Davey was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on Christmas Day in 1965. He was the youngest of three boys, but lost his father at just four years old, and his mother followed over a decade later when he was in his mid-teens. She spent three years battling cancer, during which time he nursed his mother together with his grandmother and brother Henry.Once a keen Scout and Air Scout, he later remembers feeling “isolated” at school because of his caring responsibilities, which meant he couldn’t take part in after-school activities or sports. “The last 18 months she was bedridden and in a lot of pain. I’d spend hours on the bed, talking to her,” he said. Davey was with his mother when she died at Nottingham General Hospital, after being placed on an unsuited dementia ward.After both his parents had died, Davey was brought up by his maternal grandparents in the village of Eakring, though his grandfather died soon after. He spent much of his childhood and young adulthood close to his grandmother. “First of all, she was looking after me. Then we were looking after each other,” he said.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election? Full list mappedThe key issues that will decide the electionWhen is the first UK general election TV debate?What is purdah? The strict rule that governs what politicians can and can't sayHis familyDavey married Emily Gasson, a former Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate, in 2005. Gasson stood in four elections but failed to win a seat and is now a councillor. The pair have two children, a son and daughter.Their son, born in 2007 and now a teenager, is disabled with a neurological condition. He attended special schools but is now educated at home with a tutor - a change that Davey said led to him becoming verbal for the first time. He has spoken about his anxiety about who will care for his son when he and his wife are no longer around. “It’s the thing that worries me more than anything else in my life,” he said.Gasson was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in 2012. She was well for many years following her diagnosis, but declined during lockdown and is working on recovering her physical strength.Liberal Democrats election broadcast shows Ed Davey with his son. (Liberal Democrats)His parentsHis father, John, was a solicitor and his mother, Nina, a teacher. Davey has described how he was inspired to study by his mother, who always wanted him to try hard academically and who he wanted to impress.His educationDavey attended the private Nottingham High School, the alma mater of former chancellor Kenneth Clarke. He became head boy, with Labour MP Ed Balls - who was studying in the year below - watching on. After school, he achieved a first class degree in philosophy, politics and economics at Jesus College, Oxford where he was junior common room president. After becoming an economics research for the Liberal Democrats he returned to study, reading for a master’s degree in economics at Birkbeck College, London.Ed Davey, pictured with his family. (Liberal Democrats)Why is he a sir?For three years, the Lib Dem leader was a member of the cabinet during the period of Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, holding the post of secretary of state for energy and climate change from 2012 to 2015. He was knighted in the 2016 New Year’s Honours for “political and public services”.Davey on... the cost of living crisisDavey has repeatedly attacked the government for failing to curb rapid inflation and the devastating effect it is having on household budgets. He called the Conservative Party “so out of touch they might as well be living on another planet”, and said he warned Jeremy Hunt “people are desperate for real help… but all the chancellor could offer is empty words and unfair tax hikes”. In particular, he has urged more action on food price inflation, which analysis from his own party found had risen 37 per cent in one year for the average weekly supermarket trip. He has promised to end energy hikes and abandoned his plan to add 1p to income tax to save the NHS because ordinary voters can no longer afford it.Davey on... the NHSThe Liberal Democrats have made the NHS a cornerstone of their policy platform for the last five years. In Davey’s words: “Voting Conservative is bad for your health.” He promises to reverse cuts to GP numbers and guarantee a doctor’s appointment when you need one, improve access to NHS dentistry and save lives by tackling ambulance call out delays. Davey blames the care crisis for deepening the problems of the health service and says his party would spend £5bn a year on a “care package” to ensure patients are discharged from hospital more quickly, freeing up bed space. However, there is little detail on how this would be financed without raising taxes on the wealthiest - which Davey has promised not to do in his push to poach disillusioned Tory voters.British Leader of the Liberal Democrats party Ed Davey arrives at the BBC Broadcasting House, for his appearance on 'Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg', in London, Britain, April 28, 2024. REUTERS/Maja SmiejkowskaDavey on... immigrationThe Lib Dem leader has been a long-standing advocate for refugee rights and critic of the government’s immigration policy. He has called for Conservative plans to deport failed asylum seekers to Rwanda a “cynical distraction” from the partygate crisis and the money would be better spent on measures to tackle the cost of living crisis. He added: “They’ve provided no evidence to suggest that this new policy will stop illegal smuggling, they’re not cracking down on the organised crime gangs, which is what you need to do.” He has called for a new right to work for refugees and asylum seekers, and major reform of the Home Office which he says is no longer up to the job. After the end of the coalition government, Davey has said his party “was wrong” to go along with the introduction of a minimum income standard for immigrants. He later described the policy as “nasty and unfair”.Davey on... the Post Office scandalDespite the Horizon scandal that led to the wrongful prosecution of more than 700 subpostmasters crossing the tenure of more than a dozen business secretaries, Ed Davey has recently taken the heat for failing to investigate the issue while he was in the job.It has emerged that Davey initially rejected a request to meet justice campaigner Alan Bates, and later accepted it only on the advice that it would be good for his PR. He has recently apologised for not acting earlier, admitting that he is sorry that he “did not see through Post Office lies” about the fault in the Horizon programme."

But can you see the sheer level of hypocrisy?”Firefighters work to extinguish a fire at the site of a Russian missile strike in Odesa (AFP via Getty Images)Mr Farage said he would ""never, ever defend"" Russian President Vladimir Putin.On Friday, Mr Farage told a BBC Panorama special ""we provoked this war"".He said the European Union’s expansion as well as Nato had provided Mr Putin with an “excuse”.Lord Robertson, the former head of Nato, accused Mr Farage of “cuddling up to the Kremlin”.He told LBC it was ""total nonsense"" that the West had provoked Russia into invading Ukraine.He added: “Nigel Farage today has shown his real colours by this sort of, you know, appeasement… One of my successors at NATO… crisply summed it up – if Russia stops fighting, there will be peace.

He said: “You all heard what Nigel Farage said about Ukraine. That plays into Putin’s hands. That kind of appeasement is dangerous for Britain’s security, the security of our allies that rely on us and will only embolden Putin.”In a bid to change tack, Mr Farage tried to switch the conversation to small boat crossings in the Channel.He said: ""Remember I went out four years ago, again and again, into the Channel to highlight what was going on, to say you might as well put a sign on the white cliffs of Dover saying 'everyone welcome'.""He added: ""I warned that huge numbers would come, I even said there might be an invasion, which is of course the rudest word you could possibly use in BBC land, but now 4,000 boats and 128,000 people later, it does look like it's been an invasion to me - and it's mostly young men."""
The Guardian,‘I hope he loses’: Jeremy Hunt facing uphill battle in Godalming as voters long for change,[],Rupert Neate,24 June 2024 at 5:37 am·8-min read,24,June,2024,05:37:00,8,"The beautiful Surrey Hills are well known for two things: a high concentration of some of the UK’s richest residents, who commute from the “stockbroker belt” to well-paying jobs in London, and some of the country’s most popular cycling routes.The two combined on a recent chilly Saturday morning in a 100km bike ride that passed through the picturesque lanes of the newly created Godalming and Ash constituency. Most of the 10 riders from Velo Club Godalming Haslemere were happy to chat politics as they pedalled up (and down) 1,168 metres of the county’s steepest hills on customised carbon-fibre racing bikes, some of which cost more than a family car.Steve Street, 55, a retired engineering consultant who has lived in Godalming for more than 30 years, was excited about the election, as the constituency could be one of the tightest races in the country.“I hope he loses,” Street said of Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, who has held the former seat of South West Surrey since 2005. “I’ve not been that impressed with him, he appears to be a bit of a ‘yes man’ toeing the party line but not doing what makes sense for the country.”InteractiveIf Hunt does lose, he will join a list of just 35 cabinet members who have been defeated while holding office since 1900.In Street’s view, the Conservatives are “no longer the party of business”. They lost him with Brexit, which still makes him angry. “I disagreed with it from the start but as it was the will of the people I agreed we’d better go ahead and do it. But I think it’s been badly implemented and caused so many issues for industry and businesses, and messed up the economy.”Street voted Liberal Democrat in 2019, partly to punish the Conservatives for Brexit. Many others also turned to the Lib Dems, whose share of the vote in the constituency increased from 9.9% in 2017 to 38.7%. Hunt retained the seat with 53.3% and a majority of 8,817.InteractiveThis time pollsters predict it will be one of the closest races in the country, with the Lib Dems’ Paul Follows – the leader of the local Waverley borough council – expected to win with 38%, ahead of Hunt on 33.4%. Under current projections, Labour could come in third with 13.1%, just ahead of Reform on 12.9%.Despite the tightness of the race, Street said he was considering voting Labour this time around. “I’m looking for the party that is going to be pro-business. Labour is pitching itself as very pro-business and I think that could be enough for me to vote for them, maybe.”While Street has earned enough to retire in his early 50s, he said he would like whichever party that wins the election to do more to tackle “the widening gap between rich and poor”.“It’s always talked about as a north-south divide,” he said. “But there are places down south that are very poor. Even here, which is a very rich area, there are pockets of real deprivation.”He said Hunt had “shown himself as out of touch with real people” with his comments earlier this year that £100,000 a year was “not a huge salary”. “It’s such a stupid statement, and it’s the sort of thing that sticks in people’s memories,” Street said.defaultA lot of the voters the Guardian spoke to over several days in the constituency described Hunt as a good local MP, often seen at town and village events and supportive of local charities. The Guardian bumped into Hunt at the annual Godalming town parade and show, at which he repeatedly described himself as “the underdog” in the election.While many voters came up to chat warmly with Hunt and his labrador, Poppy, some challenged him on local, national and international issues, including on the party’s stance on the war in Gaza.Anushka Athique, 42, a lecturer who lives in the neighbouring town of Farncombe, said she “couldn’t pass up the opportunity to speak my mind to him – if I hadn’t I would have gone away feeling a coward”.“I have been writing to him fortnightly about the war in Gaza and the need for an immediate ceasefire,” she said. “He has never replied.”Athique said she hadn’t decided who to vote for “but I’ll do whatever I have to do to get him out”. Asked why, she said: “Just look at every job he has done, every job he has fucked it up: culture secretary, fucked it up; health secretary, really fucked it up; chancellor, the country is bust.”Gaza was also on the mind of Penny Rivers, 67, who has lived in Godalming since 1974. “I’m voting Lib Dem as they are the only major party that has called for an immediate ceasefire,” she said. “We are hoping to have a Labour government and a Lib Dem MP. We hoped for it last time, but this time we are much more hopeful. People are tired and fed up, we need change.”Rivers said people may think of Surrey as “leafy and well-to-do, but people are suffering here just like everywhere else”. She said the cost of living crisis may have hit poorer families in Surrey more than elsewhere as “we have such high housing costs compared to incomes”. “There are now two food banks in Godalming,” she added. “It’s down to austerity and the Tory government.”She said she would like the government to do more for younger people. “We’re old and have had all sorts of advantages that today’s young people can’t imagine. We have four children, all of whom can’t afford to own their own homes despite having good, well-paid jobs.” Her eldest child is 40 and still renting. “We bought our house when I was 24,” she said.Rivers said she knew Hunt well, and she was soon seen giving him a bear hug. “He is a good local MP and has stepped up in various ways,” she said. “But he is part of the national government that has failed the people.”She had one more thing to say before letting go of the Guardian reporter’s arm. “You know the worst thing about this government? It’s the war on woke. Woke means caring for people and it can only be a good thing to care for people no matter what.”Robert Oulton, a Labour party member, was not at the Labour stall at the town fair. Instead he was manning a rival stall calling on people to “vote smart. Vote together. Vote for change … Vote for Paul Follows, the only candidate that can beat the Conservatives here.”Oulton, 70, a retired GP who lives in Farncombe, said he had made the decision in effect to campaign for the Lib Dems because “the country so desperately needs change, we can’t go on like this. We need to get the Tories out, so it has to be tactical voting.”He said he had met a lot of other people who were “on the journey” to tactical voting. “Whether they be Labour or Greens, they are very aware of the situation.”However, Oulton and his fellow activists hadn’t convinced everyone of the merits of tactical voting. Peter Lockhart, 58, who lives in the village of Shalford, near Guildford, is a lifelong Labour member and will be voting for the party’s candidate, James Walsh, on 4 July. “Labour is my community,” Lockhart said. “It chimes with my worldview, despite some frustrations.”Lockhart said he had sympathy with the tactical voting argument but “we want people to vote with their heart”.In the village of Bramley, which was in the midst of a tap water crisis after petrol was found to have leaked into the water supply, Sylvie Thomas, 82, was unafraid to speak frankly. “We’re in so much of a mess, it’s all promises and lies,” Thomas said as she proudly showed off her immaculate home and garden decorated in West Ham United’s claret and blue in memory of her father who played for the team. “They [the Conservatives] have been in too long, it is time for a change.”Max Aiken, 76, an artist and retired architect, didn’t want to vote for any of the candidates on the ballot paper. “I was hoping for something more radical, I’m looking around for someone like [French president Emmanuel Macron], but I’m looking in vain.”Aiken voted Conservative at the last election, but in Bath, and had only recently moved to the village of Cranleigh. “The Tories are promising to fix everything next time, but they have had 14 years and haven’t fixed much,” he said.“I’m not a Lib Dem, and I don’t think [Keir] Starmer is the answer. I don’t think the country knows what the answer is,” he said. “What we really need is someone with a handbag with a brick in it.”"

Check your own constituency to see if it is projected to change handsThe first map above shows the seats won in the 2019 general election, when Boris Johnson led the party to a stunning majority.The wall of Tory blue on the map, compared to the spots of Labour red, is a demonstration of just how far Labour, then led by Jeremy Corbyn, had fallen in public standing. The result was Labour's worst electoral performance since 1935.If you toggle to the second map, the projection by YouGov (which was based on polling carried out between 24 May - 1 June) suggests that Starmer's party is on track to win 422 seats, with the Tories down to just 140.Such a result would be the Conservative Party's worst performance at a general election since 1906. If YouGov's predictions are accurate, Labour winning a 194-seat majority would be the highest number since Conservative Stanley Baldwin won a majority of 208 in 1924.The model suggests the Conservatives could be set for near wipeout across many areas of the country, including London, the North East, the North West, and Wales.It also projects that the Scottish National Party would lose more than half their seats, with Labour returning as the largest party north of the border, and the Liberal Democrats reclaiming its place as the third party of British politics – winning 48 seats.The new figures, released yesterday, came as Reform UK co-founder Nigel Farage announced that he would be returning as the populist party's leader and would stand for election in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. Even before Farage's latest bid, pollsters told Yahoo News that Reform UK could pose a serious threat to the Tories by splitting the vote and potentially handing even more seats to Labour.The YouGov projection follows a similar poll by modelling site Electoral Calculus, which came out on 31 May. The polling also compares the 2019 result with Electoral Calculus' projection.It predicts that Labour is on course to win an even bigger majority of 319 seats - with Starmer's party picking up 485 MPs and the Tories way behind with 66. The modelling shows the Lib Dems getting very close to the Conservative Party, with 59 seats.While Electoral Calculus' polling, based on opinion polls from 8 May to 20 May, returns a different set of projections to YouGov's, both clearly indicate the scale of the problem facing Sunak.The Electoral Calculus model has predicted Sir Keir Starmer's Labour will win a massive majority.

The Telegraph,Sunak and Ross launch manifesto in land where there is still hope,[],Alan Cochrane,24 June 2024 at 11:33 am·4-min read,24,June,2024,11:33:00,4,"In yet another example of how there’s more than one election taking place in Britain, Rishi Sunak has lent his presence to the launch of the Scottish Tories’ manifesto in Edinburgh. In fact the Prime Minister’s attendance was a sort of reminder that the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party is, of course, still a part of the larger UK party. So far.But that formal situation is the only thing currently uniting the two because the campaigning on either side of the Cheviots is entirely different. In the south the Tories are trying desperately to hang onto some sort of respectability in terms of constituencies retained, when the opinion polls are suggesting a massive hammering is on the cards and a hugely reduced number of MPs.Whereas, in Scotland – and for a change, as of now at least – the Tories won’t exactly set the political world on fire but there’s a degree of hope that they might emerge from the July 4 poll with roughly the same number of seats – six – that they secured in 2021.It should be said that the half dozen might not be the same seats, but would be seen as a minor triumph, given the devastation expected to be visited on the party in England.The hope of such an outcome is probably the reason why big-time Tory figures from England are notable only by their absence in this almost exclusively Scottish election. The presence of the prime minister of the United Kingdom during the campaigning is obviously a “must” for the premier party of the Union but there seems to be a view in the Scotland party that “one is enough” in terms of prominent Tory visitors travelling north to join in the campaign. And that one is the PM. No more.The Scottish party is not without its rows and in-fighting, given the abrupt disposal of a candidate in a winnable seat and his replacement by Douglas Ross, the Scottish leader, is a prime example. But it is on a minuscule scale, when compared to the battles, scandals and sleaze that have seemed to emerge regularly in England.Rishi Sunak helps launch the Scottish Conservative manifesto in Edinburgh on Monday - Wattie CheungAs a result bringing senior Cabinet figures north at this present time would be of no benefit in the Scottish party’s fight. Furthermore, and not surprisingly, the issues in Scotland are different from those in England. The SNP’s obsession with independence is the Scottish Tories’ main line of attack, which they say hampers voters’ “real” priorities of education, transport, the NHS and law and order.All of these are devolved to the Scottish Parliament so can’t be fixed by the July 4 election and won’t be sorted by the Tories until they form a government at Holyrood, a situation not likely to occur any time soon.However, the Scottish Tories could do reasonably well on the issue of North Sea oil and gas by cutting through the morass of conflicting policies being offered up by the SNP and Labour. Sunak and Ross want to keep the “black gold” flowing, to protect Britain’s energy future and the well-paid jobs that go with it, whereas their opponents favour drastic reductions and a high tax regimen for the oil companies.Saving the current oil and gas industry from cutbacks and eliminating entirely the SNP’s perpetual – and lone – demand for independence are where the Tories hope they can actually win seats.In an otherwise unexciting manifesto launch, those who like a bit of blood and thunder with their politics heard the prime minister launch into a direct attack on Nigel Farage, whom many Tories on the Right seem to think is their salvation.That’s far from the case in Scotland and Sunak didn’t hold back, claiming that Reform had candidates that were pro-independence and anti-monarchy.Rishi Sunak and Douglas Ross in Edinburgh on Monday - Edward Massey/CCHQAnd regarding Farage’s assertion that the West was partially at fault  for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, he said: “That plays into Putin’s hands. That kind of appeasement is dangerous for Britain’s security, the security of our allies that rely on us, and will only embolden Putin.” Quite right."

The term is also sometimes used to refer to the election itself, as in ‘they could not win at the ballot box’.CampaignThe time before an election in which politicians persuade people to vote for them. In the case of the 2024 election in the UK, parliament was dissolved on the 30 May and the election will take place on 4 July.CanvassingGoing round a particular area trying to persuade people to vote for one party or the other.In UK elections, this is often done by volunteers knocking on people’s doors.Capital gains taxCapital gains tax is a tax on profit when people sell assets that have increased in value.In the 2024 election, the Conservatives have promised that landlords who sell to sitting tenants will be spared capital gains tax on the proceeds, while Labour has left the door open to raising capital gains.Child benefitChild benefit is a benefit paid to parents with children under 16 (or under 20 in approved education or training).The Conservatives have promised to increase the threshold at which high earners start to lose the benefit from £60,000 to £120,000.Sir Keir Starmer, like the Conservatives, has pledged not to raise VAT. (Photo by Stefan Rousseau/PA Images via Getty Images)CoalitionA coalition government is a government formed jointly by more than one political party (for example, by the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives in 2010).ConstituencyThe geographical area that is represented by each MP in the House of Commons.ECHRThe European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is an international convention which protects human rights in Europe.The Conservative manifesto stopped short of promising to withdraw from the ECHR, which would have made plans such as the plan to deport migrants to Rwanda easier.Exit pollA poll conducted outside polling stations just after people have voted on election day.On election day, the results of Britain’s exit poll are published just after polls close at 10pm and tend to give a more accurate prediction of the result than previous polls produced throughout the campaign.First past the postThe first past the post system is used to elect MPs to the House of Commons.The candidate with the most votes in each constituency becomes MP, and the party with the most MPs becomes the government.This can mean that the winning party actually has a minority of votes cast: in 2019, the Conservatives had 43.6% of the vote.Hung parliamentA hung parliament is where no party has enough seats to form an overall majority. For example, both the 2010 election and 2017 elections resulted in hung parliament.In 2010, the Conservatives formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, while in 2017, the Conservatives formed a minority government with a 'confidence and supply' agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).Income tax thresholdThe thresholds between the tax-free allowance, basic rate tax and higher rates of tax.Both parties have said they will continue the freeze on income tax thresholds brought in under the Conservatives, which means people pay more tax as more and more people are pushed into higher tax brackets if wages rise.MajorityA party with a majority – more than half of the seats in the House of Commons – has won the election.The number of votes by which an individual MP wins a constituency is also referred to as their majority.ManifestoPolitical parties publish manifestos before a general election, with a set of policies that the party stands for and aims to implement if elected.Manifesto pledges are not legally binding.Marginal seatA seat in which the incumbent MP won by a small majority, meaning a swing is more likely than in a so-called ‘safe seat’ where the MP had a large majority.Net zeroThe UK Government has set a goal for Britain’s emissions to reach net zero – where emission and removal of greenhouse gases reaches equilibrium – by 2050.All major parties are expected to stick to this goal, barring Reform UK.Opinion pollAn opinion poll is a research survey (usually carried out on a representative sample of the electorate) to gauge likely results in an election.Poll‘The polls’ refers to the places where people vote in an election: exit polls and opinion polls refer to two kinds of survey used to predict election results.Postal voteAn absentee vote where the vote is sent in by post.At the 2019 general election, 17.2% of voters across the UK used a postal ballot.Proxy voteA vote where a person who can’t make it to the booth appoints someone to vote for them.In the 2019 election, 0.6% of voters appointed a proxy.PsephologyPsephology is the scientific study of elections and voting and is used to predict and analyse election results.Polling dayThe day when the country places their vote: in the UK 2024 election, this is July 4.PurdahBefore British elections, the country enters purdah, officially known as the ‘pre-election period of sensitivity’.Purdah means that politicians (both local and national) and other people such as civil servants face restrictions on what they can do and announce.Ministers who remain in office can’t announce new funding, or new policies, or anything which might sway voters or make the government more popular.The idea is that public money cannot be spent on the election.Spoiled ballotA ballot paper which has been marked wrongly (for instance with a vote for more than one candidate) will not be counted.Sometimes people spoil ballots deliberately as a protest vote to show dissatisfactionSwing‘Swing’ is the change in voter support for a political party between one election and the next.It is used to analyse the performance of parties in different areas.Tax burdenThe tax burden refers to the total amount of taxes paid by a group (in this case the UK as a whole) as a proportion of total income.The tax burden is currently at its highest in 70 years according to the OECD.The Equality ActThe 2010 Equality Act protects people against discrimination in Britain.The Conservatives want to ‘tweak’ the Act so that sex-based protections only apply on the basis of someone’s biological sex.Triple lockThe triple lock is a guarantee introduced to the state pension in 2010 so it would not lose value in real terms.The guarantee means that the state pension will rise by the highest out of average earnings, inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) or 2.5%.Triple lock plusThe ‘triple lock plus’ is a Conservative policy, which would see the tax-free pension allowance rise every year in line with the triple lock of average wages, inflation, or 2.5% – whichever is highest, to prevent pensioners being pulled into paying income tax.TurnoutTurnout refers to the percentage of people eligible to vote who turn out to vote on election day.In the 2019 election, for example, 67.3% of those eligible turned out to vote.VATValue added tax is added to goods and services sold by VAT-registered companies, and is the third-largest source of government income after income tax and national insurance.Both Labour and the Conservatives have pledged not to raise VAT.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

Some three-quarters of the Cabinet would lose their seats in that scenario – including Sunak.Were Sunak to lose his seat in Richmond (Yorks), it would make him the first prime minister in history to lose their seat in a general election, according to the Institute for Government. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is also facing a battle to hold on to his constituency, with the vote on a “knife edge”.Savanta spoke to around 18,000 people between 7 June and 18 June for their poll. If reflected in the election, Labour would be on course to win 516 seats, with a commanding Commons majority of 382. The Liberal Democrats would have nearly as many seats (50) as the Tories.Jeremy Hunt: My constituency is on a knife edgeHunt could be among the Conservative casualties on the night of the 4 July poll, despite his newly-created seat in Godalming and Ash currently holding a Conservative majority of more than 10,000. He is facing a battle to win the seat in Surrey, with the Liberal Democrats keen on taking a high-profile scalp.Several other Tory ‘big beasts’ also face a tight vote to hold onto their seat, according to a major poll by Ipsos.Grant ShappsDefence secretary Grant Shapps may lose his seat in the election. (Getty)Defence secretary Grant Shapps, who had been touted as a potential leader of the Conservatives after the election, is at risk of losing his Welwyn Hatfield seat, according to Ipsos. Their polling suggests a likely Labour victory, with Sir Keir Starmer’s party currently on 48%, compared to 28% for the Conservatives.Shapps won the seat in the 2019 election with a vote share of 52.6%, increasing his majority from the previous election.Penny MordauntPenny Mordaunt’s seat is at risk from Labour. (PA)Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons, is another Tory MP whose name has been mentioned in a future leadership contest – in the event of the Tories losing the election. However, she may not even be an MP after 4 July as her Portsmouth North seat is at risk.Seen as “leaning Labour”, polling suggests Labour are on 42%, compared to the Tories on 34%. She won 61.4% of the vote in the 2019 election.Liz TrussFormer prime minister Liz Truss may not be an MP after the election. (PA)Former prime minister Liz Truss is at risk in her South West Norfolk seat. The seat is seen as a “toss up”, with Truss currently in the lead at 31%. Labour are a sitting at 27% but Reform UK are polling 30%.Allowing for margins of error and another two weeks of campaigning, the seat will be hotly contested between all three parties on 4 July.Jacob Rees-MoggJacob Rees-Mogg is on track to lose his seat at the general election. (PA)While no longer a government minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg losing his North East Somerset and Hanham seat would perhaps be one of the night’s bigger surprises. Rees-Mogg has been an outspoken critic of some of Sunak’s policies and is a regular presenter on GB News.However, the Ipsos poll has the seat, which has been newly-created for the 2024 election, is currently showing a “likely Labour” win, with the party on 47%, compared to 30% for the Conservatives.Johnny MercerPolling suggests Johnny Mercer will lose his seat to Labour at the election.

The Guardian,Sunak says Truss’s budget was mistaken as Starmer defends backing of Corbyn,[],Peter Walker and Eleni Courea,24 June 2024 at 1:19 pm·4-min read,24,June,2024,01:19:00,4,"Keir Starmer has defended serving in Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, saying he wanted to help preserve the Labour party and that he “always knew there was going to be a day after”.Speaking in separate interviews hosted by the Sun newspaper that included questions from a watching audience, Rishi Sunak and Starmer underwent at times difficult interrogations, including over migration and the NHS.Both party leaders were quick to dismiss the record of their predecessors. Rishi Sunak said Liz Truss’s economic policy was badly mistaken and claimed that a Starmer-led government would create similar fiscal instability. Starmer meanwhile gave his fullest answer yet as to why he had endorsed Corbyn in the 2019 election when he did not believe in him, and why he did not quit to serve on the backbenches as some colleagues had.“Everybody then took a decision about what they did, how we dealt with this,” he said. “I felt that on issues such as Brexit, which I thought were going to define us for decades to come, leaders are temporary, but political parties are permanent, but it was important to have a voice in the shadow cabinet.“It meant that I could challenge on antisemitism, and it meant that the Labour party never veered from its position on things that are fundamental, like Nato,” he said.The entire Corbyn period was, Starmer said, “very difficult for me and for my party”, but he had to look towards the future.“I knew there would be a day after, where we needed to pick it up, to say to the electorate: ‘In 2019, we got this wrong’, and rebuild – we were all working to that end,” he said. “Everybody knew there was always going to be a day after, when we would have the opportunity for a new party, and to make sure our party was there to face the future.”Sunak sought to argue that Labour would be as damaging to the economy as Truss, as he was challenged about the impact of the short-serving prime minister.Asked if he felt “some responsibility for inflicting Liz Truss on the voters”, Sunak stressed that he had fought Truss for the Conservative leadership and warned against her plans.“I was right then, when I warned about Liz Truss. That’s why all of you can trust me now,” he said. “I have also warned about the damage that Keir Starmer would do to our economy. I was saying something that no one wanted to hear, but I was saying it because I believed it. And I’m telling you again now, it all seems a bit familiar.“If Keir Starmer is your prime minister, the economy is going to suffer and all of you are going to suffer. I don’t want to see that happen.”In another pointed remark, Sunak argued that Labour’s decision to scrap the Rwanda deportation plan for asylum seekers would see a rush in arrivals.“Those illegal migrants will not be on planes to Rwanda,” he said. “They will be out on our streets, putting pressure on public services – and by the way, I can tell you now they are queueing up in Calais, waiting for a Starmer government so they can come here and stay here.”Rishi Sunak stopped off in Chelsea after the debate to deliver a brief stump speech to Tory activists. Greg Hands, a trade minister and former Tory chair who was elected with a 11,000 majority in 2019, is seeking re-election in the west London seat.Sunak told local activists he was “not blind to people’s frustrations with me, with our party”, but said “this election is not a referendum on me”. He said Keir Starmer had “changed his mind on every major position that he has taken, including just the other day U-turning on his U-turning about supporting Jeremy Corbyn” and accused the Labour leader of threatening the security of women with his policy on transgender rights."

Yahoo News UK,"Three important UK election issues, explainedRishi Sunak said his leadership is needed in 'uncertain' times. Keir Starmer said the country needs to be 'rebuilt'. So what issues do voters care about most?","['The economy', 'Health', 'Immigration and asylum']",James Cheng-Morris,Updated 28 May 2024 at 10:11 am·5-min read,28,May,2024,10:11:00,5,"After months of speculation, Rishi Sunak confirmed the general election will be held on 4 July.The prime minister said Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer could not be trusted to lead the country through “uncertain” times. He made the economy and combating global security the key elements of his pitch to the nation as he announced the election date.In response, Starmer told voters: “Together we can stop the chaos, we can turn the page, we can start to rebuild Britain.”But amid this “uncertainty” and need to “rebuild”, what do the voters consider the key issues?This chart, produced using YouGov polling over the course of this parliament, offers an insight in the issues voters care most about and how that has ebbed and flowed over time.Compared to when Boris Johnson's Tories won the December 2019 poll, the economy, immigration, defence and tax have grown in importance in the eyes of the electorate. This has come amid the cost of living crisis; small boats crossing the English Channel; the onset of the Ukraine war and wider global instability; and the highest tax burden in 70 years.Housing has also become a bigger concern, with the Renters Reform Bill - in which the government pledged to scrap no-fault evictions - having been paused after Sunak called the election.Meanwhile, the last general election was fought - and won by the Tories - on a single issue: Brexit. Yet the chart shows a clear downturn in its relevance among voters, particularly after a trade deal was agreed with the EU in December 2020.This next chart, meanwhile, highlights what voters have considered the top issues over the past year. By a wide margin, the top three are the economy, health and immigration and asylum.Here, Yahoo News UK breaks down what is behind these issues and how they have ebbed and flowed in importance among voters since the last election in 2019.The economyThe unprecedented lockdown called by Boris Johnson in March 2020 meant the public’s attention shifted to the economy, as demonstrated by the huge spike in the chart above. The then-chancellor Rishi Sunak was forced to implement a £70bn furlough scheme, lasting 18 months, to protect people’s jobs.There was a second almighty economic shock - and rise in public concern - in February 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This caused a further spike in an already turbulent wholesale energy market, driving up costs for suppliers and ultimately customers.Average energy bills eventually reached £2,500 a year (and would have exceeded £4,000 had the government not intervened). This was double the £1,278 consumers were paying before the war and by the time this election takes place, people will still be paying much more than this: £1,568.Energy prices were also a key driver in inflation reaching 11.1% - a 41-year high - by October 2022, though it has since fallen to 2.3%, which is near the Bank of England’s 2.0% target.The third economic shock of this parliament - and most damaging for the Tories - was in October 2022 when Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng's disastrous “mini budget”, containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, prompted an economic crisis. It led to soaring interest rates, and to this day homeowners who are remortgaging are facing significantly higher bills.HealthHealth, like the economy, is another issue which clearly correlated with the beginning of the pandemic. The above chart shows an enormous spike in public concern when COVID cases started to multiply in March 2020, ultimately leading to the nationwide lockdown as the NHS faced collapse.Cases fell that summer, but spikes in the chart can be seen once infections rose again and fresh nationwide lockdowns were imposed in October 2020 and January 2021. By March 2022, likely as concerns over the Omicron variant faded, there was much less concern about health.In January last year, there was a brief spike as the NHS in England experienced the biggest industrial action in its history, with tens of thousands of nurses and ambulance staff walking out simultaneously.As for the state of play going into the election, NHS waiting lists remain higher than they were when Sunak vowed to cut them last year. According to the latest figures, an estimated 7.54 million treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of March, relating to 6.29 million patients.Immigration and asylumSince the last election, the immigration and asylum narrative has largely revolved around one issue: small boats crossing the English Channel.The numbers have risen in most of the intervening years: there were 1,843 crossings in 2019, 8,466 in 2020, 28,526 in 2021, 45,774 in 2022 and 29,437 last year. This year, the number has already passed the 10,000 mark.The regular sharp spikes in the above chart demonstrate how frequently crossings have been in the news, including some occasions when hundreds of migrants have made the dangerous journey in a single day.But it also reflects how the government has made this part of its own agenda. It was Boris Johnson’s government which first announced plans to deport migrants to Rwanda in April 2022. That policy was picked up by Rishi Sunak when he became prime minister in October that year, with Sunak since repeating his pledge to “stop the boats”.But after calling the election, Sunak admitted this week that flights would not take off before the country goes to the polls.Read moreFive important laws that could be dropped due to Sunak's snap election (Yahoo News UK)OPINION - Rishi Sunak has been in last-ditch campaign mode for so long — a General Election is logical (Evening Standard)Door open for Boris Johnson to campaign for Tories, Rishi Sunak signals (PA Media)"
The Telegraph,Badenoch hints at Tory leadership bid after election,[],Dominic Penna,24 June 2024 at 9:50 am·2-min read,24,June,2024,09:50:00,2,"Kemi Badenoch has hinted at a potential Conservative leadership bid after the general election.The Business Secretary said there was “no better job” than her current frontbench role, but suggested she would be interested in the leadership if the party loses the election next Thursday.The bookmakers’ favourite to succeed Rishi Sunak came fourth in the contest to take over from Boris Johnson in July 2022.Speaking at a Bloomberg debate with Jonathan Reynolds, her Labour counterpart, Mrs Badenoch said: “I’m already the Secretary for Business and Trade, and it’s actually been the job of a lifetime.“I love it – there’s no better job. It is a lot easier and a lot less pressured than being prime minister. The fact of the matter is I stood and I lost, and what terrifies me now is not not becoming leader, it is seeing Labour come in.“This is one of the things that I’ve found most difficult doing this job, that people tend not to know what it is because I’m always asked the leadership question. We’re so interested in the personalities, in the gossip and so on.“We need to focus on this election. The choice is going to be between us or between them. Be afraid if it is them is all I would say. And we will talk about leadership things after an election, but not before.”Mrs Badenoch has previously hit out at those on the Tory Right who unsuccessfully plotted against Mr Sunak earlier this year.Some of the rebels wanted to see her installed as leader prior to a general election, but she insisted the Prime Minister had her “full support” and told those agitating for his downfall to “stop messing around”.A seat-by-seat poll by Savanta for The Telegraph last week suggested Mrs Badenoch would be the only “big beast” left standing after the election, with hopefuls including Penny Mordaunt, James Cleverly and Grant Shapps projected to lose their seats.The poll suggested the Tories would retain just 53 seats, with Labour predicted to win a record-breaking peacetime majority of 382.Last week, Mrs Badenoch claimed Labour would reverse Brexit if it wins on July 4 and that Britain’s departure from the European Union should be a “10 to 20-year project” – which she said would be put at risk by Sir Keir Starmer becoming prime minister.In an interview with The Telegraph, she said she understood why voters on the Right were “frustrated” with the Conservatives but urged them not to back Nigel Farage’s Reform UK."
Yahoo News UK,"Will Nigel Farage's Reform UK 'beat' the Tories in the election?With some polling figures putting the Tories and Reform UK nearly neck and neck, could Farage's party really end up with nearly as many MPs as Sunak's?","['What do the latest polls say?', 'Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?', 'Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?', 'What is proportional representation?']",James Cheng-Morris and  Ellen Manning,Updated 14 June 2024 at 5:33 am·7-min read,14,June,2024,05:33:00,7,"Leading pollster John Curtice has poured cold water on suggestions that Reform UK is now beating the Conservative Party in the general election polls.As representatives from seven parties took prepared to take part in a TV debate on Thursday, a YouGov survey for The Times newspaper said Reform’s support had increased by two points to 19%, putting them ahead of the Tories for the first time.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage took the the opportunity to hail the poll results in the debate, declaring: “We are now the opposition to Labour.”But Curtice urged caution, insisting that single polls should not be relied on. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""This is one poll - we’ve actually, I think, had four other polls published in the last 24 hours - none of which have had Reform ahead, not even all of which have had Reform gaining ground, but quite a couple of them certainly suggesting it’s also got very close.""He said it may not be the case that Reform are ahead - and could be on average four or five points behind. But he said: ""This is still bad news for the Conservatives. The only way Rishi Sunak can hope to get even to base camp in narrowing the lead that Labour have started off with this campaign was to squeeze the Reform vote.""He added: ""Rather than making progress, things are actually going backwards, not least of course because of Nigel Farage’s decision to fight this campaign.""With many speculating that Reform UK with Farage at the helm could ""beat"" the Tories, Yahoo News UK takes a look.What do the latest polls say?YouGov’s voting intention tracker, updated on Tuesday, suggests the Tories and Reform UK are neck and neck.With Labour well ahead on 38%, the Tories are trailing on 18% – compared to a high of 53% under Boris Johnson in 2020 – with Reform UK just behind on 17% and the Liberal Democrats on 15%.However, there are multiple polls taking place at any one time by a number of different companies.According to the PA news agency, an average of all polls that were carried out wholly or partly during the seven days to June 13 puts Labour on 43%, 21 points ahead of the Conservatives on 22%, followed by Reform on 14%, the Lib Dems on 10% and the Greens on 6%.And while Reform’s average is up one percentage point on the figure for the previous week and the Tories are down one point, there is still an eight-point gap, on average, between the two.Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?Unless something remarkable happens, in short: 'No' - and that's because of the first past the post (FPTP) voting system in which the candidate with the largest number of votes in their constituency is elected.According to the Electoral Reform Society, which is against FPTP, this system leads to a situation where “even if millions of voters support the same party, if they are thinly spread out across the UK they may only get the largest number of votes in a couple of these contests – so only win a few MPs"".“Tens of thousands of voters supporting a different party, but who live near each other, could end up with more MPs. This means the number of MPs a party has in parliament rarely matches their popularity with the public.”Rishi Sunak on the campaign trail on Wednesday. (AFP via Getty Images)Farage knows this well. As the leader of UKIP in the 2015 election, he saw his party win 12.6% of the nationwide vote and one seat. The Liberal Democrats won 7.9% of the vote... and eight seats.Indeed, YouGov last week released a poll – put together using the multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) surveying technique, from a sample size of nearly 60,000 respondents – which suggested the Tories would win just 140 seats, having won 365 in 2019. But this is still 140 more than the zero it projected Reform UK to win, in spite of its strong polling figures.The model had Reform UK ""performing strongly in a number of seats but still a long way off winning in any"", with projected second-placed finishes in 27 constituencies.YouGov's MRP projection. (YouGov)Granted, this model was formed between 24 May and 1 June, before Farage's headline-grabbing intervention on Monday last week in which he announced he would be standing as an MP.But, even as Reform UK polls closer than ever to the Tories, it's difficult to imagine the party winning more than a handful of seats.Chris Hopkins, director at polling firm Savanta, told Yahoo News UK that in one respect, Reform UK is at an advantage compared to Ukip in 2015 because ""Ukip took votes from both Labour and the Conservatives, and we are not seeing that with Reform UK – they are all coming from the Conservatives.""That is the consequence of Rishi Sunak making immigration a centrepiece of the campaign and failing to deliver on it. Even if you have voters that are neutral on immigration, they would say the small boats policy has been a disaster.""But even so, Hopkins said, Reform UK is still ""at a huge electoral disadvantage"" in that its votes are not very concentrated, they are very evenly spread.""There are going to be some races where Reform UK is strong - the Nigel Farage factor in Clacton is really interesting - but realistically its ceiling is five seats: and that’s a high ceiling.""Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey on a campaign visit in Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire, on Wednesday. (PA)Like Reform UK, Sir Ed Davey’s Liberal Democrats are performing well in the polls.In a sign of how defensive the Tory campaign is becoming, one online party advert claims voting for Reform UK or the Lib Dems could give Labour 100 extra seats, resulting in the biggest majority in its history.It depicts a scenario where the Conservatives are beaten into third place behind the Lib Dems, with just 57 seats, despite getting 19% of the vote and without Reform winning a single seat.Read more: Pollsters got it wrong in 2015, so could Labour’s lead be overestimated? (The Guardian)However, it remains unlikely the Lib Dems will finish second. YouGov’s MRP poll projected the party performing strongly, winning 48 seats. This would be up 37 from 2019, but still nowhere near the Tories’ projected 140.However, amid all this talk about projections, it’s worth remembering they are still only polls and not a definite indicator of how people will vote on 4 July. The 1992 and 2015 elections are notable examples of how polling didn’t match the end results of Tory wins.What is proportional representation?Proportional representation, as defined by the UK parliament, is an electoral system ""in which the distribution of seats corresponds closely with the proportion of the total votes cast for each party. For example, if a party gained 40% of the total votes, a perfectly proportional system would allow them to gain 40% of the seats.""This differs from the first past the post system, as set out above, in that a relatively high vote share rarely corresponds with increased seats for the smaller parties. In 2019, for example, the Lib Dems won 11.5% of the vote but only 1.7% – 11 – of the 650 seats.Unsurprisingly, both Reform UK and the Lib Dems support proportional representation.The Lib Dems this week made it part of their manifesto, with the party saying it would introduce the single transferrable vote method, a form of proportional representation which allows electors to rank their preference of candidates on the ballot.The party previously sought to change the UK’s voting system while in the coalition government under then-leader Nick Clegg, but voters rejected the plan in a 2011 referendum.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

The polls have consistently painted a very bleak picture for the prime minister, with Labour holding on to a double-digit poll lead over his Conservatives.Recent by-election results suggest that Labour is likely to win a landslide victory – but there’s still time for the PM to turn it around.Here’s everything you need to know about Sunak and what’s he’s saying about the biggest issues in British politics right now.Early lifeSunak was born in Southampton in 1980, the eldest of three children. His Indian parents both arrived from East Africa in the 1960s. A football-mad boy whose childhood idol was Matt Le Tissier, Sunak was described by the family’s neighbours as a child with “lovely manners”.In his youngest years, the PM attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. According to a recent biography, fellow pupil Ollie Case said: “He was someone that was talked about. The teachers would say: ‘He’s going to be prime minister'.""But, growing up in the 1980s and 90s, he also remembers experiencing racism. “My mother was obsessed with us not having accents,” Sunak has said.Rishi Sunak was football-mad as a boy growing up in Southampton. (ITV)Sunak's familySunak is married to Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian entrepreneur and multi-billionaire. The pair first met in 2004 at Stanford University, his future wife apparently attracted to his “honesty and integrity”.Five years later they married in a two-day Indian wedding held in Bangalore. The couple have two daughters, Krishna and Anoushka, who will turn 13 and 11 this year, both of whom are largely kept out of the public eye.Sunak attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. (Rishi Sunak, Instagram)His parentsYashvir Sunak, Rishi’s father, was born in Kenya. He arrived in the UK to study medicine and then stayed, becoming an NHS GP. His mother, Usha, was born in Tanzania and is a pharmacist.The couple met in Britain and settled in Southampton in the 1970s. Usha is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.His educationAs a teenager Sunak studied at Winchester College where he was, he says, a self-confessed “geek”. According to a recent biography, the “naughtiest” thing the prime minister did during his school days “was to smuggle a hand-held television into the school so that he did not miss any key games of Euro 96”.The childhood home of Rishi Sunak in Southampton. (Getty Images, photo taken in 2022)Perhaps unsurprisingly for someone with such an unblemished record, he went on to become the school’s head boy. Sunak worked while studying, delivering medicines for his mother’s pharmacy and as a waiter at a local Indian restaurant.After school, Sunk read philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, graduating in 2001 with a first class degree. While still at university he held an internship at the Conservative Party campaign headquarters and joined the party, but went on studying before entering politics.He earned his MBA from Stanford in 2006 as a Fulbright Scholar, meaning he was selected among the most promising candidates from the UK.How much is he worth?As prime minister, Rishi Sunak earns £80,807 on top of a salary of £84,144 for being an MP. But his current income from Westminster pales in comparison to his family’s vast wealth through marriage.The Sunday Times valued the couple’s joint fortune at £730m. Murty's father is the co-founder of Infosys, an Indian tech conglomerate, in which she holds shares estimated at around £430m. Her family is also involved in a £900m business arrangement with Amazon in India, and she is a shareholder of multiple other companies.Rishi Sunak's mother is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.Before entering politics Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and a series of hedge funds. He is also known to have invested in blind trusts, in which investments are made without holders knowing where the funds are located. These arrangements reportedly hold Sunak’s own multi-million-pound fortune.His religionSunak is not only the first prime minister of colour and of Indian heritage but he is also the first practising Hindu to hold the biggest job in UK politics.He has spoken of his pride in his Hindu faith, saying, “that’s how I was raised, and that’s how I am”. He said: “Having faith gives you resilience, gives you strength that is important and it provides an outlook on life which I find particularly valuable.”Sunak on... the NHSThe prime minister’s biggest challenge in office has been the crisis in the NHS - and to many people in the sector his government has been found wanting. “We have not made enough progress,” Sunak said when asked about his commitment to cut NHS waiting lists during an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV. Asked if that meant he had failed, the prime minister replied: “Yes, we have.""Sunak expects to see waiting lists start to reduce this spring, and blames the delays on “industrial action”, as disputes with junior doctors and consultants over pay and conditions continue. Yet Sunak himself has been blamed for holding up a deal that would prevent more walkouts.Sunak, his wife Akshata and daughters Anoushka and Krishna (second left) at Santa Monica Pier, California, on their summer holiday in 2023. (AP)Sunak on… immigrationAccording to the prime minister, illegal migration threatens to “overwhelm” Europe. In June 2023 he claimed his plan to “stop the boats” and tackle illegal immigration was working, but by August 2023 he had changed his mind: “It’s not an easy problem to fix,” he told broadcasters. “I never said we would be able to solve it overnight.”He has staked much of his reputation on the government's Rwanda Bill - his plan to deport asylum seekers to the east African country that finally became law last month, after months of legal and procedural challenges. It has paved the way for deportation flights to get off the ground within weeks.He described his policy, which he says will act as a deterrent to people traffickers, as being “the will of the people” – yet polling suggests low support for such a punitive approach.The policy, coupled with Conservative talk of limits on legal migration, shows that the government is committed to taking a hard line on the issue, despite the risk of alienating more moderate voters.The Rwanda policy is not universally popular. (YouGov)Sunak on... the cost of living crisisThe prime minister has told hard-pressed working families that they will feel some relief from the cost of living crisis as inflation continues to drop following its highs of October 2022. He described the government’s tax cuts as “meaningful” and has welcomed the dip in mortgage rates at the turn of the year.Sunak says falling inflation will have the biggest impact on family budgets “and will start to ease some of those pressures” and that he was right to focus on that figure. However, the global drop in energy prices is probably the biggest factor in easing the hit on wallets - something that the prime minister has no control over.However, the fall in inflation to 2.3% on 22 May this year – the lowest it has been in nearly three years – was likely one of the key factors in persuading Sunak to call a snap election many weeks earlier than experts had predicted.Can we expect more handouts or tax breaks to help balance family budgets? Not according to Sunak, who has warned voters that it’s time to “move on” from government support.Sunak on... pensionsThe triple-lock pensions policy is a tricky one for Sunak – especially since Labour has committed to retaining the policy. Any change to a policy that has become a hallmark of recent Conservative governments would not go down well with the 12 million pensioners it would likely impact – many of whom are lifelong Tory voters.Last November, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said pensions should start being pegged to an average of inflation and wage growth, which would help reduce state spending over time.Sunak’s response to that was ambiguous to say the least: “We are the government that has … delivered the triple lock and it is why, right now, pensions are, depending on how you look at it, £800 or £900 bigger than they otherwise would have been.” He is yet to confirm whether it will appear in the manifesto."
Yahoo News UK,"Who is Richard Tice? Reform’s former leader turned Farage sidekickThe candidate for Hartlepool has seen his party's popularity swell in recent months, with one poll showing reform ahead of the Conservatives.",[],Andrew Naughtie,Updated 14 June 2024 at 5:45 am·6-min read,14,June,2024,05:45:00,6,"Now that Nigel Farage has taken over as the leader of Reform UK, Richard Tice’s public profile is fading fast - but the Reform chairman remains involved in the party's operations.So far, the party has only one MP, Conservative defector Lee Anderson. But a recent poll has shown Reform overtaking the Tories, raising the possibility Anderson could hold his seat and even end up with fellow Reformers in the next Parliament.As the candidate for Hartlepool, where he stood as the Brexit Party candidate in 2019, Tice hopes to be one of them. So who is he, and what does he stand for?Childhood and educationBorn in Surrey in 1964 to James Tice, a showjumper, and Joan Tice, a horse trainer. Educated at the private boarding school Uppingham, he studied at the University of Salford, gaining a degree in construction economics and quantity surveying – teeing him up for a career that he said would ""continue the family genes in the property industry"".Family (partner & kids)Tice has three children from a 24-year marriage that ended in divorce. He is now in a long-term relationship with the right-wing writer and journalist Isabel Oakeshott.She is perhaps best known for two notorious incidents that set her against leading Tories: a book that featured the heavily disputed allegation that David Cameron had engaged in sexual activity with a pig, and the release of embarrassing messages entrusted to her by Matt Hancock when she agreed to write a book with him.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election? Full list mappedThe key issues that will decide the electionWhen is the first UK general election TV debate?What is purdah? The strict rule that governs what politicians can and can't sayNet worthWhile not quite in the same league as Rishi Sunak, Tice is one of the wealthiest people in British politics. As he describes it on his website, he made his multi-million-pound fortune over the course of “30 years of making things happen in property investment”, starting with a graduate job at a London firm in 1987.According to Tice, the company he leads as CEO, Quidnet Capital, has “bought and managed £500 million in commercial properties across the UK on behalf of clients”.He was also a key figure in the redevelopment of London’s Nine Elms district, near Battersea Power Station, a controversial project that has transformed a stretch of the Thames’s south bank with a welter of rapidly erected high-rise blocks.GB News linksAlong with Nigel Farage, Lee Anderson and several MPs on the right flank of the Tory party, Tice is a regular on the hard-right, culture war-focused TV outlet GB News. There he hosts a programme called “Richard Tice’s Sunday Sermon”, which serves as a platform for him to deliver his political analysis without the interruptions of an interviewer.However, despite the network being a relatively safe space for him in ideological terms, Tice’s appearances aren’t always amicable. A recent interview with host Andrew Pierce, a longtime right-wing commentator, saw him challenged fiercely about Reform’s chances in a summer election should one be called – with Pierce pointing to the “weirdos” selected by the party to fight numerous seats as evidence the party is “not ready”.Richard Tice, pictured in 2018 at a 'Leave Means Leave' campaign event, is focused on the issue of immigration. (Steve Finn/WENN)Tice was also involved in an incident that saw the network deemed in breach of broadcasting regulator Ofcom’s impartiality regulations, specifically an interview in which a former Brexit Party MEP failed to “sufficiently challenge” his views on immigration.The regulator is under increasing pressure to crack down on GB News heading into the election, with critics arguing it cannot be allowed to broadcast shows that feature Tory and Reform MPs interviewing each other without alternative points of view represented.Tice on NHSThe state and future of the NHS set to be one of this election’s main battlegrounds, and Reform’s key health policy is to spend £17 billion on the NHS on top of its current budget in an effort to get waiting lists down to zero. It also proposes introducing tax relief on private healthcare – something that has been criticised by opponents as a creeping step towards the privatisation of healthcare writ large.Tice’s stated rationale is that the reason the service is struggling is because the money it needs is being spent on other things that the public do not in fact support. Top of the list is Net Zero, which the party and its predecessors have long decried as a pointless “woke” project.In April, Tice used a press conference to frame the choice starkly. “We have a choice in this country, it seems to me,” he said. “A pretty clear choice. Do we want zero waiting lists in two years, and to keep them there? That is the Reform choice. Or do we want net zero CO2 emissions in 25 years? That is the Labour choice.”Tice on immigrationImmigration is by far Reform UK’s top issue, with the party looking to build on Farage’s two decades of campaigning against it in its legal and illegal forms.As far as the election goes, Tice and the party are targeting the continuing arrival of small boats of people travelling across the English Channel, many of them seeking asylum. He has criticised the government for failing to stop “mass immigration” post-Brexit, and described Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda policy as “a disaster”, arguing on GB News that its supposed deterrent value was revealed to be zero just hours after the House of Commons finally passed the law.Reform chairman Richard Tice (L) and leader Nigel Farage speak at the party's economic policy launch at Church House in London. (Alamy Live News)“Within a matter of hours more boats, absolutely packed full, overfilled with illegal migrants, were setting off from the beaches. And we learnt on Tuesday morning that sadly five people, including a young child, drowned leaving the beaches. That's not a deterrent. That's an absolute disaster.”Instead of deporting people to Rwanda, he is arguing for a “pick up and take back” policy that would see small boat arrivals deposited back on French soil. As evidence that this is both practical and humane, he has cited similar policies deployed in the US and Australia.However, he has not addressed the fact that Australia’s policy has been criticised internationally for leaving so-called “boat people” confined to facilities on the island of Nauru, where there have been incidents of suicide and self-immolation.Tice on cost of living crisisPerhaps unsurprisingly given he is trying to peel away former Tory voters, Tice has criticised recent Tory prime ministers harshly for overseeing Britain’s intense cost of living crisis. In 2022, he accused then-prime minister Boris Johnson of “waffling” over the situation. “Clueless, out of touch, no ideas, no help,” he tweeted. “Shocking.”He has also warned that the prospect of a “disastrous” Labour government will offer no prospect of meaningful relief for struggling households.Instead, Reform proposes lifting the minimum level of income tax to £20,000 while cutting various other taxes – among them fuel duty, another gesture to the party’s rejection of environmentalism as a top priority."

Many also assume his title is hereditary.So what do you really need to know about the man who, on current poll ratings, is set to be the UK’s next prime minister?His early lifeKeir Starmer was born in Southwark, south London, in 1962, as the second of four children. His parents were Labour Party members and named him after Keir Hardie, the party’s first leader in parliament.The family moved out of the capital and he grew up in Hurst Green, a village just outside the small Surrey town of Oxted. He was active in youth politics from his teenage years but was also a skilled musician, taking music lessons alongside Norman Cook, who later became better known as a member of The Housemartins and the DJ Fatboy Slim.Starmer played the flute, piano, violin and recorder and was a junior exhibitioner at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.His familyStarmer is married to Victoria, a former solicitor who later retrained in occupational health and now works for the NHS. The pair met through their work in the law in the early 2000s and married in Essex in 2007.She was first seen accompanying her husband when the couple were filmed clapping for carers during the pandemic in 2020 outside their home in Camden. They have two children, a son and daughter, but both are kept out of the public eye.Victoria's father was Jewish and originally came from Poland, while her mother converted when they got married. Starmer has said in a previous interview that ""my wife in particular wants our children to know the faith of her family"" and that they ""observe some of the practices, for example Friday night prayers"".Keir Starmer with parents, Rodney and Josephine, at his graduation. (Twitter/Keir Starmer)His parentsThe Labour leader's father, Rodney Starmer, worked as a toolmaker in a factory, and his mother Josephine Starmer (née Baker), was a nurse.His father worked long, 14-hour days but spent his time outside work caring for Josephine, who was diagnosed with the autoimmune condition Still’s disease. She required two hip and knee replacements twice in her lifetime and struggled with arthritic pain.As a young man Starmer also helped care for his mother, which he has said led to him being more emotionally reserved. His sister, Katy, recalled: “He’s had to be a grown-up all his life. I’ve always been quite open about my feelings – Keir is good at most things, but not that.” Josephine Starmer died in 2015, and his father three years later.His educationStarmer passed the 11-plus examination, and attended Reigate Grammar School from age 11. While he was at the school it became an independent fee-paying institution, but as an existing student he was exempt from fees, and his tuition in the sixth form was covered by a bursary.After school he studied law at the University of Leeds, this first in his family to attend university, graduating with a first class degree in 1985. He undertook postgraduate law studied at the University of Oxford, where he served as editor of a radical magazine, Socialist Alternatives.A photograph of a younger Starmer as shown on ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories in 2021. (ITV)Why is he a sir?Stamer was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 2014 in recognition of his work in the legal profession, culminating in a five-year term as Director of Public Prosecutions.He first became a barrister in 1987 at the Middle Temple, later joining Doughty Street Chambers and was appointed a Queen’s Counsel in 2002, aged just 39. In 2008 he was appointed head of the Crown Prosecution Service and DPP.During his tenure he chose to prosecute three Labour MPs and a Conservative in the wake of the parliamentary expenses scandal, and was responsible for prosecuting former MP Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce for perverting the course of justice after Pryce claimed responsibility for her former husband’s speeding offence.Starmer on... the NHSThe Labour leader has said that, if elected, his government would “get the NHS working around the clock and pay staff properly to do it”.The remark followed a commitment to provide £1.1bn in funding for the health service to cut waiting lists by paying doctors and nurses to carry out additional out-of-hours care, which would be funded by axing tax breaks for wealthy “non-doms” who hoard money overseas. He added: “The Conservative Party that brought our NHS to its knees will put it in the ground. We have to get it back on its feet.”Starmer describes the NHS as “the crowdfunded solution for all of us”, reinforcing his commitment to healthcare being free at the point of use, but says reform is inevitable or the health service would “remain on life support”. He has pledged to integrate up-to-date technology into every part of the NHS including using artificial intelligence to diagnose disease earlier and more accurately.He supported the doctors strikes, telling ministers: “Don’t break junior doctors, talk to them. Get in the room [and] sort it out.”Starmer with his wife, Lady Victoria Starmer, at the Labour Party Conference in October 2023.

Starmer has said a Labour government would set up a new policy unit to tackle illegal migration and has suggested that a returns agreement for asylum seekers could be negotiated with the European Union to solve the small boats crisis.He described the government’s thwarted Rwanda plan, which would see illegal migrants deported to the African nation but has to be put into practice due to legal blocks, as a “gimmick” and a “farce” and has promised to reverse it.Starmer on... the cost of living crisisStarmer has sought to keep Rishi Sunak’s handling of the cost of living crisis in the minds of voters by claiming that “his fingerprints are all over their struggling household budgets”. In a letter to his shadow cabinet, leaked to The Guardian, he wrote: “Rishi Sunak is the chief architect of choices prioritising the wealthiest and of the government’s failure to get a grip of the economy and get growth going.”He has said he would prioritise tackling inflation, blaming it for putting up prices and eroding household savings, but has pledged to “take the difficult and responsible decisions” to bring it down.Starmer pictured in 2010, when he was director of public prosecution at the CPS, making a statement about MPs who face charges over their expenses claims. (Getty)Starmer on... private schoolsLabour has dropped its early promise to scrap charitable status for private schools, but has committed to levying a 20% VAT rate on school fees removing their “unfair tax break”. The money raised, he said, will be used to address the “appalling state” of the school system for all children.“It’s not an attack on private schools. It’s just saying an exemption you have had is going to go,” he warned private schools who have been critical of the plan – reminding them they are not obliged to pass that tax on to parents in the form of increased fees.Starmer on… the House of LordsWhen he was first Labour leader, Starmer proposed a “root and branch reform of the centre of government… rooting out unearned privilege and addressing unaccountable power”.But his promise to scrap the House of Lords within the first four years of a new parliament - a controversial move that caused a split among his party’s grandees, has been abandoned.Starmer still backs plans for a second chamber “electoral legitimacy”, but as his party nears government he has stepped away from the most radical form of that pledge. He is now reportedly committed to cutting the number of hereditary peers, reducing the size of the chamber and introducing a new appointments process."
