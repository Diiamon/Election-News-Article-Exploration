The Telegraph,Sunak looked like a man who was running the country - until he wobbled,[],Gordon Rayner,21 June 2024 at 5:29 am·3-min read,21,June,2024,05:29:00,3,"Had this been a presidential election, Rishi Sunak would have come away from the Question Time debate feeling he had a good chance of winning.Where the audience made it clear to Sir Keir Starmer that they did not trust him, with Mr Sunak it was his party and his predecessors that they disliked, rather than him.Unfortunately for the Prime Minister, Britain does not have a directly elected leader, meaning the problems that have stacked up over the past 14 years, rather than the past 18 months under his premiership, will be what loses him the election, if the polls are right.Mr Sunak seemed more positive than of late, he spent less time apologising, he smiled and he seemed to connect with the audience better than Sir Keir had done.He also showed a welcome flash of steel when he was asked about the gambling allegations overshadowing the Tory campaign, telling the audience: “If anyone is found to have broken the rules I will make sure that they are booted out of the Conservative Party.”For a change, he looked like the man who was running the country, rather than a luckless challenger.There was, however, a wobble, and it came when he was pressed on the issue of compulsory national service, one of the Conservatives’ most eye-catching policies.How, Fiona Bruce asked, would he force young people to national service?“Sorry?” he spluttered, as if it was the first time he had been asked to consider it.There are a range of things other countries do to enforce national service, he said: driving licences, access to finance…Was he suggesting that anyone who did not do national service would be banned from driving? Or have their bank accounts closed? It certainly sounded like it.No no, he insisted - a Royal Commission would look at all of the alternatives and report back.He recovered from that and told the audience member who asked about trusting him to do better: “My grandparents came to this country with very little and I’m standing here as Prime Minister. I owe an enormous debt of gratitude to this country and I’m in this because of what this country has done for my family.”On the issue of whether Britain should leave the European Convention on Human Rights if it stood in the way of the Rwanda scheme, he said he would put the security of the country first and “I make no apology for that”.Several people in the audience shouted “shame!” but those back at Tory HQ are unlikely to have cared about that.They already know that committed Labour supporters don’t like the Rwanda scheme, and they will also know that for those concerned about immigration, seeing Mr Sunak standing up to them might just have won him back a few more votes from people flirting with Reform UK."
The Independent,"Jeremy Corbyn would have been better PM than Boris Johnson, says Keir Starmer",[],Alexander Butler,21 June 2024 at 6:16 am·2-min read,21,June,2024,06:16:00,2,"Jeremy Corbyn would have made a better prime minister than Boris Johnson had he been elected in 2019, Sir Keir Starmer said.Sir Keir dodged a series of questions during a BBC Question Time debate on Thursday night over whether he truly believed his predecessor would have made a “great” prime minister, as he said five years ago.Host Fiona Bruce repeatedly challenged him over his one-time statement, with Sir Keir insisting: “It wasn’t a question that really arose because I didn’t think we were going to win the election.”Follow live updates hereBut when Bruce asked for a “yes” or “no” answer to whether he meant it, Sir Keir insisted that Mr Corbyn would have made a better prime minister than Mr Johnson.Sir Keir Starmer said he believed Jeremy Corbyn would have made a better PM than Boris Johnson (Stefan Rousseau/PA) (PA Wire)The Labour leader has in recent weeks sought to distance himself from Mr Corbyn, while his party is forecast by opinion polls to sweep to victory in the election.He criticised the Conservatives’ election offer as a “Jeremy Corbyn-style manifesto” that would “load everything into the wheelbarrow” without explaining how to pay for it.An audience member asked the Labour leader about his remarks. “You criticised the Tory manifesto as Jeremy Corbyn-like,” they said, adding: “Anything you want can go in it, nothing is costed. Why did you back his original manifesto in 2019?”Sir Keir replied: “In 2019 I campaigned for the Labour Party as I’ve always campaigned for the Labour Party.”He said that afterwards it became clear the electorate “thought it was too much and they wanted to see something which was fully costed and fully funded”.Jeremy Corbyn, who is standing as an independent in Islington North, has accused Sir Keir of ‘double standards’ over his comments (PA Wire)Mr Corbyn has accused his successor of attempting to rewrite history with his recent comments about the 2019 Labour manifesto.The now independent candidate for Islington North said Sir Keir had displayed “double standards” in expressing this opinion now, but not while serving in Mr Corbyn’s shadow cabinet.The BBC Question Time special also featured Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey and Scotland’s first minister John Swinney for the SNP, with prime minister Rishi Sunak up last.Sir Ed, who was first in the line-up, faced difficult questions about his record in the coalition years and as minister in the Horizon scandal.Mr Sunak also faced tough questions and at one point was met with boos and cries of “shame” when he claimed he would take the UK out of the European Court of Human Rights."

In doing so they will only hand Labour an even larger majority (“Tory wipeout”, report, June 20), which will not be good for either the next parliament or our democracy.As a Labour supporter I’m strangely hoping that the shy Tory vote will appear at the last minute, as it has done before, and allow the party to provide some sort of opposition.Christian FroggattReigate, SurreySIR – The mandate for Boris Johnson in 2019 should have resulted in Tory government for many years – yet through arrogance, incompetence and lying, the party has achieved the most spectacular reversal. Absolutely criminal, in anyone’s book.Graham NicholsonRowlands Castle, HampshireSIR – Given the devastating predictions of your survey, it is obvious that Labour is heading for a landslide. The Tory mantra of “Vote Reform, get Labour” therefore has no traction.Conflicted voters are now free to back Reform with a clear conscience.George KellyBuckinghamSIR – A Labour landslide would be preferable to narrow win, as it would allow Sir Keir Starmer to keep his far-Left in check. In the meantime, Thatcherite Conservatives can vote Reform in order to send the Tories a badly needed message.Tony MarshallRudgwick, West SussexSIR – A Labour landslide with no opposition would be a disaster. After all, “power corrupts, while absolute power corrupts absolutely”. We may end up looking back on the past 14 years as the good old days.David CoverdaleLeeds, West YorkshireSIR – Now where did I put that “Don’t blame me – I voted Conservative” car sticker?Sue McNaughtonEastergate, West SussexSIR – Throughout my adult life I have held views that would be considered moderately Right-of-centre. I have always voted Tory, believing in compassionate conservatism. However, at this election there is no party representing my feelings, or those of millions of other people who would class themselves as “soft Right”.Labour is now reminiscent of Tony Blair’s party, but it is still Left-wing. The Liberal Democrats have become a centre-Left party. The Conservatives, through the efforts of people like Suella Braverman, and because of the threat from Reform, have lurched to the Right. This means that a whole swathe of voters like me have effectively been disenfranchised.Michael ThomasUffington, OxfordshireJust Stop Oil vandalsSIR – Having no conscience, Just Stop Oil protesters attacked Stonehenge (report, June 20). A line was crossed when Magna Carta was vandalised earlier this year. The courts must protect our heritage by making the punishment fit the crime.This is not protest. It’s cultural vandalism – and it won’t stop unless we act firmly.Dr Gerald Edwards GlasgowSIR – Cornflour – the substance thrown by Just Stop Oil protesters over Stonehenge – is probably one of the least damaging things for granite.Turning Stonehenge orange scores high on impact and low on damage. Isn’t that what we want from activists?David BurtonDorking, SurreySIR – I assume the Just Stop Oil protesters walked to Stonehenge and used no fossil-fuel-powered transport. Iain MaitlandSherborne, DorsetParking privilegesSIR – Recently I parked in a disabled bay, as my husband has a Blue Badge. On our return, I was informed by an operative that I was parked illegally, and should pay using the RingGo app (Letters, June 20). As I thought that a Blue Badge allowed me to park in a disabled bay or even on double-yellow lines, I questioned this, and was told that no allowances were made by that company for Blue Badge holders. If a Blue Badge allegedly gives us easier access for appointments and so on, then I am at a loss as to the legality of RingGo’s policies.Ann RunacresUllenhall, WarwickshireScotland’s prideSIR – As an Englishman, I am happy to record that Scottish football support has no equal (Sport, June 20). When the fans paraded through Cologne, led by 20 or so pipers, it was an exhilarating sight. We should all wish them well.Herbert ChappellWoking, SurreySIR – I have no interest in football, but am surrounded by it. It never ceases, with the European Championship all summer and the English season from August to June the following year.   At school in the 1950s, I was forced to play football, and spent afternoons shivering as a goalkeeper. My best chum was Oliver Reed, the late actor, and like me he often prayed for rain and match abandonment. If this happened, we would take ourselves off to the cinema in Epsom, where in later life he appeared on screen.Charles JamesBognor Regis, West SussexTaste in booksSIR – In 1976 I caused great hilarity at my town library by returning a book chewed by my spaniel (Letters, June 20). The book was Gundogs: Training and Field Trials by Peter Moxon.The librarian allowed me to keep the book, having paid the 80-pence fine. I have it to this day.Christopher AllenSwettenham, CheshireSIR – I was a librarian for 37 years. One day a reader came with a bag full of paper and card strips that had once been a book. He said he’d put it on a conveyor at the local bakery as the lunch break was ending. The conveyor was turned on, and the book went through the bread slicer set on thick. Richard WallerWigan, LancashireEducation prioritiesSIR – There have been many letters objecting to Labour’s plan to charge VAT on private school fees.I have no objection to parents paying for private education, and realise that, for some of them, an increase in costs will necessitate hard decisions. Overall, however, this issue will affect a small proportion of pupils. Meanwhile, the Government has failed to improve the standard of education for the 93 per cent of pupils in the state system. There is a shortage of teachers, staff are leaving because of dismal working conditions, buildings are in poor repair and promised new schools have not materialised. Surely these problems are of greater concern.Alan LloydLiverpoolSIR – Michael Deacon’s article (Features, June 20) reminded me of Anthony Crosland, the privately educated Labour education secretary from 1965 to 1967, who said: “If it’s the last thing I do, I’m going to destroy every last f------ grammar school.” He almost succeeded, and since then Oxford, Cambridge and other Russell Group universities have had to tweak their admissions criteria to promote “diversity and inclusion”. Labour’s measures levelled down opportunities for the children of relatively less well-off parents. Half a century later, they may have the same effect again.Philip CorpSalisbury, WiltshireSIR – As a young journalist in Edinburgh, my father was reporting on the run-up to the election of 1964.On passing a fruit machine in the Edinburgh Press Club, he lent a few coins to the soon-to-be prime minister Harold Wilson (Letters, June 20), then watched scornfully as Wilson pocketed his paltry winnings without repaying the initial stake. The Labour Party hasn’t changed much since.Christine KennedyGreenock, RenfrewshireFixing the fridgeSIR – I have a better remedy for Celia Walden’s broken fridge drawer (Features, June 18). These are made from brittle plastic that splits easily; superglue offers only a temporary fix. Instead, take some staples, a small kitchen blowtorch and a pair of pliers. Grasp the staple with the pliers and heat it until it glows red, then press it flat over the split and push into the plastic, making a line of staples along the length of the split. The result may not be invisible, but it is effective.Kate BoydellUgborough, DevonA French cinema classic that never gets oldAnouk Aimee and Pierre Barouh on the set of the 1966 film Un homme et une femme - Giancarlo BOTTISIR – I was saddened to read Anouk Aimée’s obituary (June 19). The film Un homme et une femme made a great impact on me in the 1960s.It had a magnificent musical score by Francis Lai, which I still play at home. Incredibly atmospheric.Robin BeynonLondon SW14Incompetent Britain is failing cancer patientsSIR – How apt that, on the day you report (June 19) that Britain is 20 years behind Europe on cancer care, I went to the pharmacy to collect my prescription for Tamoxifen, only to be told it was out of stock because of a national supply shortage. Again.After a breast cancer diagnosis, the “predict” tool is used to show your individual likelihood of surviving five years. To calculate your overall chances of survival, the tool considers risk factors and treatment options. Should it now be updated to factor in the risk of a wholly incompetent government?Sara PricePoole, DorsetSIR – My wife suffered from recurring pain after a repair to a broken hip in December 2020. Her subsequent NHS referral to an orthopaedic surgeon took more than a year. He referred her to the pain clinic, which took another six months. In February, she was put on the waiting list for an X-ray-guided injection. No date has been given. The NHS website says there is a 44-week waiting list. A phone call to the clinic is answered by a recorded message saying that the east and west divisions are being amalgamated to streamline the service. Our GP wrote but received no reply.My wife’s mobility has deteriorated so far that she is now in a wheelchair and needs mobility aids. We’ve had to put in a shower conversion and a stair climber, and get extra carers – the cost of which must far exceed that of an injection.We’ve now resorted to a private appointment next month. David LeechBalcombe, West SussexSIR – My 95-year-old mother-in-law was referred to the day unit at a major hospital in Wales. After preliminary tests she was required to stay overnight for observation. The wait for a bed on a hard plastic chair in reception lasted some 14 hours, until, at 2am, a trolley was found and put in an emergency ward. A bed was never allocated, and other patients also waiting for beds were still in reception at 7am. When challenged about the availability of a bed, a member of the medical staff said that “this was the current state of the health service in Wales”.My message to those living in England is: be careful what you wish for when voting Labour.Trevor GallCarmarthenLetters to the EditorWe accept letters by email and post.

PA Media: UK News,"NHS funding pledged by parties ‘well short’ of what is needed, says think tank",[],"Ella Pickover, PA Health Correspondent",20 June 2024 at 2:11 pm·4-min read,20,June,2024,02:11:00,4,"NHS funding pledged by leading political parties “falls well short” of what is needed to make improvements in the service, a leading think tank has said.The Health Foundation called on politicians to be honest with the public about the scale of the crisis facing the NHS, and the amount of money needed to address issues.It said that an incoming government will face “difficult choices” – to increase taxes to provide more funding, reduce spending in other departments and services, or see the NHS “do less”.New analysis from the think tank concludes there is a potential £38 billion per year shortfall in the funding needed to improve the NHS by the end of the next parliament.Work by the Health Foundation’s REAL Centre suggests that funding in England will need to rise by an average of 3.8% per year in real terms over the next 10 years to meet rising demand and to deliver improvements across the service.This includes a higher level of growth of 4.5% per year in the first five years.Researchers projected what would happen if the health budget grows in line with the assumed growth in public spending factored into the Office for Budget Responsibility’s economic forecasts for the next parliament – real-terms funding increases of 0.8% per year.This level of growth would see the total Department of Health and Social Care budget increase to £197 billion in 2029/30 – leaving the healthcare system in England around £38 billion a year short of what is needed to drive improvements, experts said.A new Health Foundation report says the money is needed to bring “significant changes” to NHS services, and prioritises spending on GP care, mental health and community services.The analysis includes a 10-year timescale to tackle the backlog of routine hospital appointment – which is slower than Labour and the Conservatives have pledged.Anita Charlesworth, director of the Health Foundation’s REAL Centre, said: “The health service is in crisis and all the main political parties have said they want to fix it – yet the funding they have so far promised falls well short of the level needed to make improvements.“Politicians need to be honest with the public about the scale of the challenge the NHS faces and the reality that an NHS fit for the future needs long-term sustainable investment.In a #GeneralElection we often hear promises to employ more nurses.Jim Buchan explains that ‘more’ nurses at a national level also needs to translate into the ‘right’ number of nurses locally to provide safe care and increase productivity.Read more 👇https://t.co/KK2OJnj8xT pic.twitter.com/tdlwHvIilL— The Health Foundation (@HealthFdn) June 19, 2024“Honesty about this has so far been conspicuously lacking from the General Election debate, with both the main parties unwilling to spell out the difficult choices on public spending and taxation that will confront the next government.“The scenario we have set out is not overly ambitious – it is broadly in line with the pledges set out by the main political parties and public expectations, and assumes the NHS can deliver challenging improvements in productivity.”A Conservative Party spokesman said: “Thanks to our clear plan and bold action, we have virtually eliminated the longest NHS waits and overall waiting lists are falling at the fastest rate in over a decade outside the pandemic.“But there is more to do which is why our £3.4 billion Productivity Plan will transform the NHS with new technology and unlock £35 billion of cumulative savings by the end of the decade.“We will continue to increase NHS funding above inflation across the next Parliament to train and recruit 92,000 more nurses and 28,000 doctors through our Long Term Workforce Plan. We will deliver millions more scans, tests and checks as we cut waiting lists and deliver better care for patients.“Only Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives will take the bold action, backed by a clear plan, to build a brighter and healthier future.“Labour would take the country back to square one with at least £2,094 in higher council tax and other tax rises for every working family.”"
Yahoo News UK,What is tactical voting and why are some people against it?UK voters will head to the polls to elect the next prime minister on 4 July.,"['What is tactical voting?', 'How does tactical voting work?', 'The argument against tactical voting', 'How could tactical voting impact the 2024 election?']",Jimmy Nsubuga,Updated 20 June 2024 at 2:37 am·5-min read,20,June,2024,02:37:00,5,"UK voters will head to the polls to elect the next prime minister in two weeks' time on 4 July.Political parties have been busy campaigning following the snap election announcement by Rishi Sunak, who revealed the vote would be held on Thursday 4 July.The Conservatives are currently trailing Labour by a significant margin in the polls, with the latest polling figures showing Labour projected to potentially secure a record number of MPs and the Sunak himself in danger of losing his seat, which would make him the first sitting prime minister to do so.Other high-profile Tory MPs - including Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Liz Truss - are also facing the prospect of being ousted by voters.Some tactical voting campaigners are eager to make this a reality - with the Conservatives (as the sitting party in government) the most likely to be on the sharp end of such initiatives.Indeed, the Best for Britain campaign group says it wants to inflict the “heaviest possible election defeat” on the Conservatives. It believes that its GetVoting.org initiative could help oust several prominent Tories, including Sunak and Hunt.What is tactical voting?Tactical voting is when someone chooses to vote for a candidate who would not be their first choice, or perhaps a candidate they would not even have considered voting for previously.The idea is that by voting for that candidate, you are doing your bit to stop another candidate winning.It tends to apply in constituencies where two candidates are close in numbers, and significantly out in front of their opponents.Some voters employ tactical voting as a strategy to counter the UK's 'First Past The Post' (FPTP) voting system, where a candidate with the most votes wins.This can result in an MP being elected even though the majority of voters supported candidates from a different political spectrum.For example, a Conservative candidate may win in their local constituency if the vote is divided between left-wing candidates from the Labour and Green Party.Voters will head to the [polls on 4 July. (Getty)How does tactical voting work?A scenario where tactical voting could come into play is when a voter’s preferred candidate is likely to come third with no realistic chance of winning.In this case, the voter could vote tactically by choosing to vote for one of the two candidates who will win the seat.John Boken, a 43-year-old secondary school teacher from Oswestry, is one of millions of registered voters who is preparing to cast his vote for a party that is not his top preference.Despite his inclination towards Labour, Boken feels he has to support the Liberal Democrats to prevent the Conservative candidate from securing the seat in his constituency.An example of tactical voting in action would be a traditional Labour voter who voted for Brexit in 2016 opting to vote for the Conservative candidate in their constituency in the hope of getting a Tory majority and avoiding a hung parliament which they may fear would lead to a second EU referendum.On the other hand, a traditional Tory voter who wants the UK to remain in the EU could lend their vote to the Labour or Lib Dem candidates in a bid to avoid a Conservative majority government.Meanwhile, back in 1997, tactical voting group Get Rid of Them (Grot) targeted 90 seats across the country where tactical voting could secure the defeat of the Tory candidate.And in 2017, the then Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron called on traditional Tory and Labour supporters to vote tactically to bring Conservative numbers down.The argument against tactical votingOne problem with this approach, some argue, is that you end up with a situation where a voter is choosing a candidate who's policies they may disagree with.The Electoral Reform Society, a campaign group opposed to the first-past-the-post system, says switching to some form of proportional representation (PR) would remove the need for tactical voting.Such a system would see, for example, a party that receives one-third of the vote expecting to gain one-third of the seats in parliament.They say this would remove much of the impetus for voters to try and hack their way around the current system.In a blog post on the group's website in 2022, Willie Sullivan wrote: ""No voter should have to vote tactically. But tactical voting is an inevitable symptom of our failing first-past-the-post system used for Westminster elections.""As voters are given just one preference and only one candidate can become the MP in each constituency, votes for all the other candidates go to waste. This all-or-nothing system means that voters have to choose between voting with their hearts or working around the system to get the best outcome in their area.""This kind of voter behaviour is ... sadly a symptom of our electoral system anytime votes head to the polls. The 2019 general election was the most recent example of a ‘hold your nose’ election – where millions of voters were forced to vote for the ‘least worst option.""Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

The Guardian,"Whatever the sums involved, the election betting scandal will linger in public’s minds",[],Dan Sabbagh and Jim Waterson,21 June 2024 at 5:59 am·4-min read,21,June,2024,05:59:00,4,"When Rishi Sunak, Britain’s Conservative prime minister, called a snap election in the pouring rain last month, he would have hoped his party would have closed at least some of the 20-point deficit in the opinion polls.Instead, it seems the only members of his party who have profited since are some of his Downing street aides – in a political betting scandal that has swiftly reinforced prevailing anti-Conservative stereotypes in the British public’s imagination.A week ago, the Guardian revealed that Craig Williams, Rishi Sunak’s parliamentary private secretary, an otherwise obscure politician with an intimate knowledge of Downing Street, had placed a £100 bet on his boss calling an early general election in July.The odds were 5-1, hardly enough to be worth risking a reputation over. But even though Williams stood to gain only £500, he thought it worth placing a bet on Sunday 19 May with a rural Welsh bookmaker.Three days later, a rain-soaked Sunak made his surprise announcement, asking the British public on 22 May: “Who do you trust?” Before that Wednesday morning, few had expected an election to be called before the summer.Williams’ bet raised the question of whether word of the prime minister’s plan had spread and he was relying on inside information, and the industry’s regulator, the Gambling Commission, began an inquiry. Betting on an event of which you already know the outcome is illegal in English and Welsh law.However, it was a question the gilet-wearing Williams studiously avoided when the BBC caught up with him on the street the day after. “I’m not expanding, because it is an independent process,” Williams said as the television cameras followed him, although he was willing to admit the bet was “a huge error of judgment”.Political scandals in Britain do not have to involve large sums of money, but they linger in the public imagination if they feel politicians have been acting with impunity. Fifteen years ago, dozens of MPs were forced out after an expenses scandal. One Conservative quit after asking taxpayers to pay £1,645 for an ornamental duck house.More pertinently, Sunak’s predecessor as prime minister but one, Boris Johnson, was forced out of office two years ago over another scandal: the “Partygate” affair.Johnson, aides and advisers, it emerged, had held a string of parties and drinks events in Downing Street during the coronavirus crisis, at times when the British public were forced to remain at home, unable even to visit sick or dying relatives.The Gambling Commission has widened its investigation, looking at last-minute bets on a July election where anybody stood to gain more than the relatively modest sum of £199. Other data already suggested that several gamblers were making last-minute online bets on a surprise July election.A Guardian analysis shows that a sudden flood of bets on a July election was placed on Tuesday 21 May on the Betfair Exchange, before Sunak had even told his own cabinet of senior politicians that the early election was going ahead.Between January and May, an average of £27 a day was gambled on Sunak calling a general election in July, and most people bet just a few pounds on what was seen as an unlikely outcome.Then, the day before Sunak’s announcement, a total £3,285 was gambled on Betfair in dozens of bets. Some punters stuck on hundreds of pounds, suggesting serious confidence and driving the odds down.Although the data came from only one specialist online bookmaker, it immediately suggested the scale of bets across the whole industry may have been more substantial – as the Gambling Commission’s own inquiries appear to be bearing out.On Monday, a police bodyguard, whose job it was to protect Sunak from terror attacks and other physical threats, was arrested after allegedly placing a bet on the timing of the election. Then on Thursday, it emerged that two more Conservatives might be involved.Laura Saunders, the party’s candidate in Bristol North West, was under scrutiny over an election day bet, the BBC revealed. Her husband, Tony Lee, the party’s director of campaigns, was immediately placed on leave of absence, and the Conservatives were forced to admit that “a small number of individuals” were being investigated.Britain’s opposition Labour party, already firm favourites for a landslide victory, barely had to say anything, although one party spokesperson leaned into the idea that the affair reflected a Conservative sense of entitlement.Pat McFadden, the party’s national campaign coordinator, said he did not understand why it was only the police officer that had been suspended: “This looks as if there is one rule for members of the Tory [Conservative] party, and another rule for everybody else.”"
The Guardian,Rishi Sunak floats sanctions on young people for refusing national service,[],Peter Walker Senior political correspondent,21 June 2024 at 5:36 am·4-min read,21,June,2024,05:36:00,4,"Rishi Sunak has indicated that young people might face restrictions on access to finance or driving licences if they refuse to do national service, as he faced a TV quizzing from voters.Asked during a BBC Question Time special what sanctions people could face for declining to take part in the Conservative policy of compulsory national service for all 18-year-olds, the prime minister pointed to “driving licences, or the access to finance, all sorts of other things”.Questioned on whether this could mean denying young people bank cards, he replied: “There’s lot of different models around Europe.”In his half-hour slot on the show, following Keir Starmer, Ed Davey and John Swinney, the Labour, Liberal Democrat and Scottish National party leaders, Sunak was also repeatedly challenged on why the public should trust the Tories after 14 sometimes chaotic years in office.He received shouts of “shame” after refusing to say he would keep Britain in the European convention on human rights.He was also challenged on revelations about alleged betting on the general election date, saying he was “incredibly angry” about the issue. .The prime minister was asked why Brexit was “absent” from the current Conservative manifesto, a question which prompted applause from the audience in York.Pressed on NHS waiting lists, he conceded that the government “haven’t made as much progress as I would like” but insisted things were improving. Asked if this had convinced him, the questioner replied: “No.” Another audience member, a doctor, then attacked Sunak over his NHS plans, saying: “People are suffering.”The sceptical tone was set by the first question to Sunak, which noted the quick succession of five Tory prime ministers, including Liz Truss’s six weeks in office: “I am asking if you would confess to us tonight even just a small amount of embarrassment to be leading the Conservative party?”Sunak insisted people should judge him on his own record, but was then asked why young people should trust him given the “shenanigans with the Tory party”. Fiona Bruce, hosting the show, said: “There’s a bit of a theme emerging.”In his half-hour slot before Sunak’s, Starmer was also asked a series of tricky questions, with one audience member calling out “all of the backtracking on policies from Labour”.Starmer gave a bullish response, saying tough decisions were needed, characterising one as being between reducing NHS waiting lists and removing student tuition fees.“They are political choices,” he said, calling himself “a commonsense politician” and adding: “I’m telling you what they are before the election, so people can make their mind up.”The Labour leader faced a grilling over whether he was being sincere when he praised Jeremy Corbyn during the 2019 election as someone who would make a “great” prime minister.After deflecting the question by saying he did not expect Labour to win in 2019, as he has done before, Starmer said: “I was campaigning for the Labour party, I was a Labour politician.”Pressed by Bruce for a yes or no answer about whether he meant it, Starmer indicated he believed Corbyn would have been better than his Conservative opponent, saying: “Look what we got – Boris Johnson.”Asked about transgender rights and differences within the Labour party over the issue, Starmer stressed that he wanted to bring the public together on divisive issues. He contrasted this with Sunak’s decision to make a “trans joke” in parliament, winning applause.Davey, the first leader to be grilled, faced audience opprobrium over his party’s role in the 2010-15 coalition government, with one audience member winning applause by accusing the Lib Dem leader of having “enabled Cameron’s and Osborne’s austerity”.Another questioner prompted applause by asking how young people could trust the Lib Dems when they had broken a pledge over introducing tuition fees.Davey conceded that he was “not proud” of some of the policies enacted, saying that one lesson he had learned from the coalition period was that in 2010 his party “promised what we couldn’t deliver”.Similarly, Swinney was asked about the succession of recent scandals for his party, with one questioner saying it had “destroyed itself from the top down”. The SNP leader said he realised his party had to “rebuild the trust of people in Scotland”.He was also pressed on whether the SNP would continue to push for independence if it did not achieve a majority of Scottish Westminster seats, a question he somewhat dodged."
The Telegraph,Starmer: Corbyn would have made better prime minister than Johnson,['No figure on migration'],Ben Riley-Smith,21 June 2024 at 5:23 am·5-min read,21,June,2024,05:23:00,5,"Sir Keir Starmer has said that Jeremy Corbyn would have made a better prime minister than Boris Johnson.The Labour leader made the comment in a special BBC Question Time programme in which he was pinned down over his past support for Mr Corbyn.Sir Keir first refused five times to stand by his comment made in the run up to the 2019 election that Mr Corbyn, his predecessor as Labour leader, would have made a “great prime minister”.But he eventually said: “He would be a better prime minister… look what we got, Boris Johnson, a man who made massive promises, didn’t keep them, and then had to leave parliament in disgrace.”The comment is eye-catching since Sir Keir has in recent years repeatedly distanced himself from Mr Corbyn, a Left-winger who has since been forced out of the Labour Party. Mr Corbyn is standing as an independent candidate at this election.During the BBC programme, the Labour leader, who was booed as he entered the studio, claimed that too many homeowners were ‘ripping off’ their tenants. and he said they would be banned by law from accepting the highest offer of rent from potential tenants after “bidding wars”.Sir Keir said that landlords would not be allowed to go back and forth between potential tenants getting final offers, driving up the rent.He said that legislation would be tabled to bring about the change if Labour wins office, meaning that the new rules would be legally enforceable.However, repeatedly pressed by Fiona Bruce, the BBC presenter, about how exactly the plan would work he gave few other details.Sir Keir said: “We have to stop the landlords ripping off tenants who are doing this bidding war: who’ll pay more until people are paying through the roof. We have to end that.“We can pass legislation to say you can’t do it because it’s driving rents through the roof and it’s not fair. It’s taking advantage.”On Thursday night, four political leaders were each grilled for 30 minutes on the BBC programme: Sir Keir, Rishi Sunak, Sir Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, and John Swinney, the SNP leader.The Labour leader was also pinned down on the change in his position on trans issues, and faced criticism over his plans to apply VAT on private school fees.Describing his desire to bring in a law on how landlords can act in the rental market, Sir Keir said: “We can’t have this bidding war like this. We have to have a scheme in place to stop them driving rents up and up. Lots of renters are paying huge deposits and we have to stop that as well.”The Labour leader said that a landlord would not be able to get a final offer on rent from one possible tenant, then go to a second and ask them to bid something higher, and so on.The aim is to stop landlords from bounding tenants off each other in a way that artificially raises rents. But the full details of how the policy would work remains unclear.Sir Keir was challenged on his past support for Mr Corbyn, the Left-wing Labour leader for the 2017 and 2019 election who has been forced out of the party.At one point Bruce asked Sir Keir to answer “yes or no” whether he was telling the truth when saying in the past that in 2019 Mr Corbyn would make a “great prime minister”.Sir Keir did not give a yes-no answer and the audience laughed. He defended his past position by saying: “In 2019 I campaigned for the Labour Party as I’ve always campaigned for the Labour Party. I wanted good colleagues returned to parliament.”Sir Keir also, after repeated pressing, admitted that NHS waiting lists may not return to normal years until five years into a Labour government.The Labour leader at first declined to answer when asked at what time the public could know they would get an NHS appointment in under a month.Sir Keir said “we will start the work on waiting lists on day one in government”, and later “we will get those operations going as quickly as we can with staff”.Asked again for specifics, Sir Keir said the NHS backlogs would be brought down “over the course of the parliament”. A parliament lasts five years, which would mean 2029.The Labour leader was pressed on his about-turns in policy. Sir Keir has been criticised for ditching many of the 10 pledges that he named in the 2020 Labour leadership contest.Sir Keir insisted he was a “commonsense politician”, arguing he had abandoned his plans to nationalise energy firms after concluding it would be too costly and not bring bills down.No figure on migrationOn immigration, a policy area that the Tories have criticised Labour on for not being tough enough, Sir Keir said he wanted net migration to fall but refused to put a figure on it.Sir Keir said: “Migration is at record levels under this Government. They’ve completely lost control. We need to get that number down. We need to get it significantly down“I’m not going to put an arbitrary figure on it because every single politician who as put a number on it has never met that number“We need to get it down.. We want to get it down significantly – it needs to be balanced migration. The problem is we haven’t got the skills in this country.”The Labour leader was also challenged on his past comments about trans issues. Sir Keir once said that 99.9 per cent of women “haven’t got a penis”.But Sir Keir outlined a more absolute stance on the BBC, saying: “On the biology, I agree with what Tony Blair said in relation to men having penises and women having vaginas.“That doesn’t help on the gender. There are some people who don’t identify with the gender that they are born into and they go through a lot of anxiety and distress.“My view in life is to respect and give dignity to everyone.I was worried by the way in which the debate was being conducted: it got very toxic… and we lost sight of people in that.”"
Sky News,"It was the good, the bad and the ugly for Rishi Sunak during the latest TV election showdown",[],Sky News,Updated 21 June 2024 at 11:06 am·4-min read,21,June,2024,11:06:00,4,"From Rishi Sunak, we saw the good, the bad and the ugly during the latest TV election showdown with other party leaders - and a tough and unforgiving audience.The good came when he broke his silence on the Tory betting scandal early on in his half-hour session of questions, declaring he was ""incredibly angry"" and vowing that any law breakers would be ""booted out"" of his party.The bad followed when he struggled to defend his own policy on national service for 18-year-olds and was tetchy with an audience member who asked about Brexit.And the ugly came at the end when the audience angrily shouted ""shame!"" when he launched into Reform UK-style rhetoric about the European Convention on Human Rights and attacked what he called a ""foreign court"".That sort of talk may play well with right-wing MPs and activists, but it bombed here and will have alienated those voters thinking of switching to Labour or the Liberal Democrats.So Mr Sunak started well, got bogged down in detail in the middle and then ended badly, though he eventually did manage to land some blows on Labour on tax - as he has continued to do so throughout the election campaign.The two takeaways from the PM's part of this election programme will be his threat to expel betting wrongdoers and his misjudging the audience on the ECHR.But not surprisingly, that wasn't good enough for opposition MPs.Immediately after the programme, Labour's Jonathan Ashworth told Sky News Mr Sunak still has not taken any action against Tory candidates Craig Williams and Laura Saunders, who are being investigated by the Gambling Commission.He should have suspended them immediately, as Sir Keir Starmer has demanded, Mr Ashworth said.But despite the shouts of ""shame!"" from the audience on the ECHR near the end, Mr Sunak will feel that with the Tories losing votes to Nigel Farage he had to throw the Tory right and would-be Reform UK voters some red meat.Those Tory MPs who love to hate the ECHR will no doubt have approved of Mr Sunak's attack as far as it went - and no doubt accuse the BBC of selecting a ""lefty"" audience.Before Mr Sunak, Sir Keir stumbled once again, as he did in his interview with Beth Rigby in last week's Sky News Battle for No 10 programme in Grimsby, when asked about his support for Jeremy Corbyn.Host Fiona Bruce repeatedly challenged Sir Keir on why he said Mr Corbyn would make a great prime minister in 2019, but the Labour leader kept dodging the question and looked shifty.Eventually, Sir Keir said, rather lamely, that Mr Corbyn would have made a better prime minister than Boris Johnson.Tories will no doubt taunt him on that claim for the rest of the campaign.Sir Keir's other tricky moments came when he was quizzed about his dispute with Labour MP Rosie Duffield on trans issues.""I agree with Tony Blair,"" he said. But he shunned the Canterbury MP and couldn't bring himself to mention her name.That was disrespectful. The Labour leader seems to have a problem with Ms Duffield. It makes him sound intolerant, which his critics would say is fair criticism.The surprise here was a solid performance from the SNP leader John Swinney. He is less confrontational than the party's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn.He has a funereal style of delivery that has previously seen him compared to an undertaker.He could also be compared to a Church of Scotland priest reading from the prayer book, to be fair.But he's an old pro and a details man, as he demonstrated when answering tricky questions about the SNP performance on the NHS in Scotland and was courteous with members of the audience, even when the questions were tough.It all began with Sir Ed Davey, who was immediately greeted with the question: ""Aren't you going to bankrupt the country?""""No,"" he replied.Well, it would have been a shock if he'd said yes.Read more:Labour vows to end rental 'bidding wars'Green co-leader rejects Liz Truss comparisonFormer Tory minister says he'll vote LabourThe second questioner was applauded after he accused Sir Ed of breaking promises in coalition government, citing the Lib Dems' U-turn on tuition fees.He was also ridiculed by a member of the audience over his ""horseplay"" in the campaign, the stunts such as splashing around on Lake Windemere and riding on a rollercoaster at Thorpe Park in Surrey.And inevitably, he was asked if he was proud of his record as Post Office minister during the Horizon scandal.The questions were tough, but he dealt with them calmly. His style was that of a fireside chat.With four party leaders competing this was a game of four quarters.And this tough and unforgiving audience gave the leaders no quarter."
The Independent,Sunak ‘incredibly angry’ over gambling scandal but refuses to suspend candidates involved,[],David Maddox,21 June 2024 at 8:19 am·5-min read,21,June,2024,08:19:00,5,"Rishi Sunak confessed to being “incredibly angry” over members of his inner circle being caught up in a gambling scandal over bets on the date of the election.But, as the prime minister faced a BBC Question Time audience with just two weeks of the election to go, he refused to suspend two candidates currently being investigated by the Gambling Commission.With polls still pointing to a massive Labour majority and a Tory wipeout with many voters defecting to Reform, Mr Sunak needed his half-hour slot in the debate to be a platform to turn things around in the closing stages of the election campaign.Instead he was confronted by the betting scandal which saw his director of campaigning Tony Lee “take a leave of absence”. Meanwhile, Mr Lee’s wife Laura Saunders, a candidate in Bristol who has worked for the party since 2015, and Craig Williams, his parliamentary private secretary, are all being investigated for placing bets just before Mr Sunak called his surprise snap election.Keir Starmer was asked about his previous comments on Jeremy Corbyn (PA)A tired and tense looking Mr Sunak looked exasperated as he was confronted with hostile questions on his own performance during the campaign, the scandal and other issues.At the end of his 30 minutes he managed to attack members of the audience and was booed and catcalled with cries of “shame” over his promise to quit the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) if it prevented him from protecting the UK’s borders on migration.He told the Question Time audience: “It was the right moment to call the election, for the reasons that I have outlined.”Asked if he was glad to have called the election, he added: “I am.”The prime minister, who attacked his predecessors Boris Johnson and Liz Truss several times, compared his current prospects to those he had during the Tory leadership contest of 2022 against Ms Truss.In a defiant note on why he would not give up even with the polls stacked against him, Mr Sunak said: “Even though people didn’t want to hear it at the time, I kept going, I kept saying what I thought was right for this country, I kept going until the end and you know what? I was proved right then.“And that is why you can trust me now when I say that what Keir Stammer is promising you is the same fantasy as Liz Truss did and it is just going to make your taxes go up and that matters to me because I don’t want that to happen.”A tense Sunak answers questions from the audience (PA)Mr Sunak, who was a Leave supporter in 2016, also defended Brexit. Asked if Brexit had denied young people a future, he said “we had a referendum, it’s time to get on”.He said it is time to “make sure we realise all the benefits” of Brexit.Earlier, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer was challenged on the number of U-turns he has made and his integrity as a politician.He was challenged over his previous support for Jeremy Corbyn and claims that he would make a great prime minister, which saw Sir Keir again try distance himself from his recent past.The Labour leader said: “I am a common sense politician. I work through the issues and to me it did not make sense to nationalise energy and not get the bills down, so I decided we would go for getting the bills down.”However, he refused to give a number or time frame for his pledge in bringing migration down.He was also challenged on his treatment of Canterbury Labour candidate Rosie Duffield, who has been marginalised over her belief in protecting female biological rights.Quizzed about his views on the definition of a woman, Sir Keir said he agreed with Sir Tony Blair’s recent comment that a woman has a vagina and a man has a penis.Sir Keir said: “There are many people who don’t identify with the gender they are born into.”The Labour leader said he wanted to “give dignity to everyone” and criticised Mr Sunak for a trans jibe allegedly linked to Brianna Ghey.“I want to bring the country together,” he added, “during the pandemic people were looking out for each other.”The first two up before the audience were Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey and SNP leader John Swinney.Mr Davey faced tough questions about his record in the coalition years and as minister in the Horizon scandal, as grilling of the four main party leaders by members of the public kicked off.Challenged by a student over the Lib Dems abandoning their pledge to scrap tuition fees in the coalition government, Sir Ed said: “I understand why your generation lost faith in us. It was a difficult government to be in.”He said the loss of trust in his party after that period was “very scarring” and admitted he was “not proud” of some of the votes he had to take part in.In the SNP leader’s session Fiona Bruce repeatedly challenged Mr Swinney on what it would mean for his democratic mandate for independence if the SNP failed to win a majority of Scottish seats in July given, she suggested, it would be a “democratic decision that you shouldn’t be pursuing independence”.When he repeated that he wanted people in Scotland to confidently vote for the SNP so the party could turn its manifesto into reality, she voiced her conclusion that he was not going to answer the question.He was also asked why the SNP had backtracked on its opposition to new oil and gas licences, and he said that while the need to transition to net zero was “absolutely inescapable” it would be necessary to use fossil fuels “for some time to come”."
The Independent,"Boris, a Jaguar XJL and a Greggs: on the campaign trail with Jacob Rees-Mogg",[],Alex Ross,20 June 2024 at 4:33 pm·9-min read,20,June,2024,04:33:00,9,"On display inside Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg’s untidy office are three large portraits: Sir Winston Churchill, Boris Johnson and himself.They hang from cream-coloured wallpaper behind a cluttered wooden desk at the centre of the HQ for Sir Jacob’s uphill campaign to win the North East Somerset and Hanham constituency – his fifth straight term in the area.“Boris went up when he became leader... we always had the leader up,” says Sir Jacob, looking up at the pictures. “Then Covid came and we’ve hardly used the office since.”No Liz Truss, then. But what about Rishi Sunak, will he get his place next to Churchill?‘Um... well, we will eventually,” Sir Jacob says, with a wry smile. “We’ll see how much we need it after the election, when he’s returned comfortably as PM. Yes, absolutely.”It’s 17 days to polling day on 4 July and I’m in Keynsham, on the edge of Bristol, following Sir Jacob’s general election campaign.The HQ for Sir Jacob’s campaign is a hive of activity ahead of morning canvassing (The Independent)Hidden down an alleyway between Bargain Booze and a local solicitor’s firm, it’s a struggle at first to find the office (I initially mistake it for the former Keynsham and District Conservative Club, where early-morning drinkers are sipping their first pint) but I get there eventually.Boxes of delivery leaflets cover most of the carpeted floor while the chairs and the steep stairwell are filled with around eight friendly members sipping coffee and chatting before the day’s canvassing.“The national polls... you know, we don’t read those,” says Margaret Brewer, Sir Jacob’s upbeat agent, with the latest poll from Ipsos projecting the worst post-war result for the Tory party.Suddenly, Sir Jacob appears at the doorway wearing a dark grey double-breasted suit with a large blue rosette.We shake hands before he picks an issue up with his agent. The local BBC channel is planning an election debate, and he’s concerned the Green Party candidate has not been invited.A map showing the redrawn constituency is displayed in Jacob Rees-Mogg’s office (The Independent)“It doesn’t seem fair,” he says, showing genuine concern, before heading outside to discuss the plan for the day in private.Sir Jacob was elected MP for North East Somerset 14 years ago. It’s a constituency he’s comically described as circling the city of Bath – where Lib Dem Wera Hobhouse was previously MP – like dough around the jam in a doughnut.But his political rite of passage came in 1997 when he was parachuted into a virtually unwinnable seat for the Tory party in Central Fife. A quick search online reveals pictures of the smartly dressed 27-year-old knocking on working-class doors.“There was no Bentley, sadly,” Sir Jacob laughs, correcting subsequent media coverage as he fondly recalls the campaign. “I’d knock on people’s doors and say, ‘I’m Jacob Rees-Mogg, I’m the Conservative candidate, can I count on you for your support?’“More often than not, people would laugh ... they did think it was very funny that a Tory was asking for their vote.”Fast forward 27 years, and electoral campaigning for Sir Jacob remains “very similar” – although in Longwell Green, where we are heading for canvassing today, the reception is likely to be different.The pretty urban suburb on the edge of east Bristol has a strong Conservative following – five out of the six local councillors are Tories – which Sir Jacob wants to cement ahead of the general election.‘More often than not, people would laugh,’ says Sir Jacob, thinking back to his first election campaign in Central Fife (Getty/Colin McPherson)And unlike on the Central Fife campaign, there’s no family nanny, Veronica Crook, in tow while knocking on doors – although his mother, Lady Gillian Rees-Mogg, does show up in the afternoon to help in the office.It takes eight minutes to drive from Keynsham to Longwell Green, where it doesn’t take long to spot the lanky figure of Sir Jacob talking to a woman in a cul-de-sac, or his smart Jaguar XJL parked nearby.This is a leafy area with a modern housing estate of large semi-detached homes, many with pristine front gardens. With the sun out, many residents are busy mowing lawns and cutting hedges.The area, like the neighbouring wards of Bitton and Hanham, will join the old North Somerset constituency as part of boundary changes at the election.But polling isn’t looking good for Sir Jacob.Labour’s Dan Norris, mayor of the West of England and former MP for the seat, is projected to win comfortably, with 42 per cent of the vote according to Survation’s MRP, followed by Sir Jacob on 27 per cent, Lib Dems on 14 per cent and Reform UK with 12 per cent.Mr Norris’s election leaflet features a “Stop Rees-Mogg” stamp. “Absolutely delighted that he’s advertising me,” says Sir Jacob.Sir Jacob accepts the national polls are “not encouraging reading for the Conservatives”, but he urges caution at “an extrapolation of a national poll into a constituency poll” for the local projections.Voter Geoff Meek shakes Sir Jacob’s hand during canvassing in Longwell Green (The Independent)And on the doorstep in Longwell Green, the early signs are promising.After finishing talking to the woman on her front lawn, Sir Jacob goes to two addresses where people tell the former business secretary he has their vote. At the second address, a resident who is taking a break from fixing his dishwasher shares his main issues: “Immigration and the taxes if Labour get in.”But around the corner, problems arise for Sir Jacob and his team.First, a mother holding her three-month-old baby abruptly says she won’t be voting for Sir Jacob, then, at the next door, a man says he’s considering voting for Reform UK.The theme continues at the next semi-detached home where a family are working on an extension outside.“We have always voted Tory but we’re feeling really disappointed,” says one of them. “People feel they [the Conservative Party] haven’t delivered on the things they promised to do. We are losing our culture because of mass migration.”Sir Jacob accepts their frustration. “We made a mistake,” he says, pointing to an expanded migrant labour force after the Covid pandemic. Legal migration is coming back under control, he says.But it doesn’t end there.One of the family draws parallels between Sir Jacob, Nigel Farage and Reform UK. “Why not be Reform?” he asks.“The party is bigger than the leader – the membership of the party has the view I have,” replies Sir Jacob, who goes on to openly question the quality of candidates standing for Reform.“A vote for them is a vote for Lib Dems or Labour,” he adds.But then he finds more support.Self-employed builder Geoff Meek, 58, stops work on a semi-detached property to shake Sir Jacob’s hand. “Things are going well for us,” he says, pointing to a rise in the national insurance threshold.Couple David and Ann Hockney also warmly welcome Sir Jacob at the doorstep of their home, although Ms Hockney, 71, admits she’s toying with voting for Reform UK. “Immigration,” she says, when I ask why.Down one cul-de-sac, at a large detached home, a woman who shakes Sir Jacob’s hand jokes she won’t wash her hands again.A retired man, Mike Morrison, standing outside his garage also gives the incumbent his backing.The 87-year-old, who has lived in the area for 43 years, tells Sir Jacob the former Tory MP Chris Skidmore, who resigned from his Kingswood seat over Mr Sunak’s oil and gas licence plan in January, used to live around the corner.Mark Bray tells Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg he’s undecided on who to vote for. Asked what the big issues are locally, he points toward a 5G mast near his home (The Independent)“The rotter,” quips Mr Morrison.That’s the next stop; Mr Skidmore’s old address, a detached home with a large driveway. Owner Martyn Chugg says he’ll be voting for Sir Jacob, adding that Reform UK’s manifesto is in “cuckoo land”.The 70-year-old says affordable housing is a big issue of the election, with his son in his thirties still living at the family home.As I watch the canvassers begin to wrap up the morning’s proceedings, plumber Anthony Murphy, 44, tells Sir Jacob he’ll be voting Reform. “Nigel is the only one who talks sense,” he tells me.I ask Sir Jacob how it’s gone.“It seems pretty encouraging,” he says, “but you’ve got to be careful. People are nice and good-mannered, and if someone’s polite to you it doesn’t necessarily mean they will be voting Conservative for you.“It’s very easy to assume a friendly comment, even a selfie, means they are a supporter, but it’s not always true.”Back in the office for lunch, where Sir Jacob has a Greggs ham and cheese sandwich and a box of eclairs, I put to him the possibility of losing his seat.“If you throw your hat in the ring, you must expect that sometimes people will throw the hat back at you,” he says.I then ask if he’s worried it could provide a “Portillo” moment – when former Tory leader contender Michael Portillo was defeated in 1997 – on election night.“If you look at the opinion polls, there can be about 100 Portillo moments,” Sir Jacob adds, with a laugh. “Portillo will have bred and taken over the world if it’s going quite the way the opinion polls indicate, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens.”The interview ends, and I realise I’ve been sipping Sir Jacob’s black coffee.“Oh, don’t worry,” he says, with a smile, as I leave him to finish lunch with his agent and mother ahead of a busy afternoon of canvassing in the battle for his political career."
The Telegraph,"Teenagers who refuse National Service could forfeit driving licence, Sunak suggests",['Election date gambling row'],Nick Gutteridge,21 June 2024 at 5:57 am·34-min read,21,June,2024,05:57:00,34,"Young people who refuse to do national service could forfeit their driving licences and be denied access to student loans, Rishi Sunak has suggested.The Prime Minister said there would need to be “a set of sanctions and incentives” to ensure compliance with a new scheme proposed by the Tories.When asked how he would make youngsters take part, he suggested the UK could adopt punitive measures used by other European nations.The Tories have included plans for a new national service scheme in their manifesto.Under the plans every 18-year-old would have to spend either a year in the military or the equivalent of one weekend a month in a volunteering role.Mr Sunak was pressed on how he would enforce the scheme, which the Conservatives say would be compulsory, during a leaders’ special of Question Time.He said: “You’ll have a set of sanctions and incentives and we will look at the models that are existing around Europe to get the appropriate mix of those.”Asked what that meant, he added: “There’s all sorts of things that people do across Europe, whether that’s looking at driving licences, other access to finance.”It is understood the Prime Minister was referring to schemes which mean people who refuse to do national service can face sanctions related to driving licences or student loans.Ten European states have national service - Austria, Estonia, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.Mr Sunak said that a Royal Commission would be set up to examine the best options on incentives and sanctions and report back to Government.A Tory source said such a commision would look at best practice from other comparable counties and decide on appropriate measures for the UK.He said other countries have sanctions on student finance and driving licences, and that Mr Sunak was not saying those are good for the UK.The Prime Minister was one of four main party leaders taking part in a BBC Question Time programme on Thursday night.Election date gambling rowDuring a grilling from audience members Mr Sunak was also confronted about the row over alleged betting on the election date engulfing his party.It emerged this week that a second Conservative candidate and the party’s campaigns director were being looked into by the Gambling Commission.The watchdog is examining bets allegedly placed by Laura Saunders, the Tory candidate in Bristol North West, and her husband, Tony Lee, who is now on leave of absence from his job at party headquarters.Last week the Prime Minister’s parliamentary private secretary, Tory candidate Craig Williams, apologised for placing a £100 bet that the election would be in July.Mr Sunak said that he was “incredibly angry to learn of these allegations” but refused to say that the two candidates involved should be barred by the party.He said: “All I can say is they are serious investigations. It’s right that they are done thoroughly, confidentially, the integrity of that process should be respected.“But what I can tell you is that if anyone is found to have broken the rules not only should they face the full consequences of the law but I will make sure that they are booted out of the Conservative Party.”Mr Sunak was pressed by one audience member over his plans to reduce record levels of migration, which includes a clampdown on dependents’ visas.He said that migrants made a big contribution to the UK but that “levels of migration that we have seen are too high and they need to come down”.“What we have done is say that people are going to bring family members here, they just need to be able to support them.“I think that’s reasonable because anyone who comes to this country obviously adds to the pressure on public services. That is a very common sense measure.”Mr Sunak was then grilled on whether social care staff who come to Britain from overseas should be paid more so they were able to support their families.He replied: “We have a dedicated visa for social care because we know how important it is and we need to make sure that we do get the right workers.”Mr Sunak’s appearance came at the end of a bruising week for the Tories with several polls predicting that the party was on course for an electoral wipeout.A Savanta MRP poll for The Telegraph found the party would be down to little more than 50 seats, with more than 20 Cabinet ministers losing their seats.In that scenario even Mr Sunak would be kicked out of office, becoming the first ever sitting prime minister to lose their seat in an election.Mr Sunak told the BBC Question Time audience he believed he had chosen the right moment to call the General Election.“It was the right moment to call the election, for the reasons that I have outlined.”Asked if he was glad to have called the election, he added: “I am.”10:50 PM BSTThat’s all for this evening...Thank you for following The Telegraph’s liveblog coverage of the BBC Question Time election special.My colleague Jack Maidment will be back tomorrow morning to bring you the latest.10:46 PM BSTSir David Davis: I am angry about allegations of election date bettingSir David Davis said he was “angry” about allegations that Tory figures placed bets on the date of the general election.“Like the Prime Minister, I’m angry about it. I mean, look, it’s in the middle of a criminal investigation. So the Prime Minister is quite right not to step into it.“I’m disappointed and if it’s true it’ll be a disgrace. But we’ve got to wait.”The former Brexit secretary added he was not worried about the threat of Reform in the polls, saying the polls have been wrong at “every single” election he has taken part in.10:33 PM BSTPM was at ‘the top of his game’ says ministerThe Prime Minister was at “the top of his game” during the BBC Question Time leaders’ special, a minister has said.Bim Afolami, the economic secretary to the Treasury, told Sky News: “I don’t think it was the difficult night. I think the Prime Minister performed incredibly well.“I think that yes, you’re right that the news of the day was difficult, but look at the performance the Prime Minister turned out.“It was strong, resolute, decisive, clear. At times he was willing to do that thing that people like you will say politicians don’t do which is challenge the audience, say where he disagreed.“And actually, what I heard at the end was an audience that saw a guy, a Prime Minister, at the top of his game, serious and understanding the challenges the country faces.”10:33 PM BSTStarmer ‘will say just what he thinks you want to hear’ say ToriesSir Keir Starmer “will say just what he thinks you want to hear”, the Tories have said.A spokesman for the Conservative Party said: “It was clear from the debate tonight that Keir Starmer will say just what he thinks you want to hear.“What he didn’t say is that his tax trap manifesto does not add up and he is planning to raise tax. Raise council tax, impose the Retirement tax and tax the family home, this will cost hard working families at least £2,094.“A vote for anyone other than the Conservatives will hand Starmer a super majority to raise your taxes and rig our elections for a generation.”10:29 PM BSTTory minister sets out election dividing linesKevin Hollinrake, a business minister, said the key dividing lines between Labour and the Conservatives were tax and migration.Mr Hollinrake told reporters: “People can choose between lower taxes and lower migration under a Conservative government or higher taxes and higher migration under Labour.”“He’s been very clear these are very difficult decisions to potentially exclude ourselves from parts of the ECHR, and not let the European Court in Strasbourg stop us doing what we need to in terms of controlling legal migration.“We should be clear that we are going to tackle this issue, whatever the resistance in parliament and whatever resistance in other parts of our society, because it’s the right thing to do.”10:26 PM BST‘Cynicism is a big challenge’ for Labour, says Streeting“Cynicism is a big challenge” for Labour despite projections of a landslide election victory, Wes Streeting has said.The shadow health secretary said the scandal over bets placed on the date of the general election was an example of the “Conservative clown show continuing”.He told reporters: “So many lifelong Conservative voters that I’ve been speaking to over the last four weeks are now looking to Labour as the alternative and our challenge in the next fortnight is to persuade people that politics can make a difference, that voting can change things.“We’re not inhaling the polls. We know that. You know, cynicism is a big challenge and the Conservative Party’s message to Labour supporters is put your feet up, stay at home. There’s no need to vote for change because Labour’s going to be in government anyway. We know that.“You know, elections are hard and there are still millions upon millions of votes to be cast in this election. Anything can happen. So we’re working hard for every single vote up to 10pm on July 4.”Sir Keir Starmer speaking during a BBC Question Time Leaders' Special in York - Stefan Rousseau/PA10:19 PM BSTWatch: Audience shouts ‘shame on you’ at Sunak10:18 PM BSTSunak: ‘It was the right moment to call the election’Rishi Sunak said he believed he had chosen the right moment to call the General Election.He told the BBC Question Time audience: “It was the right moment to call the election, for the reasons that I have outlined.”Asked if he was glad to have called the election, he added: “I am.”The Prime Minister compared his current prospects to those he had during the Tory leadership contest of 2022.Mr Sunak said: “Even though people didn’t want to hear it at the time, I kept going, I kept saying what I thought was right for this country, I kept going until the end and you know what? I was proved right then.“And that is why you can trust me now when I say that what Keir Starmer is promising you is the same fantasy as Liz Truss did and it is just going to make your taxes go up and that matters to me because I don’t want that to happen.”10:15 PM BSTLib Dems: Sunak has gone from ‘ducking D-Day to blundering on betting’Rishi Sunak has gone from “ducking D-Day to blundering on betting”, the Liberal Democrats have said.Munira Wilson, the Lib Dem education spokesman, said: “Rishi Sunak has gone from ducking D-Day to blundering on betting. If he was truly angry about this scandal these Conservative candidates would have been suspended.“He is more interested in taking away young people’s bank accounts if they don’t do National Service than investing in their education.She added: “From a flatlining economy to an NHS on its knees, his performance showed why we cannot let Rishi Sunak and the Conservative Party gamble with our country’s future again.”10:11 PM BSTRishi Sunak’s performance was ‘abject failure’ say LabourRishi Sunak faces questions on the general election betting scandal from Labour in the aftermath to the Question Time special.Pat McFadden, Labour’s campaign coordinator, described the Prime Minister’s performance as an “abject failure”.He added: “On the candidates involved in the insider betting scandal, does he think they would be good MPs? Will he campaign for them? Does he want his cabinet colleagues to campaign for them? Does he think they are fit to hold office as Ministers? How many more Tory politicians or officials are involved in this?“When he became leader after the Liz Truss disaster he had a chance to change his party. He flunked it. He put his party before his country. And the consequences of that failure were on full show tonight.”10:08 PM BSTSunak attacks Starmer over CorbynKeir Starmer says he never backed Jeremy Corbyn.

You can vote in our poll below:10:06 PM BSTAudience members shout ‘shame on you’ as Sunak suggests he could leave ECHRRishi Sunak faced calls of “shame on you” as he suggested that he would be prepared to leave the European Court of Human Rights to make his Rwanda plan work.He told a voter in the audience: “Sir, with the greatest respect, we do not need a foreign court to tell us how to police our own borders and our security, right?”He added: “And I believe everything we’re doing is in compliance with our international obligations but if I’m put in a position where I’m forced to choose between those things, I’m going to put our country’s national security first every single time. And I make absolutely no apology about that.”Several in the crowd then shouted: “Shame, shame, shame on you.”Boos and jeers could also be heard during the programme’s closing credits, obscured by Question Time’s theme tune.09:57 PM BSTReaders’ views on Rishi Sunak’s performance09:56 PM BST‘Of course’ I have regrets, says SunakRishi Sunak has been asked if he has any regrets, as Labour is so far ahead in the polls.The Prime Minister told Question Time: “Of course, no one gets everything right, and I’ve been very open about that, and I completely understand people’s frustrations with me, with the Conservative Party, but what this election is about is about the future.”He added: “As I said, I wish we’d made more progress on the waiting list. I’ve been very open about that. I wish we had made more progress on the waiting list because to me, we haven’t made as much progress as I would have liked.”Rishi Sunak on Question Time09:54 PM BSTOther countries are agreeing with our approach to illegal migration, says SunakSir Keir Starmer would lead to the UK becoming the “soft touch of Europe” on illegal migration at a time when “multiple other European countries are agreeing that our approach is the right approach”, Rishi Sunak has claimed.Defending his Rwanda plan, Mr Sunak said: “If Keir Starmer is your Prime Minister, the illegal migrants that we’ve detained will be out on the streets.“They won’t be on those planes. We will become the soft touch of Europe, just at a time when multiple other European countries are agreeing that our approach is the right approach, and that’s what I want to deliver for you as your Prime Minister, if you give me the chance.”09:47 PM BSTNHS is doing more than its done in its history, Sunak insistsRishi Sunak has been grilled over the growing NHS waiting lists, insisting that the health service was carrying out more checks and tests “than it has done in its history”.He told Question Time: “The NHS is today, carrying out more checks, tests, scans, operations, treatments, appointments, than it’s done in its history. But when you’re dealing with six million missed referrals that we are now catching up on it is going to take time to get them down.”Answering a question from an NHS worker, he said: “I absolutely acknowledge your concerns. You and your colleagues are working very hard.“You’re doing more than we’ve ever done before, but the situation is challenging, because we are dealing with the backlog of missed appointments that you are very well aware of, and I’m sure you were working hard during Covid. You saw what didn’t happen during that period.”09:40 PM BSTAnyone who has broken law over general election bets will be ‘booted out’ of Tory Party, says SunakIf anyone has broken the law over betting on the general election they should face “the full force of the law”, Rishi Sunak has said.Tony Lee, the Conservative Party’s director of campaigning has taken a “leave of absence” while he is investigated over an alleged bet on the election date.It had earlier emerged that his wife, Laura Saunders, the Tory candidate in Bristol North West, was facing an inquiry by the Gambling Commission.Craig Williams, Mr Sunak’s parliamentary private secretary, is also facing questions from the gambling watchdog after admitting he “had a flutter” on the date.Responding to the allegations, Mr Sunak said: “I was incredibly angry, incredibly angry to learn of these allegations. It’s a really serious matter. It’s right that they’re being investigated properly by the relevant law enforcement authorities, including, as Fiona said, a criminal investigation by the police.“I want to be crystal clear that if anyone has broken the rules, they should face the full force of the law, and that’s what those investigations are there to do, and I hope that they do their work as quickly and as thoroughly as possible.”He added: “What I can tell you is if anyone is found to have broken the rules, not only should they face the full consequences of the law, I will make sure that they are booted out of the Conservative Party.”09:39 PM BSTSunak fails to say what sanctions would be in place for those who refused national serviceRishi Sunak has failed to say what kind of sanctions would be in place for young people who refused to do national service.Asked how it would be made compulsory, the Prime Minister said: “You’ll have a set of sanctions, and incentives, and we will look at the models that are existing around Europe for the appropriate mix of those.”Asked for examples, Mr Sunak said: “There’s all sorts of things across Europe, whether that’s looking at driving licenses, other access to finance, all sorts of other things.”Pressed on what that meant, the Prime Minister said: “There’s a range of things, and we will have a Royal Commission look at all of those, come back to the government and recommend what the appropriate mix of incentives and sanctions is.”09:32 PM BSTSunak asked whether he feels any ‘embarrassment’ over leading ToriesRishi Sunak immediately came under fire after the first question put to him was whether he felt any “embarrassment” over leading the Conservatives after seven prime ministers.He told Question Time: “When I first got this job, I stood on the steps of Downing Street and spoke to all of you as prime minister for the first time, and I acknowledge that.“I said very clearly that mistakes had been made, and that’s why I was standing there in front of you. In fact, you may remember I spent the summer before that arguing against the policies that my predecessor had suggested were right.“I didn’t think they were right for the country, and I said so. But what I’d ask you to do is judge me on my 18 months that I’ve been in office. I came in with one primary job, and that was to bring back economic stability after the difficult few years that we’ve had.”09:29 PM BSTStarmer: I am a common sense politicianSir Keir Starmer claimed he was a “common sense politician” when asked why he had not kept a promise to abolish university tuition fees.Asked why he had backtracked on the pledge, the Labour leader told the Question Time audience: “We don’t have the money to do everything we want to do. We do want to change the tuition fees.“But I have a choice to make, which was of the available money do I use it for getting rid of the tuition fees… or do I use that money to get our waiting lists down? That is a political decision and I took it.“I am not going to do the tuition fees abolition, because I want to put that money to get our NHS back on its feet.”Sir Keir also said he chose Labour’s plan for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies over nationalising energy companies, as the latter would require huge amounts of money to “pay off the shareholders”.The Labour leader said: “I am a common sense politician. I work through the issues and to me it did not make sense to nationalise energy and not get the bills down, so I decided we would go for getting the bills down.”09:29 PM BSTStarmer defends private schools VAT policySir Keir Starmer has defended his VAT policy on private schools, saying that “all parents are aspirational for their children”.He told Question Time: “Look on private schools, I completely understand that families up and down the country work hard and save hard to send their children to private school because they’re aspirational for their children, but all parents are aspirational for their children.”“Every single parent, every single child, wherever they come from, whatever their background and whichever school they go to, (should) have the same opportunities.”09:25 PM BSTReaders’ views on how Sir Keir Starmer is doing on Question Time09:23 PM BSTStarmer challenged on his views on genderSir Keir Starmer has been challenged on his views over trans issues.Asked about his historic views on gender, the Labour leader said: “Look on the biology. I agree what Tony Blair said the other day, in relation to men having penises and women having vaginas.”He added: “There are some people who don’t identify with the gender that they’re born into, and they go through a lot of anxiety and distress. And my view in life is to respect and give dignity to everyone, whatever their position and I will always do that.”Sir Keir said: “I was worried at the time... by the way in which the debate was being conducted, because it got very toxic, very divided, very hard line, and we lost sight of people in that, so much so that that drags you to a place where we end up, as we did,  with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom making a trans joke in Parliament when the mother of a murder trans teenager was watching out, that is a shocking place to get to.”09:15 PM BSTWatch: Sir Ed Davey refuses to rule out entering coalition09:12 PM BSTOur plans to get NHS waiting lists down is ‘an ask of staff’ says StarmerOur policy plan to cut the waiting lists is “an ask of staff” in the NHS, Sir Keir Starmer has said.Asked by a nurse on Question Time how he’d tackle the crisis in the NHS, he said: “The first thing I’d say is we would treat you with respect.And I say that because we have a Prime Minister who, 18 months or so ago said, ‘I’m going to get the waiting list down’, and he said, ‘hold me personally responsible’.And now he hasn’t gotten down because they’ve gone up… he blames you, he blames the NHS staff, we will never do that, because I know how hard you work, all of the time, in Covid in particular.He added: “We do have to take the pressure off the waiting list. Now that is an ask of staff. It is an ask of staff, I’m not going to say otherwise, because it will be working evenings and weekends to get those lists down.”You can read more about the Labour manifesto here09:05 PM BSTStarmer refuses to say whether or not he believed Corbyn would have made a good PMSir Keir Starmer has refused to say whether or not he believed Jeremy Corbyn would have been a good prime minister.Asked several times about whether he meant it when he said that Mr Corbyn would make a “great” prime minister while serving in his shadow Cabinet, Sir Keir said: “It wasn’t a question that really arose because I didn’t think we were going to win the election.”Asked again, he said: “I was campaigning for the Labor Party, and I’m glad I did.”He told Question Time: “In 2019 I campaigned for the Labor Party, as I’ve always campaigned for the Labour Party. I wanted good colleagues to be returned to Parliament. I knew we had a job and a half to do as a Labour Party because I didn’t think we were going to win that election.“Afterwards, because we got the worst results since 1935, the electorate clearly gave their verdict, we did a lot of work on how we needed to change the party.”09:01 PM BSTStarmer booed as he came onto Question Time stageSir Keir Starmer was booed as he came on stage at the BBC Question Time leader’s special.The jeers were heard immediately after host Fiona Bruce announced his name.They were briefly drowned out by the programme’s theme tune before being heard again as he stepped up to the lectern in front of the crowd.The majority of those in attendance applauded the Labour leader.08:59 PM BSTSwinney: Tories ‘can’t be out of office quick enough’John Swinney has said that it is a “racing certainty” that Labour will win the election in England, and called the Conservative Government a “total disaster and a calamity”.Asked whether Sir Keir Starmer or Rishi Sunak would be a better leader in Westminster for Scotland, Mr Swinney said: “Look, I think that the Conservative Government has been a total disaster and a calamity, so it can’t be out of office quick enough.He added: “I think it’s an absolute racing certainty that the Labour Party will win the election in England, and I hope people in Scotland will recognise the importance of having strong SNP voices in the House of Commons, who will argue for decisions to remain in Scotland for Scotland, and not put into people in Scotland first.”08:55 PM BSTSunak’s authorisation of new oil and gas licences is ‘utterly irresponsible’Rishi Sunak’s decision to authorise new oil and gas licences in the North Sea is “utterly irresponsible” and is “essentially to deny the climate emergency”, John Swinney has said.He told Question Time: “The Prime Minister has said that he would authorise 100 new oil and gas licenses. I think that’s completely and utterly irresponsible. It is essentially to deny the climate emergency, and I would have nothing to do with that.“But what I do want to make sure is that we can work with the oil and gas sector to support it in making the transition to net zero, because we will actually need lots of the skills in the oil and gas sector to be available to help us with the transition to net zero.”08:52 PM BSTBrexit means Scotland deserves a second referendum, says SwinneyBrexit caused a “very material change in circumstances that merits another referendum” on an independent Scotland, John Swinney has said.Asked whether Scotland should be able to have a referendum on rejoining the EU or the Single Market, he said: “I think it’s a very good point, because in 2016 Scotland voted emphatically to stay in the European Union.“And one of the things we were told in the 2014 independence referendum in Scotland was that our European Union membership was guaranteed by voting no to independence.He added: “Two years later, the absolute opposite of what was promised actually came to pass. So, for me, that’s a very, very material change in circumstances that merits another referendum on the question of independence, because one of the fundamental building blocks of the arguments against independence was about the continuity of EU membership.”08:46 PM BSTSwinney defends SNP recordJohn Swinney has defended the record of the SNP, after one voter asks if the party can still be trusted “after it appears the party has destroyed itself from the top down”.The SNP leader said: “Let me perhaps set out some of the things that we’ve done since we came to office.“For example, GDP per capita in Scotland, the growth of the economy has been faster in Scotland than the rest of the United Kingdom. Productivity in the Scottish economy has grown faster under the SNP government than it has in the rest of the United Kingdom.”08:43 PM BSTLib Dem team pleased with Sir Ed Davey’s performanceSave for plenty of laughter at Fiona Bruce’s joke about when he met his wife, the spin room was fairly muted as Sir Ed Davey took questions, Dominic Penna reports from York.The Liberal Democrat team here is pleased with the performance of his leader, who faced tough questioning on the Post Office Horizon scandal, tuition fees and his offer to the country.After what they admit was a deliberately silly start to the campaign, with Sir Ed grabbing headlines for a series of stunts across the country, it has taken on a more serious and sober tone since the manifesto launch.The applause enjoyed by Sir Ed when he railed against water giants over the sewage scandal suggests this quietly resolute focus on Britain’s polluted waters, as well as the social care and NHS crises, is starting to pay off.But how that plays out at the ballot box on July 4 remains anyone’s guess.08:41 PM BSTSwinney: The UK Government should let us put the question of independence to ScotlandJohn Swinney has blamed the UK Government for not allowing the SNP to put “the concept” of independence to the public.He told voters: “I honestly believe that Scotland would be a stronger country and would have better prospects if we were an independent country.“That’s been my view, my honest view, for all of my entire adult life. but I’m a democrat, so I accept that we can’t be an independent country until the people of Scotland vote for us to be an independent country. And I do believe in the right of the people of Scotland to decide their own future.”John Swinney at Question Time election specialHe added: “One of the frustrations I’ve got is that today in the Scottish Parliament, there is a majority in favour of there being a referendum on independence and that Scotland should be an independent country.“But we are not being permitted by the United Kingdom Government to put that idea and that concept to the public, and I think we should have the right to do so.”08:39 PM BSTSwinney: I may have played a part in polarisation of politicsJohn Swinney, leader of the SNP, has now taken to the stage to take questions from voters.He has said that he believes that there is a need to “bring people together” in politics, and he is “worried” about the polarisation of politics.Mr Swinney said: “One of the things that really worries me about politics today, and accept that I might actually have played a part in creating this, is the polarisation of debate.“I think there’s a need to bring people together and when I became First Minister just six and a half weeks ago, I pledged that I would reach out beyond my party to other parties, to other opinions, to try to bring people together, because I think what’s wrong with our society today, is that we’re not together.“We are polarised, and we have to bring people back together.”08:31 PM BSTWhy did you think of Sir Ed Davey’s performance?08:31 PM BSTDavey: I understand why young people lost faith in the Lib DemsSir Ed Davey said he understands why people no longer trust the Liberal Democrats after they abandoned their pledge to scrap tuition fees in the coalition years, but said his party has learned lessons.During the BBC’s Question Time special, the Liberal Democrat leader said: “I understand why your generation lost faith in us. It was a difficult government to be in.”He added: “The thing I learned from that process – the whole process, fees, but other things too – was you shouldn’t promise what you can’t deliver, and I think we did in 2010.”Asked if he’s making promises he can’t commit to in the current election campaign, Sir Ed replied: “Absolutely not. It was the big lesson I learned.”He later added that the coalition years were “very scarring”.08:30 PM BSTTories release attack ad: ‘The Lib Dems aren’t a joke’The Lib Dems aren't a joke.If you vote Lib Dem, you'll end up with Labour. #BBCQT pic.twitter.com/dqwm1gGHAj— Conservatives (@Conservatives) June 20, 202408:24 PM BSTTelegraph readers’ views on Sir Ed Davey’s performance08:23 PM BSTDavey questioned on whether Lib Dems appeal to voters in the North of EnglandThe Liberal Democrat leader has been challenged on whether or not they appeal to voters in the North of England.Sir Ed Davey told a voter from the North of England: “Well, I’m hoping that you like our manifesto and the things I’m saying tonight, there are seats in Greater Manchester that I’m really sure we can win, Hazel Grove and Cheadle in Stockport, part of Greater Manchester.“We’re looking really good to beat the Conservatives in those seats. And there are parts of the North, (I was) in Sheffield earlier today with our candidate in Sheffield Hallam, I think we can actually beat Labour there. I’m going to Harrogate tomorrow.“So there are parts of the North, but it is true that the vast majority of seats that I think we can win at this election are in the Home Counties.”08:15 PM BSTDavey questioned on whether he thinks he can become PMSir Ed Davey has been questioned on whether or not he believes he can become prime minister.Asked whether he believed he could, he said: “I’m realistic about our chances. Right, we’ve had three very bad elections… and when I became leader, I said my top priority was to defeat as many Conservative MPs as possible.”Asked again by Fiona Bruce, Sir Ed said becoming prime minister would be “challenging given the polls.”“But I don’t want to put a ceiling on our ambition”, he added.Liberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey speaking during a BBC Question Time Leaders' Special in York - Stefan Rousseau/PA08:09 PM BSTDavey defends time in coalition with the ToriesSir Ed Davey has defended his time serving in coalition with the Conservatives.Questioned about the Liberal Democrats’ credibility after serving in coalition with the Tories, Sir Ed said: “It was very difficult governing with the Conservatives, we couldn’t get everything we wanted.“You either had to stay in and fight inside the government or leave. I think the easy choice for me would be to leave, vote against it, and tour the media studios and complain. The hard choice was to stay in, roll my sleeves and really fight.”He added that he was “not proud of some of our votes” when the Liberal Democrats were in coalition.08:05 PM BSTSir Ed Davey denies he will ‘bankrupt’ the countrySir Ed Davey has been challenged on his spending plans, with the first question put to the Liberal Democrat leader asking if he was going to “bankrupt” the country.Sir Ed told Question Time: “The answer is no. We put forward a very detailed, costed manifesto, and it’s got a big health and social care package at the centre of about £9 billion and other things, for example, helping with free school meals, with cost of living, and we’ve shown how we’ll pay for everything we’ve got in that.”08:01 PM BSTSpin room hots up as Question Time beginsThe spin room here in York is already a hive of activity with journalists and broadcasters gearing up for the night ahead, writes Dominic Penna.Snacks and sandwiches have been laid on for those in attendance as party aides and MPs begin to work the room.Bim Afolami, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, and Sir David Davis, a former Brexit secretary, are among the star guests wheeled out by the Tories. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, is expected to be spinning for Labour.Many believe this election is already a foregone conclusion. The prominence of the event tonight represents one of the last chances to shift the dial for Rishi Sunak, while Sir Keir Starmer will want to be careful to avoid any unforced errors that could jeopardise his 20-point poll lead.07:46 PM BSTSunak to lose seat in Tory wipeout, major poll predictsThe BBC special comes a day after the Telegraph revealed that Rishi Sunak is predicted to become the first sitting prime minister ever to lose their seat at a general election.The Conservatives are also on track to slump to just 53 seats, with around three-quarters of the Cabinet voted out, a major opinion poll for The Telegraph has revealed.The Liberal Democrats are on course to be just behind the Tories on 50 MPs, according to the Savanta and Electoral Calculus polling analysis, leaving them in touching distance of becoming the official opposition.Labour is forecast to have 516 seats and an estimated House of Commons majority of 382 – double that won by Sir Tony Blair in 1997 – as Sir Keir Starmer becomes prime minister.07:21 PM BSTPictured: Ed Davey and John Swinney arriveRishi Sunak arriving at the BBC Question Time Leaders' Special at York UniversitySir Ed Davey arriving at the BBC Question Time Leaders' Special in York - PAScottish First Minister and SNP leader John Swinney - Getty Images07:16 PM BSTWhat could the leaders be grilled on?The party leaders are likely to face questions on the economy, the NHS, and immigration, among other topics.Rishi Sunak may also have to face a grilling over two Conservative Party candidates under investigation for betting on the date of the general election by the Gambling Commission.Sir Keir Starmer has previously come under fire during previous televised debates for his support for Jeremy Corbyn in 2017 and 2019, so he may face questions about that.07:14 PM BSTWhat is the format?Each of the four leaders will face 30 minutes of questions from the Question Time audience, appearing individually one after another.Sir Ed Davey will go first for the Liberal Democrats, then John Swinney for the SNP, then Sir Keir Starmer for Labour and finally Rishi Sunak for the Tories.07:12 PM BSTWho is appearing on Question Time tonight?Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer will face questions from the audience, as well as John Swinney for the Scottish National Party and Sir Ed Davey for the Liberal Democrats.Nigel Farage and Adrian Ramsey will be appearing on another Question Time special next week for Reform UK and the Green Party.07:07 PM BSTHello and welcome to our live coverageWe’re bringing you the latest updates this evening as Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer face off in a BBC Question Time election special.Genevieve Holl-Allen, political reporter, will be bringing you the latest news and analysis as the evening unfolds.The BBC election special begins at 8pm."

It is a really serious matter.""""I want to be crystal clear that if anyone has broken the rules, they should face the full force of the law.""Quizzed over why the candidates have not been suspended while the investigations take place, Mr Sunak said the ""integrity of that process should be respected"".He added: ""What I can tell you is if anyone is found to have broken the rules, not only should they face the full consequences of the law, I will make sure that they are booted out of the Conservative Party.""Calls to suspend Tory candidatesLabour Party campaign sources told Sky News they noticed the odds on a July election narrow the day before Mr Sunak announced it on 22 May.Earlier, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for Ms Saunders to be suspended and said it is ""very telling"" Mr Sunak has not already done so.""If it was one of my candidates, they'd be gone and their feet would not have touched the floor,"" Sir Keir added.Mr Sunak faced many questions about trust during the BBC grilling, with the first audience member asking if he would ""confess to [a] small amount of embarrassment"" after having five Tory prime ministers in the last seven years and the UK becoming something of an ""international laughingstock"".The Tory leader said that ""very clearly mistakes had been made"" and asked the public to judge him on the last 18 months in office.He faced shouts of ""shame"" when he launched an attack on the ""foreign court"" - the European Court of Human Rights - and also insisted he was glad he called the election when he did despite his standing in the polls plummeting further since then.Having named the date of the election amid a 20-point deficit, the prime minister has failed to make up ground in a campaign dominated by political gaffes - notably his early exit from a D-day event.The gambling scandal was the latest blow, after multiple projections of a historic Labour landslide and a number of big figures - from a former Tory donor to a former Tory minister - announcing they would back Sir Keir for the first time ever when polling day comes around.Responding to Mr Sunak's BBC performance, Lib Dem Education Spokesperson Munira Wilson said the prime minister ""has gone from ducking D-Day to blundering on betting"".""If he was truly angry about this scandal these Conservative candidates would have been suspended,"" she said.Pat McFadden, Labour's National Campaign Coordinator, said Mr Sunak's ""performance tonight was an abject failure"".The Tories hit back: ""It was clear from the debate tonight that Keir Starmer will say just what he thinks you want to hear.""Mr Sunak will step up warnings about handing Labour ""a blank cheque"" at the election later today.Read more:Has Sunak blundered by opting for long, six-week election campaign?Tory voters say gambling scandal won't make a differenceStarmer grilled on U-turnsMr Sunak faced questions after Sir Keir took to the stage for a grilling that mainly centred around his previous support for Jeremy Corbyn and multiple policy U-turns.The Labour leader ducked a volley of questions over whether he truly believed his predecessor would make a ""great"" prime minister, but said he would have been better than Boris Johnson - who went on to win in 2019.On his U-turns, such as rowing back on a promise to abolish university tuition fees and nationalise energy, Sir Keir said he was a ""common sense politician"" and those pledges were no longer financially viable after the damage the Tories had done to the economy.Mr Starmer will be in Scotland today to pledge that Labour's industrial strategy would deliver nearly 70,000 jobs.Davey confronted over-coalition years The event also heard from Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, who faced difficult questions about his record in the coalition years and as postal affairs minister during the Horizon scandal.Challenged by a student over his party abandoning their pledge to scrap tuition fees in the coalition era, he said: ""I understand why your generation lost faith in us. It was a difficult government to be in.""On his time as postal affairs minister between 2010 and 2012, and whether he was proud of that role, he said he made ""two big mistakes"", including failing to initially meet campaigner Alan Bates and not seeing through assurances given to him by the Post Office that there was nothing wrong with the faulty IT system that led to hundreds of wrongful convictions.On the campaign trail today, the Lib Dem leader will call for urgent reform to end the ""appalling situation"" in NHS dentistry.Meanwhile, SNP leader John Swinney, when asked whether he was going to carry on with calling for independence ""until you get the answer you want"", stressed his belief that Scotland would be better as an independent country.""I want Scotland to be like Denmark, or Ireland, or Sweden as an independent country. And when you look at those countries, they are more prosperous, they are more equal, they are fairer than Scotland and the United Kingdom,"" he said.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage - who had complained about being excluded from the leaders' panel - will feature in a separate Question Time next week. He is expected to campaign in Clacton today."
