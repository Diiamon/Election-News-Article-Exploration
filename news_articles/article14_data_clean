The Guardian,Farage said Andrew Tate was ‘important voice’ for men in podcast interview,['Farage’s interview comments'],Rowena Mason and Ben Quinn,20 June 2024 at 5:00 pm·8-min read,20,June,2024,05:00:00,8,"Nigel Farage has praised the misogynist influencer Andrew Tate for being an “important voice” for the “emasculated” and giving boys “perhaps a bit of confidence at school” in online interviews that appear to be aimed at young men over the past year.The Reform UK leader spoke in favour of Tate for defending “male culture” in a Strike It Big podcast that aired in February, while acknowledging that the influencer had gone “over the top” and elsewhere that he had said some “pretty horrible” things.Since December 2022, Tate has been facing charges in Romania of human trafficking, rape, and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women, which he denies.Many politicians and teachers have spoken out against Tate’s influence on young boys in the UK, after the self-proclaimed misogynist said women belonged in the home and were a man’s property. “There’s no way you can be rooted in reality and not be sexist,” Tate said in one video.In other clips reported by the Observer, the British-American kickboxer – who poses with fast cars and guns, and portrays himself as a cigar-smoking playboy – talks about hitting and choking women, trashing their belongings and stopping them from going out. He has now been banned from YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok.Farage’s interviews on the podcasts demonstrate how he has been attempting to appeal to younger audiences on a series of controversialist podcasts and online shows aimed at younger men.He has ranged from arguing against diversity quotas for BAME people, saying “the idea we should give people jobs according to how suntanned they are, the colour of their skin” was nonsense, to suggesting that some people on benefits are “too fat … too stupid, too lazy” to work.In his Strike It Big podcast appearance in February, Farage said Tate had been “an important voice” for men, who were being told that male culture should be looked down on.“Tate was a very important voice for an emasculated … you three guys, you are all 25, you are all kind of being told you can’t be blokes, you can’t do laddish, fun, bloke things … That’s almost what you’re being told. That masculinity is something we should look down upon, something we should frown upon. It’s like the men are becoming feminine and the women are becoming masculine and it’s a bit difficult to tell these days who’s what.“And Tate fed into that by saying, ‘Hang on, what’s wrong with being a bloke? What’s wrong in male culture? What’s wrong in male humour?’ He fed into those things. His was a campaign of raising awareness, his was a campaign of giving people perhaps a bit of confidence at school or whatever it was to speak up …”He acknowledged that Tate “maybe took that alter-ego of masculinity too far in his relationships with women” and that some of things he had said and posted “were over the top”. But he said the “jury is out” on investigations into the influencer. Farage was pictured with Tate in 2019, before the legal case in Romania.Elsewhere in the podcast, Farage said: “The banking sector, now full of idiots, people are promoted not because of ability, but ethnicity or gender … The white male – you lot – are going to feel the world’s against you. Andrew Tate tapped into that. You’re going to feel the world’s against you, you’re going to feel resentful and angry … These are massive cultural battles.”In another podcast from August last year, the Disruptors show hosted by Rob Moore, Farage was asked whether he would rather listen to Andrew Tate or Jordan Peterson, the Canadian psychology professor and culture warrior.“I think Jordan Peterson because I think he is a lot more rounded. I think Andrew Tate is a fascinating figure. I think his speaking to men, who because of the woke agenda were told they couldn’t be male in any way at all, was an important thing. But I feel some of his comments were pretty horrible. Jordan has a much more coherent intellectualism to what he does.”Asked about his podcast appearances, including his comments on Tate, Farage said: “There’s an awakening in a younger generation who have had enough of being dictated to, have had enough of being lectured to. They’re seeing through the rubbish they’re getting taught in schools and universities. If no other politician is willing to reach out to this group of people, then I will.”Alex Davies-Jones, a Labour candidate and shadow minister for domestic violence, said Tate was a “dangerous misogynist who is facing multiple charges of human trafficking and sexual offences – and it is inexplicable that a politician would praise him”.Davies-Jones, who has previously faced death and rape threats for criticising Tate’s “brainwashing” of young boys, added: “Tate is not a positive role model for young boys. He will drag them down a horrific rabbit-hole of objectifying and abusing women. It is never just banter – it is part of a toxic culture that sadly often leads to violence.”On an episode of the Your Round podcast, which aired earlier this month, Farage hit out at the idea of hiring policies that take diversity into account, appearing to describe people of colour as being “suntanned”.“The race thing is even worse. The idea we should give people jobs according to how suntanned they are, the colour of their skin … the whole thing is nonsense. A guy who’s my producer at GB News is half Indian. I’m darker than he is! It’s nonsense.” He later added: “Now we’re saying this person gets this job because they’re black, or they’re gay.”In an appearance on the “free speech” Triggernometry podcast, which has almost 1 million subscribers, in February 2023, Farage claimed that “welfarism, I’m afraid, is making millions of people lazy”.“‘I’m too fat, I’m too stupid, I’m too lazy, I don’t get out of bed in the morning. I smoke drugs, give me money’ … That’s what we’re saying. ‘I don’t need to work, the state will provide for me’ … We cannot afford it,” he said.Other rightwing views aired on the podcast included Farage saying he wished that the former Conservative prime minister Liz Truss had “held her nerve” and stuck to her budget as “a lot of it was good thinking” – although he said it was too much, too fast. He also claimed that Jeremy Hunt taking over as chancellor after the budget triggered a negative market reaction was part of a “globalist coup”.In a further interview with a show called Nomad Capitalist in April 2024, Farage had huge praise for Javier Milei, the far-right libertarian Argentine president famous for posing with a chainsaw, saying he had been bringing in “Thatcherism on steroids – this is incredible, cutting and slashing public expenditure, doing all the things he’s done”, adding: “That’s leadership … he is amazing.” When asked to list the best leaders in the western world, Farage named Hungary’s rightwing leader, Viktor Orbán, a “strong leader”, and his “friend” Donald Trump, the US presidential candidate.Previously, in 2016 on Fox News, Farage praised Vladmir Putin, the Russian president, who he said for “all his faults” was a “strong leader who believes in his own nation”.Farage’s interview commentsFebruary 2023“‘I’m too fat, I’m too stupid, I’m too lazy, I don’t get out of bed in the morning. I smoke drugs, give me money’ … That’s what we’re saying. ‘I don’t need to work, the state will provide for me’ … We cannot afford it.“I welcomed much of [Liz Truss’s] budget. I think if there is a criticism, they tried to do too much, too quickly, without prior explanation … What happened here is the backbenches wobbled really quite quickly because a lot of Conservative backbenchers are basically globalists and listened to those big noises from the multinationals and the IMF. As soon as she sacked Kwarteng, it was all over … I would much have preferred her to hold her nerve, keep making those arguments and see if the party dared get rid of them.”August 2023“I think Andrew Tate is a fascinating figure. I think his speaking to men, who because of the woke agenda were told they couldn’t be male in any way at all, was an important thing. But I feel some of his comments were pretty horrible.”February 2024 “Tate was a very important voice for an emasculated … You three guys, you are all 25, you are all kind of being told you can’t be blokes, you can’t do laddish, fun, bloke things … That’s almost what you’re being told. That masculinity is something we should look down upon, something we should frown upon. It’s like the men are becoming feminine and the women are becoming masculine and it’s a bit difficult to tell these days who’s what.”April 2024 Javier Milei is “Thatcherism on steroids – this is incredible, cutting and slashing public expenditure, doing all the things he’s done … That’s leadership … He is amazing.”June 2024 “The race thing is even worse. The idea we should give people jobs according to how suntanned they are, the colour of their skin … the whole thing is nonsense. A guy who’s my producer at GB News is half Indian. I’m darker than he is! It’s nonsense.”"
The Telegraph,Starmer refuses to repeat ‘Corbyn better as PM than Johnson’ claim,"['‘I have changed Labour’', '‘Difficult days’']",Timothy Sigsworth,21 June 2024 at 1:34 pm·3-min read,21,June,2024,01:34:00,3,"Sir Keir Starmer has refused to repeat his claim that Jeremy Corbyn would have been a better prime minister than Boris Johnson.The Labour Party leader was asked on Friday about a remark he made during the BBC Question Time special on Thursday night.Hosting the programme, Fiona Bruce asked him five times to explain why he had said in the run-up to the 2019 election that Mr Corbyn would be a “great prime minister”.Sir Keir eventually said: “He would be a better prime minister… look what we got, Boris Johnson, a man who made massive promises, didn’t keep them, and then had to leave Parliament in disgrace.”Speaking to broadcasters on Friday, Sir Keir did not repeat those words but said: “The choice at the last election before the electorate was not a good choice.Sir Keir appearing in the Question Time special on Thursday night - BBC“You had Boris Johnson, who won and then three years later was thrown out of Parliament for breaking the rules, you had Jeremy Corbyn who is now expelled from the Labour Party.“That’s why I have been so determined to change the Labour Party and to make sure that that changed Labour Party puts forward a credible manifesto for growth so that at this election, there will be a real choice between carrying on with the failure of the last 14 years or turning the page and rebuilding the country with a Labour government.”‘I have changed Labour’Asked again if he thought Mr Corbyn would have been a better premier, Sir Keir said: “I have changed the Labour Party because after that election result, we needed to ensure we were a party which proudly said ‘country first, party second’, with a manifesto for change, and that’s what we have put before the electorate.”Peter Kyle, Labour’s shadow science secretary, earlier declined to say if he also believed Mr Corbyn would have been a better prime minister than Mr Johnson.Asked the question four times by LBC’s Nick Ferrari, he repeated an identical answer each time.‘Difficult days’“Those were difficult days in our politics, and we each had to find our own way through it,” Mr Kyle said.He added: “But the key thing is in 2019, we had that general election, and the voters told us definitively. If you’re in politics, you’ve got to listen to voters, and they told us definitively that our party had to change.“Keir Starmer led our party through that change and he now has a party that’s fit for service because of the change.”Since winning the party leadership in 2020, Sir Keir has distanced himself from his predecessor, who is standing against Labour as an independent.He was criticised last week for describing the Conservative manifesto as a “sort of Jeremy Corbyn-style manifesto where anything you want can go in it, none of it is costed”.He supported the manifestos drawn up for the 2017 and 2019 elections during Mr Corbyn’s leadership.Momentum, the Left-wing campaign group, said Sir Keir was guilty of “attacking your own side” and Sir Simon Clarke, the Tory ex-minister, criticised him for his “sheer nerve”."
The Telegraph,Rishi Sunak declines to rule out a minister is involved in gambling scandal,['‘Betting on inside info stinks’'],Ben Riley-Smith,21 June 2024 at 3:18 pm·4-min read,21,June,2024,03:18:00,4,"Rishi Sunak has declined to rule out that a Cabinet minister is involved in the Tory gambling scandal.The Gambling Commission is looking into four figures with links to the Prime Minister over allegations they bet on a July election before it was announced using insider knowledge.The commission is understood to be working through a list of names provided by bookmakers of people who made £200 or more betting on a July general election in the three weeks before it was made public.On Friday, the Prime Minister was twice asked to publicly rule out that a Cabinet minister could be involved.During a press conference at the launch of the Welsh Tories’ manifesto, Mr Sunak was asked whether he was confident a Cabinet minister had not placed a bet on a July election.The Prime Minister responded by saying the revelations had left him “incredibly angry” and that it was “right they are investigated” but fell short of explicitly ruling out the development.Asked again, Mr Sunak said: “The job of the Gambling Commission and the police is to investigate anything that they think that is not right.“And they should be allowed to get on with that, and it’s not for you or anyone else to speculate on that.”Senior party insiders insisted that they did not currently believe a Cabinet minister was involved.However, it is understood that Conservative Campaign Headquarters does not know who else could be caught up in the Gambling Commission investigations and is braced for other Tories to be named.There was a sudden rush of bets on the possibility of a July 4 election on May 21, according to betting data analysis. The snap election was announced by Mr Sunak the following day.Four figures are currently known to be under investigation.Craig Williams, a senior aide to Mr Sunak who is also an MP candidate, is being investigated by the Gambling Commission after reporting getting £100 on the election date just before it was called. He has apologised for having a “flutter” on the election.Tony Lee, the Conservative director of campaigning, and Laura Saunders, his wife and a Tory candidate, are also both understood to be under investigation by the commission.Both Mr Williams and Ms Saunders remain Tory candidates for the election.A police officer working in Mr Sunak’s close protection team has also been arrested as part of a separate investigation into bets placed on the timing of the election.Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s shadow paymaster general, jumped on Mr Sunak’s refusal to rule out that a Cabinet minister could be involved. He said: “Today Rishi Sunak has refused to rule out that further members of the Conservative Party, including Cabinet ministers, are involved in this betting scandal. He needs to come clean with the public.“He promised integrity, professionalism and accountability, instead his weakness means he has overseen the same levels of sleaze and scandal that have come to epitomise the last 14 years of Tory government.“Rishi Sunak needs to take immediate action against all implicated.”Angela Rayner added that the Prime Minister “should reveal what he knows about what happened – and also I find it astonishing that action hasn’t been taken in regards to that”.It comes as polling by YouGov found that the Conservative betting scandal was the one of the news stories about which the British public were most aware this week.Some 17 per cent of respondents said they had noticed the story, compared to 8 per cent being aware of coverage of the European Championship.Mr Sunak has insisted that if anyone is found to have broken the rules they will be thrown out of the Conservative Party, but he said it was important to wait for the outcome of the investigation.‘Betting on inside info stinks’On Friday, Tom Tugendhat, the security minister, expected to run for the Tory leadership at the next contest, told The Telegraph: “Betting on inside information stinks. It’s wrong and those involved must go.”A Conservative spokesman said: “We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals.“As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn’t be proper to comment further until any process is concluded.”In a statement, Ms Saunders’ solicitor said that she would be cooperating with the watchdog’s investigation.The statement added: “It is inappropriate to conduct any investigation of this kind via the media, and doing so risks jeopardising the work of the Gambling Commission and the integrity of its investigation.”A spokesman for the Gambling Commission said: “Currently, the commission is investigating the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election.“This is an ongoing investigation, and the commission cannot provide any further details at this time.“We are not confirming or denying the identity of any individuals involved in this investigation.”"
Yahoo News UK,"3 electoral maps that show how disastrous the election could be for the ToriesWith new modelling predicting a Labour victory even bigger than Tony Blair's 1997 landslide, the outlook for Rishi Sunak is not looking good.",['Which Tory ministers are at risk of losing their seats?'],James Cheng-Morris and  James Hockaday,Updated 5 June 2024 at 8:34 am·4-min read,5,June,2024,08:34:00,4,"The outlook was already looking bleak for the Conservative Party when Rishi Sunak called the general election following months of dismal approval ratings that showed little sign of improving.At a campaign event last week, Sunak said he didn't think defeat to Labour was a ""foregone conclusion"", suggesting his main election rival Sir Keir Starmer was taking the British electorate ""for granted"".However, a general election projection released on Monday will have added to the Tories' woes – predicting the biggest win for Labour in the party's history, surpassing even that of Tony Blair's 1997 landslide.The analysis, carried out by YouGov for Sky News, used a relatively new polling technique called Multi-level Regression and Post-stratification (MRP), which is regarded to have had a good track record and can provide detailed predictions at a constituency level basis. The scale of Sunak's problems is demonstrated by the interactive maps below, showing just how much ground the Tories are expected to lose compared to their 2019 victory.Click on the arrows in the top left to switch between the two maps. Check your own constituency to see if it is projected to change handsThe first map above shows the seats won in the 2019 general election, when Boris Johnson led the party to a stunning majority.The wall of Tory blue on the map, compared to the spots of Labour red, is a demonstration of just how far Labour, then led by Jeremy Corbyn, had fallen in public standing. The result was Labour's worst electoral performance since 1935.If you toggle to the second map, the projection by YouGov (which was based on polling carried out between 24 May - 1 June) suggests that Starmer's party is on track to win 422 seats, with the Tories down to just 140.Such a result would be the Conservative Party's worst performance at a general election since 1906. If YouGov's predictions are accurate, Labour winning a 194-seat majority would be the highest number since Conservative Stanley Baldwin won a majority of 208 in 1924.The model suggests the Conservatives could be set for near wipeout across many areas of the country, including London, the North East, the North West, and Wales.It also projects that the Scottish National Party would lose more than half their seats, with Labour returning as the largest party north of the border, and the Liberal Democrats reclaiming its place as the third party of British politics – winning 48 seats.The new figures, released yesterday, came as Reform UK co-founder Nigel Farage announced that he would be returning as the populist party's leader and would stand for election in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. Even before Farage's latest bid, pollsters told Yahoo News that Reform UK could pose a serious threat to the Tories by splitting the vote and potentially handing even more seats to Labour.The YouGov projection follows a similar poll by modelling site Electoral Calculus, which came out on 31 May. The polling also compares the 2019 result with Electoral Calculus' projection.It predicts that Labour is on course to win an even bigger majority of 319 seats - with Starmer's party picking up 485 MPs and the Tories way behind with 66. The modelling shows the Lib Dems getting very close to the Conservative Party, with 59 seats.While Electoral Calculus' polling, based on opinion polls from 8 May to 20 May, returns a different set of projections to YouGov's, both clearly indicate the scale of the problem facing Sunak.The Electoral Calculus model has predicted Sir Keir Starmer's Labour will win a massive majority.

The Telegraph,Labour adviser sounds alarm on Keir Starmer’s City tax raid,[],Szu Ping Chan,21 June 2024 at 9:35 am·3-min read,21,June,2024,09:35:00,3,"Sir Keir Starmer's crackdown could 'change the economics [of investments] dramatically' - Labour PartyLabour risks destroying a key investment pipeline helping to grow the UK’s next generation of $1bn businesses if it launches a tax raid on the City, one of its advisers has warned.Anne Glover, chief executive of Amadeus Capital Partners, a venture capitalist firm that has invested in 190 mostly British businesses, said Sir Keir Starmer’s proposed crackdown on private equity would “change the economics [of investments] dramatically” and lead to an exodus of cash and talent in the sector.Venture capitalists hope to back growth businesses, taking big risks to fund small companies with prospects of becoming much larger concerns.ADVERTISEMENTTypically the goal is to find potential “unicorns”, which are companies with a valuation of at least $1bn.While Ms Glover, who was one of 10 advisers Labour consulted as part of its review of financial services, said the party “absolutely” understood the importance of supporting entrepreneurs, she told the Telegraph that proposals to change the treatment of so-called carried interest would cost the Exchequer money instead of bringing it in.Carried interest is one of the main ways that fund managers at private equity and venture capitalist firms pay themselves.Currently the share of a fund’s investment profits is taxed at the capital gains rate of 28pc. Labour wants to close what it has branded a “loophole” and treat this performance-related pay as income. This would mean the money would be taxed at 45pc for most individuals.But Ms Glover said companies would be forced to reappraise their investment if the rules were changed.“It would change the economics for all of the people who work in it dramatically,” she said. “Instead of working for 10 to 12 years to achieve a great capital outcome alongside entrepreneurs who are also getting a great capital outcome, you get taxed as if it was income, which it isn’t.”An attempt to change carried interest rules in the US was blocked by a senator in 2022.Ms Glover said: “It’s recognised worldwide that it’s appropriately taxed as capital gain. So we would be quite out of step with the rest of Europe and the US if we did change those rules.”Story continuesShe warned that the consequences for the economy from an exodus of talent and capital were huge.Ms Glover said: “I would predict that they would lose as much in lost activity because the private equity guys can move, they’ll just go live somewhere else.”She added that for venture capital firms like hers that must stay in the UK to support the early-stage companies they invest in, the impact would be more insidious.Ms Glover said: “I think it’s a long term consequence, not a short term consequence. I think you’ll just attract less talent into the business and [by that] I mean less successful companies.”Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has already suggested that fund managers who make bets with their own money will continue to see capital gains taxed as such. However, the Labour Party also estimates it could raise more than £500m from the roughly 2,000 people who receive carried interest each year.“We [put ourselves] at risk for years. We accept lower salaries – massively lower salaries than the rest of the financial industry. We take personal risk by putting our own money alongside our investors. And then if we are successful – and by the way it’s only half of firms that are ever successful – the ones [that are] get a large lump sum, probably eight to 14 years after you start working on a portfolio,” said Ms Glover.“So then, to have taken all of that risk and done it at a much reduced income level in order to align yourself with [other investors] and entrepreneurs, both of whom get taxed on capital gains, why should we be treated differently?”"
The Telegraph,Conservatives’ private donations down 90 per cent on last election campaign,['Significant donors'],Timothy Sigsworth,21 June 2024 at 0:37 pm·2-min read,21,June,2024,00:37:00,2,"The Conservatives have received just a tenth of the private donations they did in 2019 in a stark revelation of the state of the party’s campaign finances.Figures released by the Electoral Commission show the party brought in £889,000 from private sources in the first two weeks of the campaign.That figure represents only a tenth of the £8.7 million raked in during the same period in the 2019 election.Labour received private donations worth £4.2 million in the second week of the campaign, 14 times as much as the Conservatives who received £292,500 between June 6 and 12.It brings the total donations given to Sir Keir Starmer’s party in the first two weeks of the campaign to £5.1 million.The Conservatives’ largest donations in the second week of the campaign were £50,000 each from Bestway Wholesale, a company ultimately owned by Tory peer Lord Zameer Choudrey through the Guernsey-based Bestway Group, and an organisation called The Spring Lunch.The Spring Lunch is an unincorporated association and therefore does not have to provide records of who controls it, although it is registered to an address in Pulham St Mary, Norfolk.Significant donorsLabour’s largest donation was £2.5 million from Lord Sainsbury, the former chairman of the eponymous supermarket chain who gave £8 million to the Liberal Democrats in 2019.Other significant donors were Gary Lubner, the Autoglass chief, who gave £900,000, and hedge fund manager Martin Taylor, who donated £700,000.In total, Labour’s private donations for the first two weeks of the campaign amounted to £5,157,400, more than 14 times the £361,042 they received throughout the entirety of the 2019 campaign.The Electoral Commission figures, which collate donations from private individuals and companies between June 6 and 12, also show that Reform UK brought in donations worth more than three times more than those given to the Conservatives.Nigel Farage’s party raised a total of £742,000, largely thanks to a £500,000 donation from Britain Means Business Ltd, a company controlled by Richard Tice, the party chairman.Reform also received £50,000 from Holly Valance, the former pop star and Neighbours actor who is a prominent supporter.The Liberal Democrats received £335,000 in the second week of the campaign, taking their total for the election to £789,999.Other donations included £150,000 from businessman Safwan Adam and a £100,000 bequest from John Faulkner, a long-standing party member who left the party £1 million in his will in 2023.Political parties are required to provide weekly reports of donations of more than £11,180, after the Government increased the threshold from £7,500 in January."
Sky News,Tory donors go on strike... Perhaps Sunak should dip into his own pockets?,[],Sky News,21 June 2024 at 11:58 am·3-min read,21,June,2024,11:58:00,3,"Follow the money, the saying goes. But the money isn't following the Conservative Party in this election campaign. Tory donors are on strike.The Conservatives are not only being massively outgunned financially by Labour, but also by Reform UK and the Liberal Democrats, according to new figures.Election latest: More bad news for Tory campaign The slump in donations, compared with the millions pouring into Tory coffers during Boris Johnson's 2019 campaign, suggests massive disillusionment in Rishi Sunak among Tory tycoons and millionaires.Why throw good money after bad? That's a question the Conservatives' former big money donors must be asking themselves with Mr Sunak's campaign appearing to lurch from one crisis to another.And the party's dismal showing in opinion polls, along with blunders like the prime minister's D-Day fiasco and now a scandal over insiders accused of betting on the election date, suggest the funding gap will get even worse.The latest figures from the Electoral Commission, generally a fairly toothless watchdog, are the first since Mr Sunak's calamitous snub to D-Day veterans and also confirm that Nigel Farage's comeback has boosted Reform UK's finances.The figures are staggeringUsually, league tables of donations to political parties put the Tories way out in front. Not this time. Donations between 6 and 12 June reveal the Conservatives are in fourth place. That's relegation form.In that week, Labour received a breathtaking £4,383,400, largely due to a £2.5m cheque from Lord Sainsbury of the supermarket dynasty. That means £5.3m in donations rolled in during the first two weeks of the campaign.A big Blairite, Lord Sainsbury is a long-time donor who stopped giving when Jeremy Corbyn was leader. But now he's back. Big time. Labour's other big donor, Autoglass windscreens tycoon Gary Lubner, gave £900,000.At election time, the general secretaries of the big trade unions usually get their cheque book out and hand over six or seven-figure sums. But between 6-12 June the only union donation was £100,000 from the train drivers' union Aslef.That means Sir Keir Starmer's Labour Party is relying more now on millionaires than union barons for its election fighting fund. The Labour leader says the party's changed. Well, this is certainly a very significant change.Read more:Farage: West 'provoked' Russia's invasion of UkraineAnalysis: Sunak misjudged audience on key issueBut at what price? Are the millionaire donors buying influence on Labour's tax policy: capital gains tax, wealth taxes and so on? And what will the tycoons' millions mean for Angela Rayner's workers' rights proposals?The Conservatives' election war chest, meanwhile, is almost bare and their finances as dire as their opinion poll ratings: just £292,500 in 6-12 June and only £882,000 in donations in the first two weeks of the campaign.The resurgent Reform UK raised £742,000 in donations, largely from two £250,000 donations from a company called Britain Means Business, which just happens to be run by Richard Tice, the former leader.Mr Tice may have been elbowed aside by Mr Farage, who's replaced him as leader, but he's still personally bankrolling the party, which claims to have received £1.5m since Mr Farage bounced back.Reform UK has also benefitted from a showbiz donation from celebrity supporter Holly Vukadinovic - the pop star and former Neighbours actor Holly Valance - who had a hit with Kiss Kiss and donated 50,000 smackers.Even the Liberal Democrats, with £335,000, received more than the Conservatives, including £100,000 in the will of late party donor and former lawyer John Faulkner.

PA Media: UK News,Sunak vows to boot out Tories if they are found to have broken betting rules,[],"Sophie Wingate, David Lynch and Rhiannon James, PA Political Staff",21 June 2024 at 2:45 am·5-min read,21,June,2024,02:45:00,5,"Rishi Sunak said Tory figures who are found to have broken gambling rules “should face the full force of the law”, as he is likely to face further questions on the betting scandal engulfing his faltering election campaign.The Prime Minister said he was “incredibly angry to learn” of the allegations that a string of people with links to the Conservative Party or No 10 bet on the timing of the July 4 contest before he announced it.Concerns over political insiders profiting from the election date could overshadow his campaigning on Friday, when he is at the Welsh Conservative manifesto launch in Kinmel Bay.Mr Sunak was asked during a bruising appearance on Thursday night’s BBC Question Time leaders’ special whether the betting allegations were “the absolute epitome of the lack of ethics” displayed by the Conservative Party in recent years.The Prime Minister replied: “I was incredibly angry – incredibly angry – to learn of these allegations.“It’s a really serious matter. It’s right that they’re being investigated properly by the relevant law enforcement authorities, including … a criminal investigation by the police.Calls of ‘shame’ could be heard after Rishi Sunak said he would prioritise the UK’s security over the European Convention on Human Rights (Stefan Rousseau/PA)“I want to be crystal clear that if anyone has broken the rules, they should face the full force of the law.”Conservative candidate Laura Saunders said she “will be co-operating with the Gambling Commission” probe, while her husband, the Tories’ director of campaigning, Tony Lee, took a leave of absence amid reports the couple were being investigated by the gambling regulator.It came after the arrest of one of the Prime Minister’s police protection officers and the previous revelation of a Gambling Commission investigation into his parliamentary aide, Craig Williams..@RishiSunak, as you won’t suspend your insider betting scandal candidates, do you think they are fit to be MPs?— The Labour Party (@UKLabour) June 20, 2024Labour and the Lib Dems have called on the Tories to suspend both Ms Saunders and Mr Williams, who is standing in Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr.Pressed on those demands, Mr Sunak said the investigations were ongoing and the “integrity of that process must be respected”.But, he added: “What I can tell you is if anyone is found to have broken the rules, not only should they face the full consequences of the law, I will make sure that they are booted out of the Conservative Party.”Betfair data appears to show a flurry of bets on a July poll placed on May 21, the day before Mr Sunak called the election, including some in the hundreds of pounds at odds that would have delivered profits in the thousands.Despite the Conservatives’ dismal poll ratings failing to improve since Mr Sunak made the move – with four major polls this week even predicting the worst Tory electoral result ever – the Prime Minister insisted he had chosen the “right moment” for the contest.On Friday, he will ramp up his warnings about handing Labour “a blank cheque” at the election, claiming Sir Keir Starmer’s party will “change every rule they can” to ensure they stay in government once they gain power.Sir Keir Starmer defended his support of Jeremy Corbyn’s 2019 manifesto, despite recently comparing it to Rishi Sunak’s policy offering (Stefan Rousseau/PA)Meanwhile, Sir Keir said Jeremy Corbyn would have been a better prime minister than Boris Johnson.The Labour leader is heading north of the border on Friday to pledge that Labour’s industrial strategy would deliver 69,000 jobs in Scotland as he seeks to cement his party’s resurgence there.Visiting a business alongside Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, Sir Keir will vow to “turn the page on an era of economic turmoil under the Tories and the SNP”.In his Question Time grilling, the Labour leader ducked a volley of questions over whether he truly believed his predecessor would make a “great” premier.When host Fiona Bruce asked for a “yes or no” answer to whether he meant his one-time statement, there was laughter from the audience when he did not give one, instead saying that Mr Corbyn would have made a better prime minister than Mr Johnson.Sir Ed Davey said it was difficult being in government with the Tories during the coalition years (Stefan Rousseau/PA)Sir Ed was challenged by a student over the Lib Dems abandoning their pledge to scrap tuition fees in the coalition government.He said: “I understand why your generation lost faith in us. It was a difficult government to be in.”The Lib Dem leader was also asked whether he was “proud” of his conduct as postal affairs minister between 2010 and 2012.SNP leader John Swinney said the Tory Government had been a ‘total disaster and calamity’ (Stefan Rousseau/PA)He said he made “two big mistakes during that time”, including failing to meet Sir Alan Bates in 2010 – although he subsequently did agree to meet the campaigner – and not seeing through assurances given to him by the Post Office that Sir Alan’s assertions were not true.The Lib Dem leader will call for urgent reform to end the “appalling situation” in NHS dentistry as he hits the campaign trail on Friday.Scotland’s First Minister and SNP leader, John Swinney, suggested he would prefer Sir Keir over Mr Sunak, telling the BBC programme: “The Conservative Government has been a total disaster and a calamity”.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, who complained about being excluded from the four-way leaders’ panel but will feature in a separate Question Time next week, is expected to campaign in Clacton on Friday before a high-profile Panorama interview."
Yahoo News UK,Who is Ed Davey? Lib Dem leader attracts attention with election stuntsEverything you need to know about the former minister who has pledged to fight for the NHS.,[],Hannah Fearn,7 June 2024 at 11:47 am·7-min read,7,June,2024,11:47:00,7,"Ed Davey has been involved in a number of comedy stunts since the election was called. (Alamy) With the spotlight on prime minister Rishi Sunak and Labour leader Keir Starmer as they prepare to slug it out in a general election campaign, the focus had started slipping from Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey until a series of stunts put him back in the spotlight.The former coalition government cabinet minister - who lost his seat, punished by voters for getting into bed with the Tories, but then won it back again - is sending a clear message that he should not be overlooked.He’s had a long political career and the climax may still be ahead: if polls continue to shift away from the Conservatives at the current trajectory, there’s a slim possibility that, if the election is held in October, he could end up as Leader of the Opposition.So what do we know about the man behind the third party in British politics? Hannah Fearn finds out.His early lifeEd Davey was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on Christmas Day in 1965. He was the youngest of three boys, but lost his father at just four years old, and his mother followed over a decade later when he was in his mid-teens. She spent three years battling cancer, during which time he nursed his mother together with his grandmother and brother Henry.Once a keen Scout and Air Scout, he later remembers feeling “isolated” at school because of his caring responsibilities, which meant he couldn’t take part in after-school activities or sports. “The last 18 months she was bedridden and in a lot of pain. I’d spend hours on the bed, talking to her,” he said. Davey was with his mother when she died at Nottingham General Hospital, after being placed on an unsuited dementia ward.After both his parents had died, Davey was brought up by his maternal grandparents in the village of Eakring, though his grandfather died soon after. He spent much of his childhood and young adulthood close to his grandmother. “First of all, she was looking after me. Then we were looking after each other,” he said.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

Gasson stood in four elections but failed to win a seat and is now a councillor. The pair have two children, a son and daughter.Their son, born in 2007 and now a teenager, is disabled with a neurological condition. He attended special schools but is now educated at home with a tutor - a change that Davey said led to him becoming verbal for the first time. He has spoken about his anxiety about who will care for his son when he and his wife are no longer around. “It’s the thing that worries me more than anything else in my life,” he said.Gasson was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in 2012. She was well for many years following her diagnosis, but declined during lockdown and is working on recovering her physical strength.Liberal Democrats election broadcast shows Ed Davey with his son. (Liberal Democrats)His parentsHis father, John, was a solicitor and his mother, Nina, a teacher. Davey has described how he was inspired to study by his mother, who always wanted him to try hard academically and who he wanted to impress.His educationDavey attended the private Nottingham High School, the alma mater of former chancellor Kenneth Clarke. He became head boy, with Labour MP Ed Balls - who was studying in the year below - watching on. After school, he achieved a first class degree in philosophy, politics and economics at Jesus College, Oxford where he was junior common room president. After becoming an economics research for the Liberal Democrats he returned to study, reading for a master’s degree in economics at Birkbeck College, London.Ed Davey, pictured with his family. (Liberal Democrats)Why is he a sir?For three years, the Lib Dem leader was a member of the cabinet during the period of Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, holding the post of secretary of state for energy and climate change from 2012 to 2015. He was knighted in the 2016 New Year’s Honours for “political and public services”.Davey on... the cost of living crisisDavey has repeatedly attacked the government for failing to curb rapid inflation and the devastating effect it is having on household budgets. He called the Conservative Party “so out of touch they might as well be living on another planet”, and said he warned Jeremy Hunt “people are desperate for real help… but all the chancellor could offer is empty words and unfair tax hikes”. In particular, he has urged more action on food price inflation, which analysis from his own party found had risen 37 per cent in one year for the average weekly supermarket trip. He has promised to end energy hikes and abandoned his plan to add 1p to income tax to save the NHS because ordinary voters can no longer afford it.Davey on... the NHSThe Liberal Democrats have made the NHS a cornerstone of their policy platform for the last five years. In Davey’s words: “Voting Conservative is bad for your health.” He promises to reverse cuts to GP numbers and guarantee a doctor’s appointment when you need one, improve access to NHS dentistry and save lives by tackling ambulance call out delays. Davey blames the care crisis for deepening the problems of the health service and says his party would spend £5bn a year on a “care package” to ensure patients are discharged from hospital more quickly, freeing up bed space. However, there is little detail on how this would be financed without raising taxes on the wealthiest - which Davey has promised not to do in his push to poach disillusioned Tory voters.British Leader of the Liberal Democrats party Ed Davey arrives at the BBC Broadcasting House, for his appearance on 'Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg', in London, Britain, April 28, 2024. REUTERS/Maja SmiejkowskaDavey on... immigrationThe Lib Dem leader has been a long-standing advocate for refugee rights and critic of the government’s immigration policy. He has called for Conservative plans to deport failed asylum seekers to Rwanda a “cynical distraction” from the partygate crisis and the money would be better spent on measures to tackle the cost of living crisis. He added: “They’ve provided no evidence to suggest that this new policy will stop illegal smuggling, they’re not cracking down on the organised crime gangs, which is what you need to do.” He has called for a new right to work for refugees and asylum seekers, and major reform of the Home Office which he says is no longer up to the job. After the end of the coalition government, Davey has said his party “was wrong” to go along with the introduction of a minimum income standard for immigrants. He later described the policy as “nasty and unfair”.Davey on... the Post Office scandalDespite the Horizon scandal that led to the wrongful prosecution of more than 700 subpostmasters crossing the tenure of more than a dozen business secretaries, Ed Davey has recently taken the heat for failing to investigate the issue while he was in the job.It has emerged that Davey initially rejected a request to meet justice campaigner Alan Bates, and later accepted it only on the advice that it would be good for his PR. He has recently apologised for not acting earlier, admitting that he is sorry that he “did not see through Post Office lies” about the fault in the Horizon programme."
The Independent,Tories ‘held in contempt by the electorate’ as pressure mounts on Rishi Sunak over betting scandal,[],Kate Devlin and Andy Gregory,21 June 2024 at 2:21 pm·5-min read,21,June,2024,02:21:00,5,"Sir Keir Starmer has accused Rishi Sunak of “total lack of leadership” after the prime minister failed to deny cabinet ministers are among senior Tories who placed bets on the election date.As pressure mounted over the betting scandal, Labour also condemned Mr Sunak’s decision not to suspend two candidates who are under investigation by the Gambling Commission.Multiple cabinet ministers were forced to deny they had had a flutter on the polling date before it was announced to the public.And as questions grew over what the prime minister knew and when, the Liberal Democrats called for WhatsApps from his inner circle to be probed.Dominic Grieve, the former Tory attorney general, warned the party was “held in contempt” by voters.It came as new figures showed the Tories had been dwarfed by Labour on fundraising, raising just £292,500 between 6-12 June compared to £4.4m.Amid Tory fears the scandal will spread, defence secretary Grant Shapps told The Independent he had not placed a bet.Rishi Sunak continues to face questions about allegations Conservative candidates may have placed bets on the date of the election before he announced it (PA Wire)Welsh secretary David TC Davies said: “I just want to put on record that I certainly haven’t bet myself”.It is understood that transport secretary Mark Harper did not place a bet, while friends of Commons leader Penny Mordaunt say she did not either.Chancellor Jeremy Hunt referred questions from The Independent to his press office.The scandal has seen the party’s director of campaigning, Tony Lee, “take a leave of absence” in the middle of the election. Meanwhile, his wife Laura Saunders – a candidate in Bristol and who has worked for the party since 2015 – and Craig Williams, Mr Sunak’s parliamentary private secretary, are under investigation for placing bets on the poll date just before the surprise snap election was announced.Mr Williams, who is Mr Sunak’s closest aide, has admitted he made a “huge error of judgement” betting on the election date.Campaigning in Wales, Mr Sunak refused to be drawn on whether he was aware of other Conservative candidates or officials who had placed bets on a 4 July election, saying there were “multiple investigations” under way that were “independent” and “confidential”.He dodged a follow-up question on whether he could rule out a member of the cabinet having also placed a bet, instead repeating that it was a job for the Gambling Commission and the police to investigate.Anyone found to have broken the rules should “not only face the full consequences of the law, but I will ensure that they are booted out of the Conservative Party too”, he added.The Conservatives have confirmed they have been contacted by the commission “about a small number of individuals”.Craig Williams served as the prime minister’s parliamentary private secretary (PA Media)Sir Keir said: “The prime minister is showing a total lack of leadership. Of course he should suspend these candidates. If they were my candidates, they’d be gone by now, out of the door. He needs to take tough action. He’s not even saying today whether there are more involved.”Liberal Democrats have called for WhatsApps about betting to be investigated. The party’s Sarah Olney said: “WhatsApp messages of the Prime Minister’s inner circle must be handed over to the Cabinet Office, or else it raises suspicion of yet more Conservative cover-ups.”Mr Sunak has said he is “incredibly angry” that members of his inner circle have been caught up in the furore over bets on the date of the election.But he has refused to suspend either candidate.Betfair data appears to show a flurry of bets on a July election were placed on 21 May – the day before Mr Sunak made his suprise announcement – including some worth hundreds of pounds at odds that would have delivered returns in the thousands.David TC Davies (Getty Images)Paul Scully, a former Tory minister, described the looming vote as a “punishment election” for the party, that the outcry over gambling allegations would exacerbate.“It feels like we’re shooting ourselves in the foot and we’re not millipedes. We’ve only got two feet,” he said. “When you’ve got people that are wanting to punish the Conservatives and so they’re going to be looking under the microscope at absolutely everything that we do and then we’re making it easy for them to punish us even further on that basis.”Mr Grieve said that voters recognised the “good” the Coalition Government did until 2015, “despite the pain” of austerity but expected a much better period to follow.Instead, he said Brexit led to “a high level of political chaos which was thoroughly predictable and therefore rests upon the shoulders of those who created it in the first place, namely those who advocated a reckless policy.“And then to solve it, because they were becoming desperate, they went and got themselves a prime minister who was in fact a charlatan. And he behaved exactly a way that was both predictable and predicted.“And in fact, for all his boosterism and the fact he took them to an extraordinary election, because charlatanism often works in the short term, people landed in the long term with a massive problem of loss of public confidence, and then loss of public confidence in the integrity of government.”Dominic Grieve, the former Tory attorney general, said the party was getting what “they deserve” after years of chaos (AFP via Getty Images)“Then they were so desperate … they went off and got somebody who wrecked the economy in 49 days and caused even more trouble.”He added: “They seem to be surprised that having done all this receiving recognition they deserve their efforts. But it seems to me that getting exactly the recognition they deserve for their efforts. Which is that they’re held in contempt by the electorate.”He added that that was “unfair in one sense” to many, including the current prime minister. But he added: “It should not come as a surprise to them that this is a punishment election”."

A recent Telegraph poll predicted the Prime Minister will become the first ever to lose his seat at a general election.Here is everything you need to know about the election night timings.When will election results be announced?Results from the 2024 general election will begin to trickle in from around 11pm on Thursday July 4, following the closing of polling stations at 10pm.Most of the constituency results are expected in the early hours of Friday July 5, with the final seats projected to announce their winners by 10am.In 2019, the first declaration came at 11.27pm when Newcastle City Council beat local rival Sunderland to announce Labour’s candidate Chi Onwurah as the first MP of the new parliament.The record for the earliest declaration remains 10.43pm by the former seat of Sunderland South in 2001.When was the 2019 election result called?Boris Johnson won a sweeping victory for the Conservatives in 2019 after selling the public on his mandate to “get Brexit done”.The first exit polls came back just after 10pm when polls had closed and Mr Johnson’s overall majority was confirmed at 5am.By 7am, it became clear the Tories were on course for their biggest majority at Westminster since that of Margaret Thatcher.What happens when results start being called?When voting closes, an exit poll will be announced following a survey of voters taken from about 150 constituencies in England, Scotland and Wales, giving an indication of the likely result.However, leaders will have to wait until one party receives enough votes for a majority under the first-past-the-post electoral system.In 2019, Mr Johnson’s majority was announced at 5am, although it was not until every constituency had called its results that the extent of his landslide victory with a 43 per cent vote share emerged.When is the general election?The UK will head to the polls on Thursday July 4 to vote on the country’s next leader, with polling stations open between 7am and 10pm.The Prime Minister announced the snap summer election in a rain-sodden speech outside Downing Street on May 22, setting in motion the vote six weeks later.Registration for the general election has now closed and it is too late to apply for a postal vote. However, those eligible can still use a proxy ballot to have someone vote on their behalf."

The polls have consistently painted a very bleak picture for the prime minister, with Labour holding on to a double-digit poll lead over his Conservatives.Recent by-election results suggest that Labour is likely to win a landslide victory – but there’s still time for the PM to turn it around.Here’s everything you need to know about Sunak and what’s he’s saying about the biggest issues in British politics right now.Early lifeSunak was born in Southampton in 1980, the eldest of three children. His Indian parents both arrived from East Africa in the 1960s. A football-mad boy whose childhood idol was Matt Le Tissier, Sunak was described by the family’s neighbours as a child with “lovely manners”.In his youngest years, the PM attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. According to a recent biography, fellow pupil Ollie Case said: “He was someone that was talked about. The teachers would say: ‘He’s going to be prime minister'.""But, growing up in the 1980s and 90s, he also remembers experiencing racism. “My mother was obsessed with us not having accents,” Sunak has said.Rishi Sunak was football-mad as a boy growing up in Southampton. (ITV)Sunak's familySunak is married to Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian entrepreneur and multi-billionaire. The pair first met in 2004 at Stanford University, his future wife apparently attracted to his “honesty and integrity”.Five years later they married in a two-day Indian wedding held in Bangalore. The couple have two daughters, Krishna and Anoushka, who will turn 13 and 11 this year, both of whom are largely kept out of the public eye.Sunak attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. (Rishi Sunak, Instagram)His parentsYashvir Sunak, Rishi’s father, was born in Kenya. He arrived in the UK to study medicine and then stayed, becoming an NHS GP. His mother, Usha, was born in Tanzania and is a pharmacist.The couple met in Britain and settled in Southampton in the 1970s. Usha is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.His educationAs a teenager Sunak studied at Winchester College where he was, he says, a self-confessed “geek”. According to a recent biography, the “naughtiest” thing the prime minister did during his school days “was to smuggle a hand-held television into the school so that he did not miss any key games of Euro 96”.The childhood home of Rishi Sunak in Southampton. (Getty Images, photo taken in 2022)Perhaps unsurprisingly for someone with such an unblemished record, he went on to become the school’s head boy. Sunak worked while studying, delivering medicines for his mother’s pharmacy and as a waiter at a local Indian restaurant.After school, Sunk read philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, graduating in 2001 with a first class degree. While still at university he held an internship at the Conservative Party campaign headquarters and joined the party, but went on studying before entering politics.He earned his MBA from Stanford in 2006 as a Fulbright Scholar, meaning he was selected among the most promising candidates from the UK.How much is he worth?As prime minister, Rishi Sunak earns £80,807 on top of a salary of £84,144 for being an MP. But his current income from Westminster pales in comparison to his family’s vast wealth through marriage.The Sunday Times valued the couple’s joint fortune at £730m. Murty's father is the co-founder of Infosys, an Indian tech conglomerate, in which she holds shares estimated at around £430m. Her family is also involved in a £900m business arrangement with Amazon in India, and she is a shareholder of multiple other companies.Rishi Sunak's mother is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.Before entering politics Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and a series of hedge funds. He is also known to have invested in blind trusts, in which investments are made without holders knowing where the funds are located. These arrangements reportedly hold Sunak’s own multi-million-pound fortune.His religionSunak is not only the first prime minister of colour and of Indian heritage but he is also the first practising Hindu to hold the biggest job in UK politics.He has spoken of his pride in his Hindu faith, saying, “that’s how I was raised, and that’s how I am”. He said: “Having faith gives you resilience, gives you strength that is important and it provides an outlook on life which I find particularly valuable.”Sunak on... the NHSThe prime minister’s biggest challenge in office has been the crisis in the NHS - and to many people in the sector his government has been found wanting. “We have not made enough progress,” Sunak said when asked about his commitment to cut NHS waiting lists during an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV. Asked if that meant he had failed, the prime minister replied: “Yes, we have.""Sunak expects to see waiting lists start to reduce this spring, and blames the delays on “industrial action”, as disputes with junior doctors and consultants over pay and conditions continue. Yet Sunak himself has been blamed for holding up a deal that would prevent more walkouts.Sunak, his wife Akshata and daughters Anoushka and Krishna (second left) at Santa Monica Pier, California, on their summer holiday in 2023. (AP)Sunak on… immigrationAccording to the prime minister, illegal migration threatens to “overwhelm” Europe. In June 2023 he claimed his plan to “stop the boats” and tackle illegal immigration was working, but by August 2023 he had changed his mind: “It’s not an easy problem to fix,” he told broadcasters. “I never said we would be able to solve it overnight.”He has staked much of his reputation on the government's Rwanda Bill - his plan to deport asylum seekers to the east African country that finally became law last month, after months of legal and procedural challenges. It has paved the way for deportation flights to get off the ground within weeks.He described his policy, which he says will act as a deterrent to people traffickers, as being “the will of the people” – yet polling suggests low support for such a punitive approach.The policy, coupled with Conservative talk of limits on legal migration, shows that the government is committed to taking a hard line on the issue, despite the risk of alienating more moderate voters.The Rwanda policy is not universally popular. (YouGov)Sunak on... the cost of living crisisThe prime minister has told hard-pressed working families that they will feel some relief from the cost of living crisis as inflation continues to drop following its highs of October 2022. He described the government’s tax cuts as “meaningful” and has welcomed the dip in mortgage rates at the turn of the year.Sunak says falling inflation will have the biggest impact on family budgets “and will start to ease some of those pressures” and that he was right to focus on that figure. However, the global drop in energy prices is probably the biggest factor in easing the hit on wallets - something that the prime minister has no control over.However, the fall in inflation to 2.3% on 22 May this year – the lowest it has been in nearly three years – was likely one of the key factors in persuading Sunak to call a snap election many weeks earlier than experts had predicted.Can we expect more handouts or tax breaks to help balance family budgets? Not according to Sunak, who has warned voters that it’s time to “move on” from government support.Sunak on... pensionsThe triple-lock pensions policy is a tricky one for Sunak – especially since Labour has committed to retaining the policy. Any change to a policy that has become a hallmark of recent Conservative governments would not go down well with the 12 million pensioners it would likely impact – many of whom are lifelong Tory voters.Last November, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said pensions should start being pegged to an average of inflation and wage growth, which would help reduce state spending over time.Sunak’s response to that was ambiguous to say the least: “We are the government that has … delivered the triple lock and it is why, right now, pensions are, depending on how you look at it, £800 or £900 bigger than they otherwise would have been.” He is yet to confirm whether it will appear in the manifesto."
The Telegraph,JK Rowling accuses Sir Keir Starmer of ‘abandoning women’,"['‘Still has a woman problem’', '‘We lost sight of people’']",Daniel Martin,21 June 2024 at 2:41 pm·5-min read,21,June,2024,02:41:00,5,"JK Rowling has accused Sir Keir Starmer of “abandoning women” who are concerned about gender ideology.The Harry Potter author accused the Labour leader of having a “dismissive and often offensive” attitude to feminists in a dramatic intervention into the general election.“As long as Labour remains dismissive and often offensive towards women fighting to retain the rights their foremothers thought were won for all time, I’ll struggle to support them,” she said.“The women who wouldn’t wheesht [be quiet] didn’t leave Labour. Labour abandoned them.”Writing in an article for The Times, Ms Rowling also attacked Sir Keir for failing to defend Rosie Duffield, the gender-critical Labour MP who was investigated by her own party and has received death threats for her gender-critical views.“Rosie has received literally no support from Starmer over the threats and abuse, some of which has originated from within the Labour Party itself, and has had a severe, measurable impact on her life,” said Ms Rowling.JK Rowling with Rosie Duffield, Labour candidate for Canterbury - InstagramMs Rowling’s intervention came after Sir Keir Starmer was accused of misogyny by women’s rights groups, who said he had only changed his views on gender after listening to a man.On Thursday night’s BBC Question Time, the Labour leader was asked whether he agreed with Rosie Duffield, Labour candidate, on the issue of sex and gender.Ms Duffield has long argued that spaces for biological women need to be protected, and that trans women should not be viewed as the same as biological women.He replied that he now believed the same as Sir Tony Blair, that men had penises and women vaginas.Ms Duffield, the Labour candidate for Canterbury who was previously investigated by the party over her gender-critical views, tweeted sarcastically: “From now on, I shall be submitting my every comment and thought (particularly those mainstream views which most people agree with) to the former Labour prime minister so that it may officially be de-toxified.”Sir Keir has been criticised over his comments by women’s rights groups Fair Play for Women, the Women’s Rights Network and Sex Matters.‘Still has a woman problem’Heather Binning, founder of the Women’s Rights Network, said: “Last night on Question Time, Keir Starmer was asked about comments he had previously made about Rosie Duffield’s position on sex and gender.“It was telling he chose to respond by saying he agreed with Tony Blair – a man. He could have said that despite his attempt to avoid a clear definition of ‘woman’ three years ago he of course understands the immutability of sex and the need to protect single-sex spaces.“The Labour Party isn’t alone in demonstrating that it still has a woman problem when it comes to the topic of sex and gender. Starmer should show some leadership: clarity on the importance of sex protects women and girls, which is surely not a vote loser.”In 2021 Sir Keir claimed it was “not right” to say that only women have a cervix amid a row involving Ms Duffield.In April 2023, the Labour leader then said that “99.9 per cent of women… haven’t got a penis”.Three months later, he changed his stance again, and said a woman is “an adult female”.On Question Time, Sir Keir said: “On the biology, I agree with what Tony Blair said in relation to men having penises and women having vaginas.”‘We lost sight of people’However, in a seeming criticism of activists who do not believe in trans ideology, he added: “I was worried by the way in which the debate was being conducted: it got very toxic… and we lost sight of people in that.”Dr Nicola Williams, director of Fair Play For Women, said in response: “The way Keir Starmer has dismissed women’s sex-based rights as ‘toxic’ and his failure to grasp the real-world harm done by defining ‘woman’ as an identity instead of a material reality, are a type of misogyny we increasingly see on the Left of politics.“They mean I couldn’t possibly vote for Labour. If he fails to understand that women’s rights depend on understanding what it means to be a woman then what else does he fail to understand?“If he is too cowardly to stand up to trans activists who prioritise the demands of trans-identifying men ahead of the needs of women, he doesn’t deserve to be prime minister.”Helen Joyce, director of advocacy at Sex Matters, said: “Protecting women in both everyday situations such as changing rooms and in specialist settings such as prisons and hospitals means recognising that there are just two sexes, and that no one can change sex.“Politicians of all parties have been confused and misled by the rhetoric of the trans lobby, which insists that how people identify matters more than their biology. Whoever forms the next government cannot keep ducking this issue.”On Friday, the Labour leader killed off Nicola Sturgeon’s gender self-ID law after he pledged that a UK government veto will remain in force if he becomes prime minister.On a visit to Scotland, the Labour leader was explicit that there would be no change in position from No 10 under his premiership, leaving no prospect of the legislation coming into force."
Yahoo News UK,"Who is Richard Tice? Reform’s former leader turned Farage sidekickThe candidate for Hartlepool has seen his party's popularity swell in recent months, with one poll showing reform ahead of the Conservatives.",[],Andrew Naughtie,Updated 14 June 2024 at 6:45 am·6-min read,14,June,2024,06:45:00,6,"Now that Nigel Farage has taken over as the leader of Reform UK, Richard Tice’s public profile is fading fast - but the Reform chairman remains involved in the party's operations.So far, the party has only one MP, Conservative defector Lee Anderson. But a recent poll has shown Reform overtaking the Tories, raising the possibility Anderson could hold his seat and even end up with fellow Reformers in the next Parliament.As the candidate for Hartlepool, where he stood as the Brexit Party candidate in 2019, Tice hopes to be one of them. So who is he, and what does he stand for?Childhood and educationBorn in Surrey in 1964 to James Tice, a showjumper, and Joan Tice, a horse trainer. Educated at the private boarding school Uppingham, he studied at the University of Salford, gaining a degree in construction economics and quantity surveying – teeing him up for a career that he said would ""continue the family genes in the property industry"".Family (partner & kids)Tice has three children from a 24-year marriage that ended in divorce. He is now in a long-term relationship with the right-wing writer and journalist Isabel Oakeshott.She is perhaps best known for two notorious incidents that set her against leading Tories: a book that featured the heavily disputed allegation that David Cameron had engaged in sexual activity with a pig, and the release of embarrassing messages entrusted to her by Matt Hancock when she agreed to write a book with him.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election? Full list mappedThe key issues that will decide the electionWhen is the first UK general election TV debate?What is purdah? The strict rule that governs what politicians can and can't sayNet worthWhile not quite in the same league as Rishi Sunak, Tice is one of the wealthiest people in British politics. As he describes it on his website, he made his multi-million-pound fortune over the course of “30 years of making things happen in property investment”, starting with a graduate job at a London firm in 1987.According to Tice, the company he leads as CEO, Quidnet Capital, has “bought and managed £500 million in commercial properties across the UK on behalf of clients”.He was also a key figure in the redevelopment of London’s Nine Elms district, near Battersea Power Station, a controversial project that has transformed a stretch of the Thames’s south bank with a welter of rapidly erected high-rise blocks.GB News linksAlong with Nigel Farage, Lee Anderson and several MPs on the right flank of the Tory party, Tice is a regular on the hard-right, culture war-focused TV outlet GB News. There he hosts a programme called “Richard Tice’s Sunday Sermon”, which serves as a platform for him to deliver his political analysis without the interruptions of an interviewer.However, despite the network being a relatively safe space for him in ideological terms, Tice’s appearances aren’t always amicable. A recent interview with host Andrew Pierce, a longtime right-wing commentator, saw him challenged fiercely about Reform’s chances in a summer election should one be called – with Pierce pointing to the “weirdos” selected by the party to fight numerous seats as evidence the party is “not ready”.Richard Tice, pictured in 2018 at a 'Leave Means Leave' campaign event, is focused on the issue of immigration. (Steve Finn/WENN)Tice was also involved in an incident that saw the network deemed in breach of broadcasting regulator Ofcom’s impartiality regulations, specifically an interview in which a former Brexit Party MEP failed to “sufficiently challenge” his views on immigration.The regulator is under increasing pressure to crack down on GB News heading into the election, with critics arguing it cannot be allowed to broadcast shows that feature Tory and Reform MPs interviewing each other without alternative points of view represented.Tice on NHSThe state and future of the NHS set to be one of this election’s main battlegrounds, and Reform’s key health policy is to spend £17 billion on the NHS on top of its current budget in an effort to get waiting lists down to zero. It also proposes introducing tax relief on private healthcare – something that has been criticised by opponents as a creeping step towards the privatisation of healthcare writ large.Tice’s stated rationale is that the reason the service is struggling is because the money it needs is being spent on other things that the public do not in fact support. Top of the list is Net Zero, which the party and its predecessors have long decried as a pointless “woke” project.In April, Tice used a press conference to frame the choice starkly. “We have a choice in this country, it seems to me,” he said. “A pretty clear choice. Do we want zero waiting lists in two years, and to keep them there? That is the Reform choice. Or do we want net zero CO2 emissions in 25 years? That is the Labour choice.”Tice on immigrationImmigration is by far Reform UK’s top issue, with the party looking to build on Farage’s two decades of campaigning against it in its legal and illegal forms.As far as the election goes, Tice and the party are targeting the continuing arrival of small boats of people travelling across the English Channel, many of them seeking asylum. He has criticised the government for failing to stop “mass immigration” post-Brexit, and described Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda policy as “a disaster”, arguing on GB News that its supposed deterrent value was revealed to be zero just hours after the House of Commons finally passed the law.Reform chairman Richard Tice (L) and leader Nigel Farage speak at the party's economic policy launch at Church House in London. (Alamy Live News)“Within a matter of hours more boats, absolutely packed full, overfilled with illegal migrants, were setting off from the beaches. And we learnt on Tuesday morning that sadly five people, including a young child, drowned leaving the beaches. That's not a deterrent. That's an absolute disaster.”Instead of deporting people to Rwanda, he is arguing for a “pick up and take back” policy that would see small boat arrivals deposited back on French soil. As evidence that this is both practical and humane, he has cited similar policies deployed in the US and Australia.However, he has not addressed the fact that Australia’s policy has been criticised internationally for leaving so-called “boat people” confined to facilities on the island of Nauru, where there have been incidents of suicide and self-immolation.Tice on cost of living crisisPerhaps unsurprisingly given he is trying to peel away former Tory voters, Tice has criticised recent Tory prime ministers harshly for overseeing Britain’s intense cost of living crisis. In 2022, he accused then-prime minister Boris Johnson of “waffling” over the situation. “Clueless, out of touch, no ideas, no help,” he tweeted. “Shocking.”He has also warned that the prospect of a “disastrous” Labour government will offer no prospect of meaningful relief for struggling households.Instead, Reform proposes lifting the minimum level of income tax to £20,000 while cutting various other taxes – among them fuel duty, another gesture to the party’s rejection of environmentalism as a top priority."

(image supplied)If there’s one issue that won’t be in the front of 18-year-old Ella Speers’ mind when she casts her first vote in a general election on 4 July, it’s Brexit. “It was half my lifetime ago and it was a very distant thing in the past,” says the A’ Level student, fresh out of one of her final exams and with her last long summer before adult independence on the horizon.“We’re not part of the EU anymore and we’ve known we’re not going to be part of the EU for almost a decade now. I don’t think there’s any benefit in looking back. I think it’s up to the leaders of this country to find their own solution to this now.”Speers says she feels frustrated when she sees some politicians blaming the economic issues the country faces now on Brexit when there’s no quick way to reverse that decision. She wants to hear more about the issues that she feels directly affect her life now - and that includes both the cost of living and climate change. “I’d quite like the world to still be intact by the time I’m 30,” she says gravely.Speers, who will be voting in David Cameron’s former constituency of Witney and West Oxfordshire, says she is still to make a final decision on how she will vote. She’s in a Conservative stronghold where the only possible rival to the Tory candidate is the Liberal Democrat challenger, but she is also tempted by the Green Party.“The Green Party have the best environmental policies, but the Lib Dems are also good on that and have policies that they have actually acted on in the past. And the Lib Dem candidate in my constituency has a background in environmental economics,” she says.But like many young people, Speers still feels that the Liberal Democrats cannot be trusted with their promises to the youth vote after compromising on scrapping tuition fees and other core promises when the party entered coalition with the Tories. “The last time the Lib Dems did well in an election was in 2010 and it didn’t go well in the long term,” she says. “I don’t know how they would fare in a position of power. That’s my biggest issue with politics: they all make promises they can never live up to.”Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

Reform’s former leader turned Farage sidekickKnowing she’s a new and floating voter, Speers - who signed up to ensure she received both the Green and Liberal Democrat manifestos when they were published - has been targeted by both parties with lots of marketing information, including requests for donations. She hasn’t felt plugged into the election campaign, but admits she avoids broadcast news and newspapers, obtaining most of her news updates through Instagram, and describes herself as “quite a sceptic” about what she reads and hears.In September, Speers will move to Surrey to study for a degree in acting. The cost of living, including energy bills, which she will soon pay independently, weighs on her mind as she prepares to move out of her family home for the first time. “I’ve managed to find a really good deal for rent but it’s still a lot [of money] and I’m looking at doing a course with 35 hours a week of contact time and still looking for paid work around that, even though I will have line learning and essays I have to write on top,” she explains. “When you look at the profits that the oil and fuel companies are making, there has to be a lot of deception in the communication [about the cost of living]. If it’s getting better I’ve yet to see that.”Other important policy issues for her include immigration - she describes the Rwanda policy, designed by the Conservative government to deport illegal migrants to the country, as “upsetting” - and what she perceives as a rolling back of rights for LGBT+ people under the Tories’ so-called ‘war on woke’. Speers says: “It’s overturning significant amounts of progress that has been made already. I don’t see why as a country we should be taking back those rights.”Speers, who describes herself as a pacifist, is also concerned about the lack of discussion in this campaign about our engagement with the Israel-Palestine conflict and the treatment of refugees in the Gaza Strip. “Lots of the news says things like ‘individuals were targeted’ and so much of it diminishes the effect of what’s happening in Gaza. They don’t go into anywhere near enough detail. The world leaders in the West either refrain from speaking or are still endorsing what is essentially a genocide. Our leaders need to be willing to stand up and report what is right.”Even though Speers is taking her first vote seriously, she warns that many of her college friends are not planning to vote because they believe it will not make any difference in such a long-standing Tory stronghold. “A lot of us know how our parents are going to vote. I’ve got quite a few friends whose parents are very right-wing while their children are left-wing. They just think they’ll be outnumbered so what’s the point,” she says. “But for me it’s a big step towards adulthood and independence. If I’ve made the effort to make my voice heard then I have the right to complain.”Read more:'I’ve always voted Labour, but this time around I'm with Rishi''Westminster ignores the plight of farmers like me – I don't know who I'll vote for''The health service isn't working, education isn't working – that's why I'm voting Labour''Why I’m voting tactically in the general election'"

Many also assume his title is hereditary.So what do you really need to know about the man who, on current poll ratings, is set to be the UK’s next prime minister?His early lifeKeir Starmer was born in Southwark, south London, in 1962, as the second of four children. His parents were Labour Party members and named him after Keir Hardie, the party’s first leader in parliament.The family moved out of the capital and he grew up in Hurst Green, a village just outside the small Surrey town of Oxted. He was active in youth politics from his teenage years but was also a skilled musician, taking music lessons alongside Norman Cook, who later became better known as a member of The Housemartins and the DJ Fatboy Slim.Starmer played the flute, piano, violin and recorder and was a junior exhibitioner at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.His familyStarmer is married to Victoria, a former solicitor who later retrained in occupational health and now works for the NHS. The pair met through their work in the law in the early 2000s and married in Essex in 2007.She was first seen accompanying her husband when the couple were filmed clapping for carers during the pandemic in 2020 outside their home in Camden. They have two children, a son and daughter, but both are kept out of the public eye.Victoria's father was Jewish and originally came from Poland, while her mother converted when they got married. Starmer has said in a previous interview that ""my wife in particular wants our children to know the faith of her family"" and that they ""observe some of the practices, for example Friday night prayers"".Keir Starmer with parents, Rodney and Josephine, at his graduation. (Twitter/Keir Starmer)His parentsThe Labour leader's father, Rodney Starmer, worked as a toolmaker in a factory, and his mother Josephine Starmer (née Baker), was a nurse.His father worked long, 14-hour days but spent his time outside work caring for Josephine, who was diagnosed with the autoimmune condition Still’s disease. She required two hip and knee replacements twice in her lifetime and struggled with arthritic pain.As a young man Starmer also helped care for his mother, which he has said led to him being more emotionally reserved. His sister, Katy, recalled: “He’s had to be a grown-up all his life. I’ve always been quite open about my feelings – Keir is good at most things, but not that.” Josephine Starmer died in 2015, and his father three years later.His educationStarmer passed the 11-plus examination, and attended Reigate Grammar School from age 11. While he was at the school it became an independent fee-paying institution, but as an existing student he was exempt from fees, and his tuition in the sixth form was covered by a bursary.After school he studied law at the University of Leeds, this first in his family to attend university, graduating with a first class degree in 1985. He undertook postgraduate law studied at the University of Oxford, where he served as editor of a radical magazine, Socialist Alternatives.A photograph of a younger Starmer as shown on ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories in 2021. (ITV)Why is he a sir?Stamer was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 2014 in recognition of his work in the legal profession, culminating in a five-year term as Director of Public Prosecutions.He first became a barrister in 1987 at the Middle Temple, later joining Doughty Street Chambers and was appointed a Queen’s Counsel in 2002, aged just 39. In 2008 he was appointed head of the Crown Prosecution Service and DPP.During his tenure he chose to prosecute three Labour MPs and a Conservative in the wake of the parliamentary expenses scandal, and was responsible for prosecuting former MP Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce for perverting the course of justice after Pryce claimed responsibility for her former husband’s speeding offence.Starmer on... the NHSThe Labour leader has said that, if elected, his government would “get the NHS working around the clock and pay staff properly to do it”.The remark followed a commitment to provide £1.1bn in funding for the health service to cut waiting lists by paying doctors and nurses to carry out additional out-of-hours care, which would be funded by axing tax breaks for wealthy “non-doms” who hoard money overseas. He added: “The Conservative Party that brought our NHS to its knees will put it in the ground. We have to get it back on its feet.”Starmer describes the NHS as “the crowdfunded solution for all of us”, reinforcing his commitment to healthcare being free at the point of use, but says reform is inevitable or the health service would “remain on life support”. He has pledged to integrate up-to-date technology into every part of the NHS including using artificial intelligence to diagnose disease earlier and more accurately.He supported the doctors strikes, telling ministers: “Don’t break junior doctors, talk to them. Get in the room [and] sort it out.”Starmer with his wife, Lady Victoria Starmer, at the Labour Party Conference in October 2023. (Alamy)Starmer on… immigrationThe government has “lost control of borders”, according to Labour. Starmer has said a Labour government would set up a new policy unit to tackle illegal migration and has suggested that a returns agreement for asylum seekers could be negotiated with the European Union to solve the small boats crisis.He described the government’s thwarted Rwanda plan, which would see illegal migrants deported to the African nation but has to be put into practice due to legal blocks, as a “gimmick” and a “farce” and has promised to reverse it.Starmer on... the cost of living crisisStarmer has sought to keep Rishi Sunak’s handling of the cost of living crisis in the minds of voters by claiming that “his fingerprints are all over their struggling household budgets”. In a letter to his shadow cabinet, leaked to The Guardian, he wrote: “Rishi Sunak is the chief architect of choices prioritising the wealthiest and of the government’s failure to get a grip of the economy and get growth going.”He has said he would prioritise tackling inflation, blaming it for putting up prices and eroding household savings, but has pledged to “take the difficult and responsible decisions” to bring it down.Starmer pictured in 2010, when he was director of public prosecution at the CPS, making a statement about MPs who face charges over their expenses claims. (Getty)Starmer on... private schoolsLabour has dropped its early promise to scrap charitable status for private schools, but has committed to levying a 20% VAT rate on school fees removing their “unfair tax break”. The money raised, he said, will be used to address the “appalling state” of the school system for all children.“It’s not an attack on private schools. It’s just saying an exemption you have had is going to go,” he warned private schools who have been critical of the plan – reminding them they are not obliged to pass that tax on to parents in the form of increased fees.Starmer on… the House of LordsWhen he was first Labour leader, Starmer proposed a “root and branch reform of the centre of government… rooting out unearned privilege and addressing unaccountable power”.But his promise to scrap the House of Lords within the first four years of a new parliament - a controversial move that caused a split among his party’s grandees, has been abandoned.Starmer still backs plans for a second chamber “electoral legitimacy”, but as his party nears government he has stepped away from the most radical form of that pledge. He is now reportedly committed to cutting the number of hereditary peers, reducing the size of the chamber and introducing a new appointments process."

The term is also sometimes used to refer to the election itself, as in ‘they could not win at the ballot box’.CampaignThe time before an election in which politicians persuade people to vote for them. In the case of the 2024 election in the UK, parliament was dissolved on the 30 May and the election will take place on 4 July.CanvassingGoing round a particular area trying to persuade people to vote for one party or the other.In UK elections, this is often done by volunteers knocking on people’s doors.Capital gains taxCapital gains tax is a tax on profit when people sell assets that have increased in value.In the 2024 election, the Conservatives have promised that landlords who sell to sitting tenants will be spared capital gains tax on the proceeds, while Labour has left the door open to raising capital gains.Child benefitChild benefit is a benefit paid to parents with children under 16 (or under 20 in approved education or training).The Conservatives have promised to increase the threshold at which high earners start to lose the benefit from £60,000 to £120,000.Sir Keir Starmer, like the Conservatives, has pledged not to raise VAT.

For example, both the 2010 election and 2017 elections resulted in hung parliament.In 2010, the Conservatives formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, while in 2017, the Conservatives formed a minority government with a 'confidence and supply' agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).Income tax thresholdThe thresholds between the tax-free allowance, basic rate tax and higher rates of tax.Both parties have said they will continue the freeze on income tax thresholds brought in under the Conservatives, which means people pay more tax as more and more people are pushed into higher tax brackets if wages rise.MajorityA party with a majority – more than half of the seats in the House of Commons – has won the election.The number of votes by which an individual MP wins a constituency is also referred to as their majority.ManifestoPolitical parties publish manifestos before a general election, with a set of policies that the party stands for and aims to implement if elected.Manifesto pledges are not legally binding.Marginal seatA seat in which the incumbent MP won by a small majority, meaning a swing is more likely than in a so-called ‘safe seat’ where the MP had a large majority.Net zeroThe UK Government has set a goal for Britain’s emissions to reach net zero – where emission and removal of greenhouse gases reaches equilibrium – by 2050.All major parties are expected to stick to this goal, barring Reform UK.Opinion pollAn opinion poll is a research survey (usually carried out on a representative sample of the electorate) to gauge likely results in an election.Poll‘The polls’ refers to the places where people vote in an election: exit polls and opinion polls refer to two kinds of survey used to predict election results.Postal voteAn absentee vote where the vote is sent in by post.At the 2019 general election, 17.2% of voters across the UK used a postal ballot.Proxy voteA vote where a person who can’t make it to the booth appoints someone to vote for them.In the 2019 election, 0.6% of voters appointed a proxy.PsephologyPsephology is the scientific study of elections and voting and is used to predict and analyse election results.Polling dayThe day when the country places their vote: in the UK 2024 election, this is July 4.PurdahBefore British elections, the country enters purdah, officially known as the ‘pre-election period of sensitivity’.Purdah means that politicians (both local and national) and other people such as civil servants face restrictions on what they can do and announce.Ministers who remain in office can’t announce new funding, or new policies, or anything which might sway voters or make the government more popular.The idea is that public money cannot be spent on the election.Spoiled ballotA ballot paper which has been marked wrongly (for instance with a vote for more than one candidate) will not be counted.Sometimes people spoil ballots deliberately as a protest vote to show dissatisfactionSwing‘Swing’ is the change in voter support for a political party between one election and the next.It is used to analyse the performance of parties in different areas.Tax burdenThe tax burden refers to the total amount of taxes paid by a group (in this case the UK as a whole) as a proportion of total income.The tax burden is currently at its highest in 70 years according to the OECD.The Equality ActThe 2010 Equality Act protects people against discrimination in Britain.The Conservatives want to ‘tweak’ the Act so that sex-based protections only apply on the basis of someone’s biological sex.Triple lockThe triple lock is a guarantee introduced to the state pension in 2010 so it would not lose value in real terms.The guarantee means that the state pension will rise by the highest out of average earnings, inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) or 2.5%.Triple lock plusThe ‘triple lock plus’ is a Conservative policy, which would see the tax-free pension allowance rise every year in line with the triple lock of average wages, inflation, or 2.5% – whichever is highest, to prevent pensioners being pulled into paying income tax.TurnoutTurnout refers to the percentage of people eligible to vote who turn out to vote on election day.In the 2019 election, for example, 67.3% of those eligible turned out to vote.VATValue added tax is added to goods and services sold by VAT-registered companies, and is the third-largest source of government income after income tax and national insurance.Both Labour and the Conservatives have pledged not to raise VAT.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

Yahoo News UK,"Will Nigel Farage's Reform UK 'beat' the Tories in the election?With some polling figures putting the Tories and Reform UK nearly neck and neck, could Farage's party really end up with nearly as many MPs as Sunak's?","['What do the latest polls say?', 'Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?', 'Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?', 'What is proportional representation?']",James Cheng-Morris and  Ellen Manning,Updated 14 June 2024 at 6:33 am·7-min read,14,June,2024,06:33:00,7,"Leading pollster John Curtice has poured cold water on suggestions that Reform UK is now beating the Conservative Party in the general election polls.As representatives from seven parties took prepared to take part in a TV debate on Thursday, a YouGov survey for The Times newspaper said Reform’s support had increased by two points to 19%, putting them ahead of the Tories for the first time.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage took the the opportunity to hail the poll results in the debate, declaring: “We are now the opposition to Labour.”But Curtice urged caution, insisting that single polls should not be relied on. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""This is one poll - we’ve actually, I think, had four other polls published in the last 24 hours - none of which have had Reform ahead, not even all of which have had Reform gaining ground, but quite a couple of them certainly suggesting it’s also got very close.""He said it may not be the case that Reform are ahead - and could be on average four or five points behind. But he said: ""This is still bad news for the Conservatives. The only way Rishi Sunak can hope to get even to base camp in narrowing the lead that Labour have started off with this campaign was to squeeze the Reform vote.""He added: ""Rather than making progress, things are actually going backwards, not least of course because of Nigel Farage’s decision to fight this campaign.""With many speculating that Reform UK with Farage at the helm could ""beat"" the Tories, Yahoo News UK takes a look.What do the latest polls say?YouGov’s voting intention tracker, updated on Tuesday, suggests the Tories and Reform UK are neck and neck.With Labour well ahead on 38%, the Tories are trailing on 18% – compared to a high of 53% under Boris Johnson in 2020 – with Reform UK just behind on 17% and the Liberal Democrats on 15%.However, there are multiple polls taking place at any one time by a number of different companies.According to the PA news agency, an average of all polls that were carried out wholly or partly during the seven days to June 13 puts Labour on 43%, 21 points ahead of the Conservatives on 22%, followed by Reform on 14%, the Lib Dems on 10% and the Greens on 6%.And while Reform’s average is up one percentage point on the figure for the previous week and the Tories are down one point, there is still an eight-point gap, on average, between the two.Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?Unless something remarkable happens, in short: 'No' - and that's because of the first past the post (FPTP) voting system in which the candidate with the largest number of votes in their constituency is elected.According to the Electoral Reform Society, which is against FPTP, this system leads to a situation where “even if millions of voters support the same party, if they are thinly spread out across the UK they may only get the largest number of votes in a couple of these contests – so only win a few MPs"".“Tens of thousands of voters supporting a different party, but who live near each other, could end up with more MPs. This means the number of MPs a party has in parliament rarely matches their popularity with the public.”Rishi Sunak on the campaign trail on Wednesday. (AFP via Getty Images)Farage knows this well. As the leader of UKIP in the 2015 election, he saw his party win 12.6% of the nationwide vote and one seat. The Liberal Democrats won 7.9% of the vote... and eight seats.Indeed, YouGov last week released a poll – put together using the multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) surveying technique, from a sample size of nearly 60,000 respondents – which suggested the Tories would win just 140 seats, having won 365 in 2019. But this is still 140 more than the zero it projected Reform UK to win, in spite of its strong polling figures.The model had Reform UK ""performing strongly in a number of seats but still a long way off winning in any"", with projected second-placed finishes in 27 constituencies.YouGov's MRP projection. (YouGov)Granted, this model was formed between 24 May and 1 June, before Farage's headline-grabbing intervention on Monday last week in which he announced he would be standing as an MP.But, even as Reform UK polls closer than ever to the Tories, it's difficult to imagine the party winning more than a handful of seats.Chris Hopkins, director at polling firm Savanta, told Yahoo News UK that in one respect, Reform UK is at an advantage compared to Ukip in 2015 because ""Ukip took votes from both Labour and the Conservatives, and we are not seeing that with Reform UK – they are all coming from the Conservatives.""That is the consequence of Rishi Sunak making immigration a centrepiece of the campaign and failing to deliver on it. Even if you have voters that are neutral on immigration, they would say the small boats policy has been a disaster.""But even so, Hopkins said, Reform UK is still ""at a huge electoral disadvantage"" in that its votes are not very concentrated, they are very evenly spread.""There are going to be some races where Reform UK is strong - the Nigel Farage factor in Clacton is really interesting - but realistically its ceiling is five seats: and that’s a high ceiling.""Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey on a campaign visit in Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire, on Wednesday. (PA)Like Reform UK, Sir Ed Davey’s Liberal Democrats are performing well in the polls.In a sign of how defensive the Tory campaign is becoming, one online party advert claims voting for Reform UK or the Lib Dems could give Labour 100 extra seats, resulting in the biggest majority in its history.It depicts a scenario where the Conservatives are beaten into third place behind the Lib Dems, with just 57 seats, despite getting 19% of the vote and without Reform winning a single seat.Read more: Pollsters got it wrong in 2015, so could Labour’s lead be overestimated? (The Guardian)However, it remains unlikely the Lib Dems will finish second. YouGov’s MRP poll projected the party performing strongly, winning 48 seats. This would be up 37 from 2019, but still nowhere near the Tories’ projected 140.However, amid all this talk about projections, it’s worth remembering they are still only polls and not a definite indicator of how people will vote on 4 July. The 1992 and 2015 elections are notable examples of how polling didn’t match the end results of Tory wins.What is proportional representation?Proportional representation, as defined by the UK parliament, is an electoral system ""in which the distribution of seats corresponds closely with the proportion of the total votes cast for each party. For example, if a party gained 40% of the total votes, a perfectly proportional system would allow them to gain 40% of the seats.""This differs from the first past the post system, as set out above, in that a relatively high vote share rarely corresponds with increased seats for the smaller parties. In 2019, for example, the Lib Dems won 11.5% of the vote but only 1.7% – 11 – of the 650 seats.Unsurprisingly, both Reform UK and the Lib Dems support proportional representation.The Lib Dems this week made it part of their manifesto, with the party saying it would introduce the single transferrable vote method, a form of proportional representation which allows electors to rank their preference of candidates on the ballot.The party previously sought to change the UK’s voting system while in the coalition government under then-leader Nick Clegg, but voters rejected the plan in a 2011 referendum.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

Yahoo News UK,Who will win the next general election?

All the polls use the multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP) technique, which enables projections to be made at constituency level.And while all three polls indicate Sunak faces an uphill battle to avoid a major defeat, there is a significant disparity from all three as to how far ahead Keir Starmer actually is.Yahoo summaries the key points of the three pollsTories to slump to lowest number of seats since party's formationYouGov's polling for Sky News projects Labour is on course to achieve a 200-seat majority. Labour is predicted to secure 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.This projection would show the Tories plummeting from the 365 won by Boris Johnson in the 2019 election and give the party their lowest ever number of MPs. It would also give Starmer more seats than the 418 won by Tony Blair in 1997.

Given the nature of these seat totals, it is natural to be slightly sceptical.""It adds: ""Not every MRP is the same. The statistical 'building blocks' used to model voter behaviour will vary from pollster to pollster, which will in turn lead to different vote shares and seat totals. All different pollsters will get different national vote share.""The MRP methodology, as described by YouGov, ""uses data at the constituency level to predict the outcomes of seats based on the concentration of various different types of voters who live there"".Stuart Wilks-Heeg, writing in The Conversation earlier this month, points out some of the other limitations of MRP polling: ""There are ... factors MRPs cannot take into account. Some constituency results will be influenced by locally specific issues that statistical models can’t capture. For example, adjustments cannot be made for who the candidates are in each constituency and whether any have a profile that could enhance, or detract from, their party’s chance of winning. Think Nigel Farage standing for Reform UK in Clacton.""And competing MRPs produce contrasting outcomes because each model uses specific assumptions and data. Different inputs produce different outputs. This election has seen more MRPs produced than ever before, and from various organisations. In the early hours of July 5, we’ll know which one came closest to getting the result correct.""What are the latest odds?As of 19 June, Oddschecker – a website which compares odds across different bookmakers – had Labour at 1/41 to win the most seats. To put that in context, this is seen as so likely that a £10 bet would return just £10.24.The Conservatives are 40/1 to win the most seats, a scenario seen as so unlikely that a £10 punt would return £410.What went wrong for the Tories?YouGov's voting intention tracker between January 2020 and June 2024. (YouGov)So, why have the polls changed so dramatically? It's worth looking back on an extremely eventful four-and-a-half years in UK politics.According to YouGov's voting intention tracker (see chart, above), Tory support peaked at 53%, with Labour on 32%, in April 2020, months after the party's stunning success in the 2019 general election and Boris Johnson's pledge to “get Brexit done”. That month also saw Starmer take over as Labour leader from Jeremy Corbyn.This was also amid a spirit of national unity following the onset of the COVID pandemic which nearly killed Johnson himself. The then-PM had been released from hospital five days before this particular survey was taken.Boris Johnson delivers his final speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street in September 2022. (AFP via Getty Images)Over the rest of the year, there was a downturn in support amid chaos over COVID rules, with the Tories falling as low as 35% in November 2020, compared to Labour on 40%.However, the UK’s successful COVID vaccination programme provided a pathway out of lockdown and with it, improved poll ratings. Tory support peaked at 41% in June 2021, with Labour at 30%.In October that year, there was a sense Johnson was untouchable. At the Tory party conference, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg remarked how the PM was ""in total command of his party, and politically dominant in the country"".But this fell apart quickly with the Partygate scandal, which emerged in November that year. Time and again, reports emerged of government and Tory staff – including Johnson – having taken part in lockdown-era social gatherings when their own COVID rules had prohibited them.By January 2022, Tory support had plummeted to 28%, with Labour on 38%. Johnson struggled on, but never recovered and a wave of ministerial resignations forced him to resign in July that year.The UK had three separate prime ministers – Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak – between 6 September and 24 October, 2022. (Getty Images)His successor, Liz Truss, then embarked on arguably the most disastrous prime ministerial reign in history, characterised by the catastrophic ""mini-budget"", containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, which prompted an economic crisis. Like Johnson, she lost the confidence of Tory MPs – and voters – and had to resign.Her 49-day spell as PM was the shortest in history, with Tory support plummeting to 19% (with Labour on 56%) the day after she announced her resignation in October 2022.Rishi Sunak, who had lost to Truss in the previous month's Tory leadership election, took over. However, as the above YouGov chart indicates, he has failed to cut through with voters. Tory support was at 23% two days after he assumed office, with the most recent survey, carried out on Thursday, showing support is now lower than under Truss at 18%.In short, the polls and odds, not to mention other factors such as notable by-election victories for Starmer's Labour, are pointing to a Labour government next month.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

Yahoo News UK,"Three important UK election issues, explainedRishi Sunak said his leadership is needed in 'uncertain' times. Keir Starmer said the country needs to be 'rebuilt'. So what issues do voters care about most?","['The economy', 'Health', 'Immigration and asylum']",James Cheng-Morris,Updated 28 May 2024 at 11:11 am·5-min read,28,May,2024,11:11:00,5,"After months of speculation, Rishi Sunak confirmed the general election will be held on 4 July.The prime minister said Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer could not be trusted to lead the country through “uncertain” times. He made the economy and combating global security the key elements of his pitch to the nation as he announced the election date.In response, Starmer told voters: “Together we can stop the chaos, we can turn the page, we can start to rebuild Britain.”But amid this “uncertainty” and need to “rebuild”, what do the voters consider the key issues?This chart, produced using YouGov polling over the course of this parliament, offers an insight in the issues voters care most about and how that has ebbed and flowed over time.Compared to when Boris Johnson's Tories won the December 2019 poll, the economy, immigration, defence and tax have grown in importance in the eyes of the electorate. This has come amid the cost of living crisis; small boats crossing the English Channel; the onset of the Ukraine war and wider global instability; and the highest tax burden in 70 years.Housing has also become a bigger concern, with the Renters Reform Bill - in which the government pledged to scrap no-fault evictions - having been paused after Sunak called the election.Meanwhile, the last general election was fought - and won by the Tories - on a single issue: Brexit. Yet the chart shows a clear downturn in its relevance among voters, particularly after a trade deal was agreed with the EU in December 2020.This next chart, meanwhile, highlights what voters have considered the top issues over the past year. By a wide margin, the top three are the economy, health and immigration and asylum.Here, Yahoo News UK breaks down what is behind these issues and how they have ebbed and flowed in importance among voters since the last election in 2019.The economyThe unprecedented lockdown called by Boris Johnson in March 2020 meant the public’s attention shifted to the economy, as demonstrated by the huge spike in the chart above. The then-chancellor Rishi Sunak was forced to implement a £70bn furlough scheme, lasting 18 months, to protect people’s jobs.There was a second almighty economic shock - and rise in public concern - in February 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This caused a further spike in an already turbulent wholesale energy market, driving up costs for suppliers and ultimately customers.Average energy bills eventually reached £2,500 a year (and would have exceeded £4,000 had the government not intervened). This was double the £1,278 consumers were paying before the war and by the time this election takes place, people will still be paying much more than this: £1,568.Energy prices were also a key driver in inflation reaching 11.1% - a 41-year high - by October 2022, though it has since fallen to 2.3%, which is near the Bank of England’s 2.0% target.The third economic shock of this parliament - and most damaging for the Tories - was in October 2022 when Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng's disastrous “mini budget”, containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, prompted an economic crisis. It led to soaring interest rates, and to this day homeowners who are remortgaging are facing significantly higher bills.HealthHealth, like the economy, is another issue which clearly correlated with the beginning of the pandemic. The above chart shows an enormous spike in public concern when COVID cases started to multiply in March 2020, ultimately leading to the nationwide lockdown as the NHS faced collapse.Cases fell that summer, but spikes in the chart can be seen once infections rose again and fresh nationwide lockdowns were imposed in October 2020 and January 2021. By March 2022, likely as concerns over the Omicron variant faded, there was much less concern about health.In January last year, there was a brief spike as the NHS in England experienced the biggest industrial action in its history, with tens of thousands of nurses and ambulance staff walking out simultaneously.As for the state of play going into the election, NHS waiting lists remain higher than they were when Sunak vowed to cut them last year. According to the latest figures, an estimated 7.54 million treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of March, relating to 6.29 million patients.Immigration and asylumSince the last election, the immigration and asylum narrative has largely revolved around one issue: small boats crossing the English Channel.The numbers have risen in most of the intervening years: there were 1,843 crossings in 2019, 8,466 in 2020, 28,526 in 2021, 45,774 in 2022 and 29,437 last year. This year, the number has already passed the 10,000 mark.The regular sharp spikes in the above chart demonstrate how frequently crossings have been in the news, including some occasions when hundreds of migrants have made the dangerous journey in a single day.But it also reflects how the government has made this part of its own agenda. It was Boris Johnson’s government which first announced plans to deport migrants to Rwanda in April 2022. That policy was picked up by Rishi Sunak when he became prime minister in October that year, with Sunak since repeating his pledge to “stop the boats”.But after calling the election, Sunak admitted this week that flights would not take off before the country goes to the polls.Read moreFive important laws that could be dropped due to Sunak's snap election (Yahoo News UK)OPINION - Rishi Sunak has been in last-ditch campaign mode for so long — a General Election is logical (Evening Standard)Door open for Boris Johnson to campaign for Tories, Rishi Sunak signals (PA Media)"
Yahoo News UK,The Tory ministers and 'big beasts' who could lose MP seats in the electionSeveral big names in the Conservative Party are at risk of losing their seats in the general election.,"['Grant Shapps', 'Penny Mordaunt', 'Liz Truss', 'Jacob Rees-Mogg', 'Johnny Mercer', 'Victoria Prentis', 'Alex Chalk', 'David TC Davies']",Andy Wells,Updated 20 June 2024 at 3:51 am·5-min read,20,June,2024,03:51:00,5,"Rishi Sunak could become the first prime minister to lose his seat in a general election, according to new bombshell polling.According to the Savanta poll, which was commissioned by The Telegraph, the Conservatives are projected to win just 53 seats in the general election. Some three-quarters of the Cabinet would lose their seats in that scenario – including Sunak.Were Sunak to lose his seat in Richmond (Yorks), it would make him the first prime minister in history to lose their seat in a general election, according to the Institute for Government. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is also facing a battle to hold on to his constituency, with the vote on a “knife edge”.Savanta spoke to around 18,000 people between 7 June and 18 June for their poll. If reflected in the election, Labour would be on course to win 516 seats, with a commanding Commons majority of 382. The Liberal Democrats would have nearly as many seats (50) as the Tories.Jeremy Hunt: My constituency is on a knife edgeHunt could be among the Conservative casualties on the night of the 4 July poll, despite his newly-created seat in Godalming and Ash currently holding a Conservative majority of more than 10,000. He is facing a battle to win the seat in Surrey, with the Liberal Democrats keen on taking a high-profile scalp.Several other Tory ‘big beasts’ also face a tight vote to hold onto their seat, according to a major poll by Ipsos.Grant ShappsDefence secretary Grant Shapps may lose his seat in the election. (Getty)Defence secretary Grant Shapps, who had been touted as a potential leader of the Conservatives after the election, is at risk of losing his Welwyn Hatfield seat, according to Ipsos. Their polling suggests a likely Labour victory, with Sir Keir Starmer’s party currently on 48%, compared to 28% for the Conservatives.Shapps won the seat in the 2019 election with a vote share of 52.6%, increasing his majority from the previous election.Penny MordauntPenny Mordaunt’s seat is at risk from Labour. (PA)Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons, is another Tory MP whose name has been mentioned in a future leadership contest – in the event of the Tories losing the election. However, she may not even be an MP after 4 July as her Portsmouth North seat is at risk.Seen as “leaning Labour”, polling suggests Labour are on 42%, compared to the Tories on 34%.
