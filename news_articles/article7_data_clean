The Telegraph,How accurate are exit polls? The difficult business of predicting general election results,[],Lauren Shirreff,19 June 2024 at 2:27 am·3-min read,19,June,2024,02:27:00,3,"Rishi Sunak has fired the starting gun on a July general election, setting in motion a few frenzied weeks of campaigning before people go to the polls for the first national vote since 2019.The last stage before that final verdict will be the exit poll, which offers a unique window on the outcome – and the 10pm ballot does have an impressive track record.Prof Sir John Curtice, who leads the team that crunches the numbers broadcast to the nation as the polls close, says that its recent history makes the forecast worthy of close attention.“The record isn’t perfect, but since 2005 the exit poll has given a pretty good indication of where the result will end up on the night. It also tends to be more accurate than opinion polls carried out before voting happens,” he says.Poll tracker: Conservatives falling as general election loomsFollow The Telegraph’s general election live coverageThe exit poll is based on a small sample of voters from around 130 polling stations spread throughout the country.People at each station are approached at random by fieldworkers, who hand them a replica ballot. The voter then privately fills in the ballot to indicate how they voted and puts it into a box.“We use these replica ballots to make models that predict how constituencies will have voted,” Prof Curtice says.“The data we get from those ballots is compared against how people voted at the same polling station at the previous general election.“Crucially this shows the geography of how people’s votes have changed. From this, we make a series of equations that indicate who is likely to win each constituency. When you add up all these equations you arrive at your final forecast for the whole country,” he explains.The forecasts made for each constituency are also influenced by what is known about people who live there, for example how they voted in the 2016 EU referendum.A constituency’s physical location also informs the predictions made about it.“For example if a box of ballots comes from a northern seat, and there seems to be a rise in people voting Labour across the north, then the models are adjusted for that too,” Prof Curtice says.This all means that it can be harder to predict the result of a general election in more contentious years. The 2015 exit poll failed to predict a Conservative majority and instead suggested a hung parliament. But in other years the exit poll has predicted the winning party’s majority down to the exact number of seats.The 2023 boundary review means that the shape and size of a number of constituencies will change at the next general election. Prof Curtice is confident that this won’t throw the exit poll too far off the truth.“Where there are boundary changes we will be basing our equations on how a given constituency voted at the last election, rather than the polling station itself,” he explains.“This might slightly increase the chance that we’re wrong in our forecast for a particular constituency, but given all of the information we have about voters, I don’t think that this leaves a chance for errors on a systematic level.”"
The Telegraph,Starmer-backed group of Labour MPs proposed six tax rises worth £60bn,[],Timothy Sigsworth,19 June 2024 at 1:32 am·2-min read,19,June,2024,01:32:00,2,"A dossier drawn up by Labour MPs proposed six new tax rises to raise £60 billion.The proposals from the party’s Tribune group – of which Sir Keir Starmer is a member – set out increases to inheritance tax, capital gains taxes and a new “jackpot” levy on the super-rich.Under the plan, working pensioners would also be forced to pay national insurance (NI), council tax would be reformed which could double bills and the cap on NI would be removed.The document, seen by the Daily Mail, was submitted as part of discussions about what would go in Labour’s manifesto by the Tribune group of MPs, whose members also include David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, and Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary.Laura Trott, the Conservative Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said the proposals were “shocking”.“After spending the whole campaign failing to rule out these tax rises, it’s clear from this document that their plan all along has been to raise taxes across the board,” she said.“It’s now time for the Labour Party to come clean with the public: which taxes are they planning to raise?”But a Labour spokesman dismissed the claims, telling the Daily Mail that Sir Keir had “nothing to do with” the manifesto submission and that it was rejected at an early stage of manifesto deliberations.“None of this is Labour policy,” the spokesman said. “The Tories are the party of high taxes. Labour will ensure taxes on working people are as low as possible.”The Tribune manifesto submission said the six tax rises are “consistent” with Labour’s values but “do not represent specific policy positions”.The dossier proposes extending NI to all sources of income to raise a claimed £12 billion. Pension payments would be exempt but working pensioners’ salaries would not be.The cap on NI would also be removed. Currently, NI is paid at a rate of eight per cent on all earnings up to £50,268 and two per cent on income above that threshold. That rate would instead be increased to eight per cent, raising £20 billion.Capital gains tax would also be equalised with income tax rates to bring in £16 billion, while inheritance tax reliefs on farmland, business property and pension pots would be axed to raise £4 billion.Council tax rates would be reformed to become “fairer”, meaning rates in more expensive areas could double.Lastly, a “jackpot tax” on what the proposal deems “extreme wealth” would raise £10 billion a year.Labour’s manifesto contains proposals for tax rises worth a total of £8.6 billion.The party has insisted it will not raise income tax, National Insurance or VAT.But senior figures have refused to rule out raising capital gains tax or council tax, saying only that there are “no plans” to do so."

The Telegraph,The photo ID you need to vote in UK elections,"['What are the voter ID requirements?', 'What types of ID are accepted?', 'Do the rules apply to postal votes?', 'How can I get a voter ID card?', 'What if I do not have a valid ID?', 'Why was voter ID introduced?', 'Why is voter ID so controversial?']",Amy Gibbons,19 June 2024 at 2:12 am·5-min read,19,June,2024,02:12:00,5,"Since May 2023, voters across the UK have been asked to show a form of photographic ID at their local ballot box.The requirement draws on the recommendations of a 2016 report by Lord Pickles, the former communities secretary, which warned there was a risk of “significant abuse” in the electoral system if people could vote under false pretences with little risk of detection.As Labour continues to hold a lead of around 20 percentage points in the latest election opinion polls, The Telegraph sets out everything you need to know about voting rules ahead of the general election on July 4.Here are the acceptable forms of identification you can bring to vote for an election candidate. Follow The Telegraph’s general election live coverageWhat are the voter ID requirements?Everyone wanting to vote in the UK must produce photo ID to take part in certain elections.For voters in England, Scotland and Wales, this includes UK parliamentary elections, by-elections and recall petitions. Those in England also need their ID for local elections.The requirement does not apply to Holyrood, Senedd or council elections in Scotland and Wales. People in Northern Ireland already needed photo ID to vote, so the rule change does not affect them.Voters in both England and Wales also need ID for police and crime commissioner elections.The rule has been applied in stages, beginning with the local elections in England on May 4, 2023. This year’s general election will be the first time ID is required for a national poll.The change marks a significant departure from the previous system in most of the UK, where voters only had to verbally confirm their name and address.What types of ID are accepted?Voters are required to show one form of photo ID at the polls, and it does not need to be in date so long as it is recognisable as the person at the ballot box.However, it must be the original version – not a photocopy – and the name on the ID should be the same as it appears on the electoral register.Acceptable forms of voter ID include:Passport issued by the UK, any of the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, a British Overseas Territory, an EEA state or a Commonwealth country (including an Irish Passport Card)Full or provisional driving licence issued by the UK, any of the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, or an EEA stateA Blue BadgeAny identity card bearing the Pass (Proof of Age Standards Scheme) hologramAny of the following travel passes:Older person’s bus pass funded by the GovernmentDisabled person’s bus pass funded by the GovernmentOyster 60+ card funded by the GovernmentFreedom passScottish national entitlement card issued for the purpose of concessionary travel (including a 60+, disabled or under 22s bus pass)60 and over Welsh concessionary travel cardDisabled person’s Welsh concessionary travel cardSenior SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandRegistered blind SmartPass or blind person’s SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandWar disablement SmartPass issued in Northern Ireland60+ SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandHalf fare SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandAny of these government-issued documents:Biometric immigration documentMinistry of Defence Form 90 (Defence Identity Card)National identity card issued by an EEA stateElectoral identity card issued in Northern IrelandVoter authority certificateAnonymous elector’s documentDo the rules apply to postal votes?No. You do not need to have any form of photo ID to vote by post.However, you will be asked to provide your National Insurance (NI) number when you apply to verify your identity. If you are not able to do this, you will need to explain why.The deadline to apply for a postal vote is 5pm on Wednesday June 19 in England, Scotland and Wales, with Saturday June 15 the limit in Northern Ireland. You must also already be registered to vote.How can I get a voter ID card?You can apply for a free voter authority certificate (VAC) either online or by post. To complete an online application, you will need a recent, digital photo of yourself and your NI number.You can still apply if you don’t have an NI number but you will need to provide alternative documents as proof of identity, such as your birth certificate, a bank statement or utility bill.To apply by post, you will need to fill out and send a form to your local electoral registration office.You will need the address of where you are registered to vote, a recent photo of yourself and your NI number.Again, other supporting documents are accepted but using these may prolong the application process.The electoral registration office must receive your form by 5pm, six working days before the election you wish to vote in.There is a different form to complete if you want to apply by post and you are living abroad, a member of the Armed Forces, a civil servant or a British Council employee.What if I do not have a valid ID?Anyone without a form of ID that fits the requirements can apply for a VAC.This is not a substitute to registering for vote, which must be done in advance of any application.Why was voter ID introduced?The aim was to stamp out voter fraud by forcing people to prove their identity at the polls.In his Government-commissioned report, Lord Pickles warned that the authorities were in a “state of denial” and “turning a blind eye” to the problem of electoral fraud.Why is voter ID so controversial?The Government has said the change is necessary to curb the “inexcusable potential” for “stealing someone’s vote” by simply quoting their name and address at the ballot box.However, critics say actual claims of electoral fraud are very rare in the UK.In 2019, the last general election year, there were only 33 allegations of impersonation at the polling station out of more than 58 million votes cast, according to the Electoral Reform Society.Opponents of the rule have also warned it will make it more difficult for certain people to vote, including the disabled, transgender and non-binary people, and black and ethnic minority groups."

The party also aims to build 1.5 million new homes in the next five years and says it will restore plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030.Meanwhile, part of Rishi Sunak’s plan to get people onto the property ladder is a resurrection of the Help to Buy scheme, which would provide first-time buyers with an equity loan of up to 20% towards the cost of one of these new homes.The Conservative Party’s manifesto also pledges to abolish National Insurance for the self-employed, implement tougher sentences for offences including knife crime, grooming and assaults against retail workers, and underlines the plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda, saying there will be a “regular rhythm of flights every month.”Two of Reform UK’s core five pledges also involve migration. The party says it would freeze non-essential immigration, but concedes there would be exceptions with work in healthcare considered essential.The Liberal Democrats plan to introduce free personal care in England, similar to the system that operates in Scotland where people needing help with daily tasks do not have to pay.While each party passionately puts forth its case to the electorate, it is ultimately down to voters to decide what – and who – they think will take the country forward.We want to know the issues that matter the most to you in this general election campaign.

The PM has also promised to serve as an MP for five years if the Tories lose the election.Mr Sunak hailed “good news” after official figures confirmed a drop in the rate of inflation. According to the Office for National Statistics, the rate of Consumer Prives Index fell to 2 per cent in May, down from 2.3 per cent in April.It comes as a new poll found more than half of the UK public thinks Reform UK leader Nigel Farage would make a bad or terrible prime minister.A YouGov survey found 55 per cent of Britons thought Mr Farage would make a bad (12 per cent) or terrible prime minister (43 per cent) a day after he unveiled his party’s manifesto.Key PointsInflation falls 2% returning to Bank of England targetRishi Sunak vows to serve five years as a backbench MPSunak: Labour’s new donors can afford Sir Keir’s tax risesPrime minister accused of ‘lying through his teeth’Reeves welcomes inflation drop but ‘cost of living still acute for families’Boris Johnson pulls out from Tory campaign to go on holidayRwanda plan is the ‘choice at this election’, Rishi Sunak claims09:00 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak has said the number of small boat crossings have fallen in the past year, but the number who have arrived so far this year is at a record level, Archie Mitchell reports.He stressed that there is a stark choice for voters at the general election between the Labour Party who will not send migrants to Rwanda, and the Conservatives who will.So far, the Conservatives have spent almost £300m of taxpayer cash without sending a single asylum seeker to the east African nation as part of the scheme.Sunak criticised for being ‘richer than the King’08:59 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak is grilled by an LBC caller for being “richer than the King” and being unable to relate to struggling poeple.A caller asks: “How as a prime minister that is richer than our king relate to any of our struggles?”The prime minister replies that he will “always have people’s backs in tough times”. But the caller accuses him of lying about supporting poeple through the pandemic.Nick Ferrari then asks the PM: “Do you accept you are rich?”Rishi Sunak replied yes he is rich, adding that he has been “very fortunate in my life”.“I’m not going to apologise for that because my parents worked really hard,” he added.The prime minister denied wearing a £500 coat to an election visit in Brighton and said “not a single person has spoken to me about what I am wearing” on the campaign trail.LBC plays clip from Figen Murray08:53 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak has been confronted by Figen Murray, the mother of Manchester Arena bombing victim Martyn Hett, over why he has not passed a law in her son’s honour yet, Archie Mitvhell reports.The prime minister was asked why it is referred to as a “priority” in the Conservative Party manifesto despite him promising Ms Murray 18 months ago that he would pass it.She said: “You have put in your manifesto that Martyn’s law is a priority.

She says the treatment has been horrible and what is happening with the health service is “frightening”.Mr Sunak says he is “sorry” to hear about what she had to go through. The prime minister said the pandemic made a differenxe to treatment quality and outlines the breast cancer measures he plans to implement.He adds: “Community diagnostic centres are opening...and the government is hiring more oncologists.”Rishi Sunak accused of ‘lying through his teeth’08:28 , Salma OuaguiraAn LBC caller has accused Rishi Sunak of “lying through his teeth” after the PM defended the Tories’ record on housing after 14 years.In a tough phone-in, Mr Sunak was told: “You’ve had a decade and a half to improve housing, to improve rental conditions, to improve any of the issues I talked about and I think that young people just don’t believe your promises anymore.”Mr Sunak said he had abolished tenant deposit fees and that the quality of rental accommodation has risen under the Tories.Sunak compares Diane Abbott comments to Tory donor Frank Hester’s racist remarks08:25 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak has repeated that the Tories’ biggest donor Frank Hester was “wrong” to say that Labour veteran Diane Abbott “makes you want to hate all black people” and “should be shot”, Archie Mitchell reports.But he said that “if people who are genuinely contrite have apologised and understand what they’ve done, that should be accepted”.The prime minister compared Mr Hester’s comments to comments made by Ms Abbott which she was suspended from the Labour Party for.She has since been readmitted, and the PM told LBC: “Diane Abbott has been readmitted into the Labour Party, and she herself had made some comments in the past, that weren’t appropriate, but she apologised for those and was readmitted back into the Labour Party after having the whip withdrawn.”Sunak challenged over life chances for young people08:21 , Salma OuaguiraA young caller has challenged the prime minister over the life chances of young people after 14 years of Conservative government, Archie Mitchell reports.The LBC listener said housing is now unaffordable, tuition fees have risen, the NHS is crumbling and that the Tories have done little to tackle climate change. “How could you possibly argue that life is better for young people after consecutive Tory prime ministers?” the caller asked.Mr Sunak did not address the party’s record, promising instead to make it easier for young people to buy houses if he is re-elected. (LBC)Rishi Sunak vows to serve five years as a backbench MP08:15 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak has promised to serve his five year term as a backbench MP for Richmond and Northallerton if he loses the general election but holds his seat, Archie Mithell reports.The prime minister had been expected to swan off to California rather than spend five years travelling between the North Yorkshire seat and London.He told LBC he was focused on winning the general election but he “hopes very much” to represent them for another parliament.Labour’s new donors can afford Sir Keir’s tax rises, Rishi Sunak says08:14 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak has brushed off the defection of major Tory donor John Caudwell to Labour, saying he can “probably afford the party’s tax rises”, Archie Mitchell reports.The prime minister said as “Britain’s richest men”, Mr Caudwell and Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who is also backing Labour, they will be fine under Sir Keir Starmer’s rule.“But for tens of millions of people who are working really hard, they can’t and I want to cut people’s taxes,” Mr Sunak told LBC.Rishi Sunak: ‘I am really energised talking to the country’08:11 , Salma OuaguiraRishi Sunak has ignored a question about how well he thinks the campaign is going, instead telling an LBC caller he is “energised” talking to the country and launching into his stump campaign speech, Archie Mitchell reports.The prime minister said Labour would put people’s taxes up while the Conservatives would cut them.Asked about the huge gap between Labour and the Conservatives in the polls, Mr Sunak said there is only one poll that matters, the general election on 4 July. (LBC)Rishi Sunak to face LBC radio call-in08:07 , Salma OuaguiraThe prime minister is set to face voters in another LBC radio call-in after Sir Keir Starmer was grilled live on Tuesday.Mr Sunak will appear on Nick Ferrari’s radio show to answer questions from listeners all over the country this morning.It comes as the Labour leader continued to insist Labour has no plans to raise taxes outside those it has already specified during the programme yesterday.“None of our plans require tax rises over and above the ones we have set out,” he said.Pressed on whether this would include a council tax band revaluation, he said: “What I am not going to do is sit here two-and-a-bit weeks before the election and write the budgets for the next five years.“What I can say is that none of our plans require a tax rise, and that is for a reason, and the reason is our focus in getting our economy going, on building, on growing, on raising living standards, on creating wealth.”Rishi Sunak celebrates ‘inflation back to normal'08:02 , Salma OuaguiraGood news this morning👇 pic.twitter.com/8mNVIQBGAz— Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak) June 19, 2024Reeves says inflation drop welcome but 'cost of living still acute for families’07:43 , Salma OuaguiraThe shadow chancellor has reacted to the announcement that inflation has dropped 2 per cent returning to the Bank of England’s target.Reacting to the announcement, she said the drop is welcomed but there’s nothing to celebrate.She told Sky News: “We welcome the fact that inflation has come back to the target, but unlike the Conservative ministers I am not going to claim that everything is fine.Ms Reeves added that the cost of living crisis is “still acute for many families” and warned voters about “five more years of the same with the Conservatives”.She said: “While the numbers on inflation are welcomed, I am not going to start claiming that somehow things are all ok today because I know that for many people they are not.”Rachel Reeves speaking on Sky News (Sky News)Labour frontbencher fails to rule out fiscal event before summer07:35 , Salma OuaguiraLabour frontbencher Anneliese Dodds has refused to rule out that the party could hold a summer Budget if they win the general election.Asked the question during an interview on Sky News, Ms Dodds said: “Well, I’m going to have to say something before I answer that question, which is that barely any votes have been cast. Postal votes are only just starting to land now. So, you know, still lots of people who don’t know. We’re getting up and down the country to have that conversation with them.“If we are given that chance to serve, the very first thing that we will do for our economy is that first economic step that Keir and Rachel set out before the general election was even called.” (REUTERS)Johnson set to go on holiday rather than campaign for Tories07:15 , Alexander ButlerBoris Johnson is set to go on holiday rather than join the Conservative campaign trail ahead of the general election, according to Tory sources.The former prime minister, who turned 60 on Wednesday, is expected to go on his second summer holiday this year within the next few days and return on 3 July,The Times reported.Despite endorsing 50 Tory candidates across the country, Johnson is no longer expected to join the Tories on the doorstep due to the party facing decimation in red wall seats he won in 2019.Breaking: Inflation falls 2% returning to Bank of England target07:13 , Salma OuaguiraUK Inflation dropped to 2% in May, which is down from 2.3% in April, returning to the official target set by the Bank of England.It marks the first time inflation has been at the Bank of England’s target since July 2021, before the cost-of-living crisis saw inflation shoot up – at one stage hitting levels not seen for 40 years.The good news are likely to give a pre-election boost to the Conservatives, with Rishi Sunak already declaring victory on inflation last month – even though inflation was always expected to fall sharply as rising energy and food costs subside.But experts said it is unlikely to boost chances of an early summer interest rate cut.Most economists believe the Bank of England will hold rates at 5.25% on Thursday, with the election denting hopes of a reduction before the nation head to the polls on July 4.Investec economist Sandra Horsfield said: “Welcome though a return to target inflation would be, the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) is unlikely to be fully satisfied should the numbers meet our expectations. In the (Bank’s) May Monetary Policy Report, the baseline forecast was for a 1.9% inflation rate. Nor it is clear that inflation will stay at 2% from now on – In fact, we expect a small rise again over the second half of the year.”General Election Campaign: 15 days to go07:08 , Salma OuaguiraWith just over two weeks to go to the polls, parties are entering the last sprint of the campaign trail.Here’s what can we expect from today:Rishi Sunak will be answering calls from voters in an hour-long LBC morning phone-in.The SNP will unveil its manifesto in Edinburgh where John Swinney will appear alongside Patina activists.Sir Keir Starmer and shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves will visit a supermarket in Wiltshire.Daisy Cooper to unveil a new poster van in Jeremy Hunt’s Godalming and Ash constituency.Rochdale MP George Galloway is expected to launch his manifesto in Manchester.Cabinet wives Akshata Murty, Lucia Hunt and Susie Cleverly are campaigning with Lucy Frazer in Cambridgeshire.We’ll also learn the final number of people who have registered to vote.The Office for National Statistic will publish inflation figures.From Dawn Butler’s rap to Suella’s viral clip, this ‘TikTok election’ isn’t working07:00 , Alexander ButlerFrom Dawn Butler’s rap to Suella’s viral clip, this ‘TikTok election’ isn’t workingInside election social media campaign costs as Labour outspends all other parties combined05:00 , Alexander ButlerLabour has spent over £2.4 million on social media ads since the general election campaign began, more than twice as much as the Tories.Analysis by campaign spending non-profit Who Targets Me has found political parties spent more than £3.49 million on social media advertising since Rishi Sunak called the election on 22 May.Around 70 per cent of that has been commissioned by Labour Party groups and candidates, including Sir Keir Starmer, Welsh Labour, and Rachel Reeves.Inside election social media campaign costs as Labour outspends all parties combinedLabour wants a new Brexit deal – here’s why business shouldn’t get its hopes up04:00 , Alexander ButlerLabour wants a new Brexit deal – here’s why business shouldn’t get its hopes upIndependent readers say addressing Brexit should be a priority for the next government02:00 , Alexander ButlerReaders say addressing Brexit should be a priority for the next governmentGeneral Election 2024: How do I vote on July 4 and when is the deadline to register?01:00 , Alexander ButlerThe UK will take to the polls on July 4 after prime minister Rishi Sunak called a snap general election at the end of May.Speaking outside of Downing Street, the prime minister announced that King Charles had granted his request to dissolve Parliament and promised to “fight for every vote” in the run up to polling day.The following weeks have seen fervent campaigning from all parties, as they vie for votes up and down the country.

More than 800 planned operations and 700 outpatient appointments had to be rearranged.The former head of National Cyber Security Centre quickly blamed a Russian cyber group.Meanwhile, AI tools have been used to produce fake audio recordings of politicians such as Labour leader Keir Starmer and London mayor Sadiq Khan.Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting was also mimicked in a “deepfake” – a digitally-doctored video – which was shared widely online.Here’s an example of how easy it is to produce fake content now:🇬🇧 We found that AI voice tools can be easily manipulated to generate disinfo ahead of the UK elections, including false clips of Rishi Sunak & Keir Starmer.AI-generated election disinfo can mislead voters & harm democracy. Listen to Starmer's voice clone 🎧 pic.twitter.com/0VzwNU7Tld— Center for Countering Digital Hate (@CCDHate) June 17, 2024Why would Russia want to interfere with British politics?Senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, Keir Giles, told HuffPost UK: “There shouldn’t be any doubt that Russia is interested in interfering in our elections.”Similarly, Pia Huesch, a research analyst at the British defence and security think tank Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) said Britain’s vocal support of Ukraine means the elections are “naturally at the receiving end of Russian information operations”.Both experts agreed Moscow is not looking for a particular outcome – it only wants to cause disruption.As Giles noted, the Conservatives and Labour, “are basically indistinguishable”  in their opposition to Russia and support for Ukraine amid the ongoing war.“Russia wants to undermine faith in government institutions, faith in democracy, faith and democratic processes,” he said. “By policing the suggestion that they might have influenced the results of one of those processes, the effect is a win as far as Moscow is concerned.”Giles pointed out there is little solid proof of Russian interference in UK politics.The government’s 2020 Russia report said “credible open-source commentary” suggested Moscow ran “influence campaigns” related to the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.But, despite speculation about the 2016 EU referendum and 2019 general election, it’s unclear if either event was subject to Moscow meddling.And that’s still the situation years later.Giles said: “There are a lot of unknowns about the extent to which Russia is operating at the moment, because finding that out takes a big investment in resources and manpower and government attention, which it does not always get.”What form of interference is likely to come in?Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, Centre for Counting Digital Hate (CCDH) told HuffPost UK that “online misinformation about elections” has always been a threat to democracies.Introducing sophisticated yet unsafe AI technology is just going to pour petrol on the fire.”Imran Ahmed, CCDHBut he noted it is even tougher now because leading generative AI platforms have “insufficient guardrails to stop bad actors using them to produce political misinformation”.Ahmed said: “Social media companies have never got to grips with the problem.“Introducing sophisticated yet unsafe AI technology is just going to pour petrol on the fire.”CCDH warned that AI platforms have become highly sophisticated already, and quality is constantly improving, making it harder for the ordinary user to differentiate between what’s real and what is not.In fact, Reuters’ 2024 Digital News Report found 59% of people are concerned about identifying what is real and what is fake when consuming online news.That’s an increase of three percentage points in the last year.Ahmed warned that over time, the “risk that elections will be adversely impacted” will only become more severe.He said: “AI image and audio generators are readily available to anyone, making them a potential tool for foreign governments interested in disrupting democracy. “Just last month, OpenAI reported intercepting Russian groups using AI to advance their agendas.”Huesch told HuffPost UK that while bots and AI are causing more disruption, she believes it does not have to be that sophisticated to “further feed into people’s fears and beliefs”.“For many, these campaigns reaffirm and perhaps amplify existing beliefs but it does not take a sophisticated AI-generated deep fake to do so,” the researcher explained.As the Alan Turing Institute explains in this clip, there are many subtle ways voters can be confused by AI ahead of the election.❓ How can we stop AI-enabled threats damaging our democracy?📖 Find out how the Turing is analysing threats from around the world to help the UK strengthen protections for elections: https://t.co/6SW0sQIgnmpic.twitter.com/mu9kEinAuE— The Alan Turing Institute (@turinginst) June 1, 2024What about Russia’s wider information warfare? Russia’s disruption is not just limited to large events like elections.Giles warned: “Russian information warfare is a constant.“They can lay the groundwork for years and decades for influencing specific events that are later dates in one direction or another.”He referred to Jeremy Corbyn’s use of classified documents as evidence that the Tories were planning to sell off the NHS ahead of the 2019 general election.The government claimed this paperwork had been distributed by “Russian actors” online.The ex-Labour leader vehemently denied Labour may have benefited from a Russian operation, and Moscow denied any involvement. The source of the dossier remains unclear today.Further confusion followed when the Conservatives were accused of delaying the publication of a government report into Russia’s interference.When it was eventually published in July 2020, it spotted that some members of the Russian elite had connections to British politics, and liked to keep their money in the UK.As Giles said: “It’s a mistake to think that this is all just about trolls and bots on social media, because a lot of the highest value interventions of humans influencing decisions taken behind closed doors.”Is enough happening to deter such intervention?The general consensus is: no.Giles said: “What it requires is security, counterintelligence and police forces being given the political direction and, and instructions to prioritise that, which is not something that we’ve seen happening publicly in this country today.”Yet a planned public consultation on reforming the approach to the ransomware crisis was postponed when Sunak called the snap election.Ahmed also pointed out the lack of action from social media platforms, which he said need to “enforce their own rules”.He said at the moment they have an “abysmal track record of combating misinformation designed to mislead voters and undermine trust in the democratic process.”He said: “Generative AI is exciting and transformative – but in an online world dominated by vastly wealthy, unaccountable and irresponsible social media and AI companies, this technology also has the potential to turbo-charge the hate, lies and division that plague our societies.”Huesch had a more sympathetic approach.She said Russia’s goal of general disruption “makes it challenging” for anyone to respond: “How do you protect an abstract notion of trust that is neither easily measured, understood, nor [easy to] build?”She said the government has been taking it seriously, but warned that had not always been the case – as the 2020 Russia report found it had failed to properly assess Russian interference with the EU referendum of 2016.She added that the private sector needs to act because “it take the whole of society”, and we need to train ourselves to be “resilient against any disinformation”.How has the government responded to such warnings?In response to the parliamentary committee’s warning in May, a government spokesperson said: “Security is paramount and we are well prepared to ensure the integrity of the election, with robust systems in place to protect against interference.”Parliamentarians and election candidates were granted access to an “enhanced cyber security offer”, developed by the National Cyber Security Centre to protect against phishing attacks and foreign-influenced operations.Through the Defending Democracy Taskforce set up in 2022, the government said it announced ”£31m to protect our democratic processes and institutions”.“The National Security Act [of 2023] has additionally delivered a range of measures to strengthen the UK’s efforts to detect, deter and disrupt state threats,” the spokesperson added.Related...Support For Tories Is 'At Its Lowest Ever In British Polling History,' Elections Guru SaysRishi Sunak Booed And Heckled During Brutal Sky News Election GrillingGrant Shapps Squirms When Asked If Rishi Sunak Called Election Too Early"
The Guardian,Tory candidate accused of dog-whistle tactics against rival with Indian name,[],Aletha Adu,18 June 2024 at 1:06 pm·3-min read,18,June,2024,01:06:00,3,"A Conservative candidate has been criticised for sending letters to British-Pakistani voters allegedly insinuating they should vote for him instead of his Labour rival because of her Indian surname.Marco Longhi, the Tory candidate fighting for re-election in Dudley North against Sonia Kumar, has been accused of using dog-whistle politics and attempting to “alienate British Hindus”.In a letter to “voters of the British Pakistani/Kashmiri community in Dudley”, Longhi asked if the Labour candidate would speak for Kashmir in parliament. Kumar’s name was in bold, capitalised and underlined.Rishi Sunak has been called to withdraw his support for Longhi and condemn the letter.Related: Harold, Denise, Alison and Mark: Tories’ hypothetical target voters are all white, document revealsAnneliese Dodds, the chair of the Labour party, said: “This is clearly inappropriate, divisive, dog-whistle politics from the Conservatives. There is no place for such behaviour anywhere in our political system.“Rishi Sunak needs to take action immediately. If he fails to do so, it will show his promise of professionalism and accountability to be a hollow sham.”Kumar is a common Indian surname, with Hindu origins. As of 2014, 97% of all known holders of the surname were residents of India.There is no written record in Hansard of Longhi having brought up Kashmir in the chamber since he became an MP in 2019.Dodd’s comments were echoed by Labour’s candidate for Leicester East, Rajesh Agrawal, who classed the letter as a “shameful attempt to divide the area that Mr Longhi claims to represent”. Agrawal said it was “offensive to both Muslim and Hindu communities”.“There should be zero tolerance of the dog-whistle politics Mr Longhi is engaged in. Rishi Sunak should immediately remove Conservative party support for Mr Longhi’s campaign and apologise for attempting to alienate British Hindus,” he added.defaultKrish Raval, chair of Labour’s group for Indians, also criticised the letter, and the prime minister for failing to call out the divisive politics.“We find Marco Longhi’s comments racist, dangerous and wholly divisive,” Raval said, adding: “It is also disheartening to see an Indian-origin leader of the Conservatives let anti-Indian racism run rife through his party.”Sunder Katwala, director of the British Future thinktank, said: “Different parties, and candidates, have in past got into trouble making pitches to voters of one ethnicity/faith background that could harm the party if seen by voters of another background. It should not happen – especially in such brazen prejudiced form.“Obviously, any representative in parliament ought to be able to represent constituents of different ethnic and faith backgrounds. In my view any of the major parties should suspend a candidate for doing this.”Longhi later doubled down on his letter, telling GB News: “This is politics, isn’t it? Do you want someone who has consistently been supportive of Kashmiris where there have been human rights abuses or do you want someone called Sonia Kumar who no one has ever heard of?”The Guardian has contacted Longhi for comment."

That afternoon, an umbrella-less Mr Sunak announced his snap election decision and set in motion the vote to happen six weeks later on July 4.The choice means that Mr Sunak will have been in No 10 for 618 days by the polling date and has been called a “mistake” by figures like Prof Sir John Curtice, the polling expert.Why is there an election now?Tory figures close to general election planning had also been working under the assumption there was not going to be a summer ballot, but that all changed on May 22.Lord Cameron cut a trip to Albania short in order to return to a Cabinet meeting and Grant Shapps delayed a flight to a Nato meeting two hours to be there.On the day of the announcement, news came that the rate of inflation had fallen even further than expected, which Mr Sunak hailed as a sign that “everything is heading in the right direction”.With the Government’s record perhaps at its strongest on the economy, the Prime Minister was keen to use the news as a launchpad for triggering the election – but what else played into his decision?Key factors for the Prime Minister would have included whether economic statistics was continuing to improve, and whether polling and focus group research suggested that voters were feeling the positive effects of the National Insurance cuts, crediting the Tories for the boost.Getting Rwanda deportation flights off the ground also strengthened the case for going to the polls in the summer, along with a steady decline in the NHS elective waiting list.It had been rumoured that figures in Downing Street were mulling over whether it would be in the Tories’ interests to trigger a ballot sooner rather than later, despite being way behind Labour in the polls.Why was the general election not on the same day as the local elections?The general election could have been called on May 2 - the same day as the locals - but Rishi Sunak made the decision to avoid a spring poll.The Institute for Government pointed out that a spring election would avoid the risk that “a heavy defeat in the local elections could increase pressure on the Prime Minister – including from within his party – and make it difficult to regain momentum ahead of an election that would by then be less than a year away”.However, that opportunity passed. On March 14, the Prime Minister ruled out a national ballot on May 2, confirming there “won’t be a general election on that day”.It was thought that heavy losses at the locals could tempt restless Tory MPs to mount a challenge against their leader.However, despite a dire set of results for the Conservatives, resulting in hundreds of council seats lost, the rebels appear to have backed off for now.What happens next? Following Mr Sunak’s announcement on May 22, Parliament was prorogued and dissolved eight days later on May 30 after the Prime Minister was granted permission by the King Charles.Prorogation happened on May 24, in line with the 2022 Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act that sets out polling day to take place 25 working days following the dissolution on May 30, landing the general election on July 4.Election candidates have begun to use the six-week lead up to ballot day to campaign for their parties, including both Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer who have undertaken appearances up and down the country.Both leaders, and many more political figures, have also taken part in TV election debates in a bid to win over voters and released their 2024 party manifestos, starting with the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives. It is up to each party when to publish its manifesto, but an analysis by the Institute for Government shows that all Labour and Conservative manifestos since 1997 have been launched between 18 and 29 days before the election.Voter registration is usually open until the 12th working day before polling day, which indicates that it will close towards the end of June.How are general elections called?It is up to the Prime Minister to decide when to hold a national vote, but this power has only been restored in recent years.In 2011, the Fixed Term Parliaments Act effectively put the House of Commons in charge, with general elections held every five years unless a majority of MPs willed it otherwise.For an election to be called early, two thirds of the House had to back the plans. This is how Theresa May’s snap election was triggered in 2017. Alternatively, MPs could spark a ballot by passing a vote of no confidence in the Government.After trying and failing three times to secure the necessary two thirds majority for an early vote in 2019, the Tories opted to circumvent the law with a new purpose-built piece of legislation - the Early Parliamentary General Election Act - which required only a simple majority to pass. This paved the way for Boris Johnson’s snap election in 2019.The Government went on to repeal the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, replacing it with the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act. This new law stripped the Commons of its power to block an early ballot, putting the Prime Minister back in control.Traditionally, the Prime Minister travels to Buckingham Palace to request the dissolution of Parliament, before returning to Downing Street to announce the forthcoming election.How often are elections called? Each Parliament must be dissolved for a general election by the fifth anniversary of the day it first met.This measure was passed under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act by the 2011 coalition government, which set in stone the five-year periods between general elections.Elections may be held earlier – such occurred in 2017 with Theresa May and 2019 by Boris Johnson following a Brexit deadlock – under special circumstances.However, local elections such as the May 2024 by-elections and mayoral elections operate on a different time scale. Who can vote in the general election?The vast majority of UK adults can vote in a general election.In order to vote, you must:be registered to votebe 18 or over on the day of the election (‘polling day’)be a British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizenbe a resident at an address in the UK or Gibraltar, or living abroad and registered as an overseas voter (it is also possible to register if you have no fixed address)not be legally excluded from voting (for example, if you are serving a prison sentence)When should I register to vote?The deadline for registering to vote is usually midnight at the end of the 12th working day before polling day, meaning voter registration is open until June 18 at 11.59pm.When will polling take place?Parliament was dissolved a few days after the election announcement and polling day takes place 25 working days after that.The Civil Service has entered “purdah” – the period between an election being called and polling day which involves strict restrictions on the work of officials to ensure that Whitehall resources are not being used to benefit any party in particular."

Although a more seasoned politician now, he lacks the popular appeal of Ms Sturgeon.Many of the policy areas which will be debated in the election, such as education and health, are devolved to the Scottish Government at Holyrood. However, they are still likely to be debated in the general election campaign.Poll tracker: Conservatives falling as general election looms?Follow The Telegraph’s general election live coverageWhen will manifestos be released officially?John Swinney will launch the SNP’s official 2024 manifesto at a campaign event in Edinburgh today.It will be the last of the UK’s seven main political parties to release its blueprint for the nation, with Reform UK having published their document on Monday and Labour and the Conservatives releasing theirs last week.Here is a look at what the SNP could include in its 2024 election manifesto:IndependenceTax and spendingEconomyHealth and social careDefence and foreign affairsBrexitImmigrationEnergyEnvironmentIndependenceDemand negotiations with UK Government for another referendumProposal for party ‘independence’ logo to appear on ballot paperBefore he quit as First Minister, Humza Yousaf pledged that page one, line one of the manifesto will state: “Vote SNP for Scotland to become an independent country.”Following a series of policies being adopted and quickly dropped, the SNP has settled on a plan to demand negotiations with the UK Government for another independence referendum if the party wins a majority of the 57 seats that will be contested in Scotland, following boundary changes.It is highly unlikely that either Rishi Sunak or Sir Keir Starmer would agree to any such demand after the election. However, support for independence is polling much higher than backing for the SNP.The SNP hope the pledge will win back some of the independence supporters who have deserted the party in recent months and motivate them to turn out on election day.The party has even proposed new logos with “SNP independence” or “SNP for independence” to appear on general election ballot papers.Tax and spendingNational Insurance and inheritance tax devolved£12 billion wealth taxIncrease spending on affordable housingCap supermarket pricesReintroduce mortgage interest tax reliefThe SNP has already made Scotland the highest taxed part of the UK thanks to their control of income tax bands and rates. For 2024/25 there are six income tax bands in Scotland compared to three south of the border.Shona Robison, the SNP Finance Secretary, has made clear her opposition to the Chancellor’s decision to cut personal taxes in his Autumn and Spring Budgets, arguing the funding should instead have been spent on public services.To avoid another “damaging decade” of austerity, the SNP will argue for both Labour and the Tories to abandon their fiscal rules and focus on spending.The SNP has previously supported full fiscal autonomy – Scotland having control over all taxation north of the border – as a stepping stone to independence.The manifesto could propose the devolution of taxes such as National Insurance and inheritance tax with a view to hiking rates for wealthier Scots.In addition to scrapping non-dom tax status, the SNP has called for the UK Government to increase capital gains tax, tax share buybacks and increase taxes on those earning more than £100,000.A £12 billion wealth tax has also been proposed by the Nationalists, although there are scant details on how this would be assessed and collected.Ms Robison has also called for a huge increase in capital spending, particularly on affordable housing, arguing this would stimulate economic growth.Among their other spending proposals to help families with the cost of living are reintroducing mortgage interest tax relief, capping supermarket food prices, and copying the £25-per-week Scottish Child Payment for poorer families across the UK.EconomyIndependence would result in better economic performanceHighlight growth rates in other small countries in EuropeThe manifesto will likely point to the economic crisis that occurred during Liz Truss’s short-lived government, and the UK’s sluggish growth rates over recent years.It is expected to argue that Scotland would perform much better after independence, highlighting growth rates in other small countries in Europe.Health and social careCall for £15 billion increase in health spending in EnglandExtra £1.5 billion funding generated through the Barnett formulaAlthough control of the Scottish NHS is devolved to the SNP government, expect the party’s manifesto to call for a massive increase in health spending in England. Ahead of March’s Spring Budget, the Nationalists called for a £15 billion increase.This would generate an extra £1.5 billion funding for the Scottish Government through the Barnett formula, which could be used on Scotland’s struggling NHS.Defence and foreign affairsRemoval of UK’s Trident nuclear deterrent from FaslaneImmediate ceasefire in GazaCreation of separate Palestinian stateThe SNP has long called for the removal of Britain’s Trident nuclear deterrent from its Faslane base on the Clyde. Before the 2019 election, Nicola Sturgeon said it would be a red line for the SNP if it were to back any Labour government.The SNP has generally supported the UK Government’s stance on the Ukraine conflict but has taken a much more pro-Palestine stance over the conflict in Gaza. Mr Yousaf, whose wife is Palestinian, has accused Israel of inflicting a “collective punishment” on the people of Gaza in response to the Hamas terror attack.Expect the manifesto to include demands for an immediate ceasefire and the creation of a separate Palestinian state.BrexitVote SNP to ‘exit Brexit’EU single market benefits from independenceMr Yousaf previously urged Scots to vote SNP to “exit Brexit”, in a rehash of the 2017 and 2019 election campaigns. More than six out of 10 Scots voted Remain in the EU referendum and more recent polling on the issue has suggested this stance has not changed.With neither the Tories or Labour planning to rerun the referendum, expect the SNP manifesto to argue that the only way for Scotland to be part of the EU and to gain the benefits of the single market is to become independent.ImmigrationReturn of free movement from the EUPowers to issue work permits to foreignersIntroduce post-study and family visasMore welcome regime for asylum seekersScotland’s working age population is expected to shrink over the coming decades, creating a demographic timebomb with fewer working people to pay for services for a larger number of elderly pensioners.The SNP favours a much more liberal immigration policy than the UK Government, including the return of free movement from the EU.It also wants Holyrood to have powers to issue work permits to foreigners, based on the distinctive needs of the Scottish economy. New working visas, five-year post-study visas and family visas with much lower barriers than the UK currently uses would be introduced.The SNP has called for a much more welcome regime for asylum seekers and his government has argued that an independent Scotland would allow them to work and claim benefits.EnergyExpansion in onshore and offshore wind turbines£400 annual energy bill discount for householdsScrap electricity and gas standing chargesSocial energy tariff to assist households with disabled peopleThe party has a difficult political tightrope to walk over the future of North Sea oil and gas, which is responsible for around 90,000 highly paid jobs in Scotland.On June 3, during a debate between Scottish party leaders, Mr Swinney refused to say whether the SNP would back new oil and gas exploration there.As part of the SNP’s environmental agenda, it has argued for a presumption against further exploration being allowed. Mr Yousaf attacked the UK Government’s decision last September to give the green light to Rosebank, the UK’s largest untapped field.But the Nationalists are facing a difficult fight to hold their seats in the north east of Scotland, where most of the oil jobs are based.Stephen Flynn, the SNP’s Westminster leader and Aberdeen South MP, is expected to exert pressure on Mr Yousaf to tone down some of the party’s anti-oil rhetoric.The SNP recently opposed Labour’s plan to raise the windfall tax on fossil fuels from 75 per cent of excess profits to 78 per cent, while also extending it to 2029. He said there was  “extreme anger” from people in the north east of Scotland at the proposal.The SNP has repeatedly boasted of Scotland’s wind power potential so expect the manifesto to propose an overhaul in the subsidy regime to achieve a massive expansion in the number of onshore and offshore turbines.The Nationalists have also called on the UK Government to introduce a £400 annual energy bill discount for households and to scrap electricity and gas standing charges.A social energy tariff to assist households with disabled people with their energy bills would also be introduced, under their proposals.EnvironmentTurbocharge investment in green energyCall for UK-wide deposit return scheme to include glassSpeed up the roll-out of heat pumpsMs Sturgeon and Mr Yousaf made the transition to net zero one of the tenets of their tenure as First Minister. The SNP is in coalition at Holyrood with the hard-Left Scottish Greens, who have two ministers in his government.They have introduced legally binding targets for Scotland to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045 – five years earlier than the UK as a whole. However, interim targets were recently scrapped, a move that contributed significantly to the divorce with the Greens.The SNP has taken up Labour’s abandoned plan to spend at least £28 billion a year to “turbocharge investment in green energy”.The Scottish Nationalists opposed Rishi Sunak’s decision to delay the ban on new petrol and diesel from 2030 to 2035.The manifesto could also call for a UK-wide deposit return scheme that includes glass after attempts to introduce one in Scotland only descended into a debacle.It is also expected to include measures to dramatically speed up the roll-out of heat pumps, with auditors warning only 5,000 were installed in 2022, far short of the Scottish Government’s target of 25,000 per year.Can you vote for the SNP in England?The SNP have only ever fielded candidates in Scotland and will not be contesting any seats in England or Wales.Standing candidates outside of Scotland runs counter to the party’s central aim of negotiating another independence referendum."
