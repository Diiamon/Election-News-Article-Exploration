The Telegraph,Starmer leaves door open to tax rises for millions as he defines ‘working people’,"['‘Bills are bearing down’', 'Less than £1,000 savings', 'Private school VAT']",Nick Gutteridge,18 June 2024 at 8:43 pm·4-min read,18,June,2024,08:43:00,4,"Sir Keir Starmer has opened the door to tax rises for millions of Britons by defining a working person as someone who relies on public services and doesn’t have savings.The Labour leader has repeatedly ruled out putting up taxes on what he calls “working people” who he says have borne the brunt of the cost of living crisis.Asked what he meant by the term, he said it refers to “people who earn their living, rely on our services and don’t really have the ability to write a cheque when they get into trouble”.His definition means millions of Britons including pensioners, savers, and those who use private services like healthcare may not be covered by his tax rise pledge.Senior Tories said the remarks showed that Sir Keir was preparing to “wallop” savers and homeowners with tax hikes, warning: “Be very afraid.”Iain Duncan Smith said Sir Keir had made 'a big admission' - Carl Court/GettyLabour has promised not to raise rates of income tax, national insurance or VAT for at least five years if it wins power, but has refused to rule out other tax rises.Sir Keir would not rule out a hike in council tax on Tuesday, saying that he could not “sit here two weeks before the election and write the budgets for the next five years”.But he said he had been “really clear we’re not going to be raising tax on working people” and that “none of our plans require tax rises over and above the ones we’ve set out”.Asked what he meant by working people, the Labour leader replied: “The person I have in my mind when I say working people is people who earn their living, rely on our services and don’t really have the ability to write a cheque when they get into trouble.“So the sort of people I’m meeting pretty well every day now. It’s quite a big group because these days there are many people obviously not so well-off.”‘Bills are bearing down’He gave the example of a woman he met in Southampton who has “got one job, she’s trying to get another job, and the bills are still bearing down on her”.“That’s the sort of person I have in my mind’s eye,” he added.Sir Iain Duncan Smith, a former Tory leader, said: “How unbelievable to say those who generate wealth, who work hard, who are successful, who add huge value to the British economy, to dismiss them completely.“They are his targets for higher taxation. If you have savings, if you own a home, if you own wealth, you are going to get walloped. That is a big admission.“His levelling-up isn’t levelling-up, it’s levelling-down. The old socialist in there who supported Jeremy Corbyn is still alive and well.”Less than £1,000 savingsThere are 11 million working-age people in Britain who have less than £1,000 in savings according to a recent Resolution Foundation report.That figure is typically considered to be the minimum “rainy day” contingency fund needed to cover unexpected costs that may crop up in life.But that still means two in three working households do have what could be considered sufficient savings to not qualify as “working people” under Sir Keir’s definition.On top of that one in eight Britons now rely on private health insurance, according to a survey carried out by pollsters YouGov last year.Private school VATThe parents of 615,000 children who are privately educated are already facing having to fork out thousands more when VAT is applied to private school fees.Then there are the 12.5 million retirees who on the current trajectory face being taxed on the state pension for the first time from 2027 under a Labour government.Sir Keir’s comments also imply that people who own substantial assets, such as the 2.8 million landlords in the UK, would also not be considered working people."
The Guardian,Keir Starmer commits to judge-led inquiry into Nottingham killings,[],Jessica Murray,18 June 2024 at 7:24 pm·3-min read,18,June,2024,07:24:00,3,"Keir Starmer has committed to a judge-led inquiry into the Nottingham attacks if Labour wins the election, saying there are “too many examples of victims and family members being let down”.Barnaby Webber, Grace O’Malley-Kumar and Ian Coates were stabbed to death last year by Valdo Calocane, who was sentenced to a hospital order after pleading guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility due to paranoid schizophrenia.Barnaby’s mother, Emma Webber, directly challenged Starmer during a listener phone-in on LBC.She asked him: “If you do get into Downing Street, what are your thoughts about following through with the call for a public inquiry, or possibly a jury and judge-led inquest?“And also your thoughts please on the urgent need to reform our homicide laws and also the victim support in this country? Which from bitter experience, I can confirm is woeful and very inadequate.”The Labour leader replied that the families had been through a “horrific experience” as he committed to holding a judge-led inquiry if Labour win.“She wants a judge-led inquiry and I said when I met her that I thought that was the right way forward, and we would do that,” he said.“I was very concerned when I heard from her directly about the way the system had let her and the other family members down in relation to the charges that were brought, the communications with the family, and so many other aspects.”He said listening to what the families had been through was “really difficult”.“My resolve is to ensure that we have that inquiry and make sure that that doesn’t happen to anyone else. I’ve had too many examples of victims and family members being let down. We have to improve here,” Starmer said.Calocane killed the university students O’Malley-Kumar and Webber, both 19, and Coates, a 65-year-old school caretaker, and ran over three other people in a spate of violence in Nottingham last June.Following Calocane’s sentencing hearing in January, Webber said “true justice has not been served”. He was handed a hospital order and not jailed.His sentence was deemed unduly lenient by the attorney general, who referred it to the court of appeal, where lawyers argued Calocane should be given a hybrid order, under which he would be sent to prison if deemed fit enough to be discharged from hospital. The application was rejected.The families of the victims have long been calling for a public inquiry to investigate the missed opportunities to stop Calocane before the attacks.Sanjoy Kumar, the father of Grace O’Malley-Kumar, said: “We have to have a public inquiry. These individual investigations that have been set up will not change legislation, and they will not change the status quo.”Starmer previously backed their calls, saying earlier this year: “I think somebody outside of this, independent, needs to look at exactly what happened, what were the points at which there could have been an intervention and why it didn’t happen. That is the least that these families are owed.”"
HuffPost UK,How The Tories' Election Campaign Is Becoming More Desperate The Closer We Get To July 4,[],Kevin Schofield,18 June 2024 at 7:48 pm·3-min read,18,June,2024,07:48:00,3,"Rishi Sunak attends the plenary session of the Summit on peace in Ukraine, at the luxury Burgenstock resort, near Lucerne. URS FLUEELER via Getty ImagesWith a little over two weeks until the general election, one thing is becoming more apparent every day. The opinion polls are not shifting and the level of panic in Tory headquarters is becoming more acute.The first signs of this came last week, when Grant Shapps raised the possibility of Labour winning a “super-majority”.Leaving aside the question of how that is different from a normal majority, the defence secretary appeared to be conceding that Keir Starmer is not on course to win, but to win big.The Tory campaign was no longer about trying to get Rishi Sunak re-elected prime minister, but about trying to limit the size of the seemingly inevitable Labour victory.Although the PM himself said all the right things about fighting for every vote, if anything, the Tory campaign has become even more desperate this week.Responding to yesterday’s launch of Reform UK’s election manifesto, a Conservative spokesperson warned that a vote for Nigel Farage’s party could put Labour in power for a “generation” - widely considered to be at least 15 years.Farming minister Mark Spencer doubled down on that outlandish prediction this morning by insisting Labour could be in government for 20 years if it wins on July 4 and then implements plans to give 16 and 17-year-olds the vote.Shapps, meanwhile, who polls suggest is on course to lose his seat next month, conceded yesterday that a Labour victory was now “likely”.Tory chairman Richard Holden got in on the act last night, raising the prospect of a “big Labour majority” in an attempt to scare voters into backing the Conservatives.In yet another sign of desperation, the Tories are also rolling out Boris Johnson - who was forced to resign as PM in disgrace following partygate and the Chris Pincher scandal - in a last-ditch attempt to save some seats.He has put his name to thousands of Tory election leaflets urging voters who backed him in 2019 not to desert the party this time around.Responding to that development, Starmer told LBC this morning: “They started off saying vote Tory because they were going to win, then they said vote Tory because Labour’s going to win, now they’re saying something about Boris Johnson.“Honestly, if you can’t even have a strategy that holds for six weeks, you really don’t deserve to win.”According to The Sunday Times, senior Tories are urging Sunak to “go for the jugular” in the final fortnight of the campaign by being relentlessly negative about the prospects of a Keir Starmer government.But speaking on his Political Currency podcast, former Tory chancellor George Osborne said that would be a “disaster”.“He needs to just do what he’s doing, which is continue to show energy and enthusiasm and commitment and do the best he can,” he said.“One thing I would not do is take the advice of various people in the Tory Party - terrible advice - which is to switch and become the lead negative campaigner for the Conservatives against Keir Starmer.“That would be a disaster for the party but also a disaster for him.”Related...Not Sure Who To Vote For, But Don't Want The Tories?

I did take a post.

I say yes, and suddenly I am a supporter.“Have we had trouble, yes we have.

mini-budget, Nigel Farage said: “I don’t want to work with the OBR (Office for Budget Responsibility).“I mean they’re part of the problem, not part of the solution. We need radical, fresh thinking, we haven’t had it for years in this country. We are getting poorer.He added: “Britain is broken, we’re presenting some radical ideas for how we can change that.”Asked why his party has faced repeated controversies with former candidates engaging with right-wing groups on social media, Mr Farage said: “How you define extreme of course is very difficult and we can find many people in the Labour Party and call them extreme left.“Look, we’ve had some problems, the Greens have had even bigger problems than I’ve had. All I will say is that we did put in place a proper vetting system, we paid a fortune for it, someone didn’t deliver.”Rishi Sunak jokes with staff at North Sea gas rigMonday 17 June 2024 15:47 , Holly EvansRishi Sunak spoke to workers at the gas rig in the North Sea about the upsides and difficulties of their job.The Prime Minister was told there is a gym, sauna, cinema and pool table onsite for staff to use.“I thought someone said there was a swimming pool.

It’s work from home, pop into Whitehall a couple of days a week.”He added: “If you’re running a company and things are tight, you say to your managers and middle managers, ‘Right, I’m sorry, this is the way it is, you’ve got to cut £5 in £100’ – in fact in tough times it might be £10 in £100 or £20 in £100, and you have to find a way of doing that without affecting the product that we’re selling to the public.”Mr Farage added: “Some of these things we’re proposing are tough but, look, the accumulated national debt is now £2.7 trillion, it was just under £1 trillion when the Tories came to power, we simply cannot go on like this.Farage said the UK is ‘skint’ and in ‘real trouble’ (REUTERS)"
The Independent,What is tactical voting and where has it been encouraged in the 2024 general election?,"['What is tactical voting?', 'Where has tactical voting been recommended?', 'Does tactical voting work? ', 'What impact could tactical voting have on the 2024 General Election?']",Jabed Ahmed and Albert Toth,18 June 2024 at 7:29 pm·7-min read,18,June,2024,07:29:00,7,"Britain will head to the polls on July 4 after prime minister Rishi Sunak called a snap general election at the end of May.June has seen intense vote-garnering efforts from all political parties as leaders chat, debate, and even paddle across the country to win over as many as possible. All parties have now revealed their election manifestos, laying out their vision for the country.Current polling would suggest things are not looking good for the Conservatives, with most trackers firmly putting Labour an average 20 points ahead of the governing party.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak during a visit to Cambridge Rugby Club in Cambridge (Joe Giddens/PA Wire)However, recent research by campaign group Best for Britain shows that 36 per cent of people are undecided in some constituencies. In more bad news for the government, the group has also identified 451 ‘tactical voting seats’ where voters have the best chance of ousting the Tories.Here’s everything you need to know about tactical voting and how important it could be in the upcoming general election:What is tactical voting?Tactical voting is when a voter casts their ballot for the candidate they believe is most likely to defeat another party’s candidate (usually the Conservatives), even if this candidate is not necessarily their first choice.Some see this as a necessary practice due to the UK’s ‘First Past The Post’ (FPTP) voting system. Under FPTP, it is the candidate who gets the most votes that wins.It may seem like the most democratic system to decide a winner at first glance, but many argue that FPTP does not always produce results that reflect the political leanings of the area.This is because some parties are much more politically aligned than others. For instance, in areas where the votes for Labour and the Liberal Democrats outweigh that for the Conservative candidate, but neither beat them alone, the Conservative candidate wins.Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer on the General Election campaign trail on Thursday (Gareth Fuller/PA Wire)However, the results would indicate that the majority of voters in this area support more progressive, left-wing or centre-left politicians.Groups such as the Electoral Reform Society (ERS) campaign to change this, pointing out that the MPs elected to parliament rarely reflect the popular vote.For instance, at the 2019 general election, 11.5 per cent of people voted for the Liberal Democrats, but they only secured 1.7 per cent of seats. The Conservatives’ 43.6 per cent, on the other hand, translated to 56.2 per cent of seats.The ERS promotes voting systems that are designed to tackle this issue, such as the Single Transferable Vote or Alternative Vote where voters can rank candidates by preference.However, in 2011 the UK was given a referendum on switching the way people vote to the Alternative Vote system, where the votes against it were nearly 68 per cent.Where has tactical voting been recommended?Ahead of polling day, campaign group Best for Britain has produced a list of tactical voting recommendations for voters who are keen to see the Tories ousted from government.The group recommends 451 candidates across the UK, around 70 per cent of MPs. These comprise 370 seats for Labour, 69 for the Lib Dems, seven for the SNP, three for the Greens and two for Plaid Cymru.Amongst the many seats targeted are those of Jacob Rees-Mogg (North East Somerset), Liz Truss (South West Norfolk) and Suella Braverman (Fareham and Waterlooville).If tactical voting was carried out according to their plan, Best for Britain project the Conservatives could wake up to as few as 45 seats on July 5, an astounding loss of 320. Meanwhile, Labour would take an average of 445, gaining 243.Does tactical voting work? Tactical voting could work, if it was carried out en masse. However, despite talk of tactical voting at most major elections, there is little evidence that it has made a significant impact in the past.There are many seats in the UK where a sustained tactical vote campaign would have changed the final result. For instance, in the 2023 Uxbridge by-election, the Conservatives secured 13,965 votes, while Labour secured 13,470.Meanwhile, the Greens gained 893 votes, coming in third. If all these votes were instead tactically given to Labour, it would have been a victory for the party in Boris Johnson’s former seat.It is a similar story for the seat of Somerset North East, held by Jacob Rees-Mogg since 2010. In 2019, Mr Rees-Mogg secured 28,360 votes, while Labour and the Lib Dems combined secured 26,053.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey (Joe Giddens/PA) (PA Wire)It is possible a combined effort could’ve secured the seat for either party, although neither has assented to a tactical voting pact in the past.However, the Lib Dems won the seat of Somerton and Frome for the first time since 2010 in last year’s by-election, with tactical voting thought to be a major factor. The Labour vote share had dwindled from 12.9 per cent in 2019, to just 2.6.“It is no secret that some Labour and Green party voters lent us their votes in Somerset and we are very grateful for their support,” said Lib Dem leader Ed Davey.“In many seats across the south-west, voters at the next election will be faced with a similar choice between the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives.”What impact could tactical voting have on the 2024 General Election?Polling experts have said an increase in tactical voting is “bad news for the Conservative Party”, but there may still be some three-way marginal seats between the Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems.Chris Hopkins, political research director at leading polling consultancy Savanta, told The Independent: ""Voters have got increasingly sophisticated in understanding how in a first past the post system, their vote can be as effective as possible.“In particular this is bad news for the Conservative Party, where there will be plenty of natural Labour supporters in the South West who will back the Lib Dems, as they know they are their best chance of getting rid of the Tories.""That being said, because of the forecasted size of the swing from Conservative to Labour, there are some three-way marginals where Labour and the Lib Dems may be unwilling to step aside. That could mean voters are told different things about who is 'most likely to win here', and could lead to split, enabling some Conservative MPs to hold on.""Prime Minister Rishi Sunak during a General Election campaign event at ExCeL London (Stefan Rousseau/PA) (PA Wire)Campaigners have also added tactical voting will help deliver a “progressive government”, but warned the first-past-the-post system (FPTP) must be changed to better represent voting intentions.Neal Lawson, executive director at Compass, told The Independent: “We desperately need a progressive government, and tactical voting will no doubt play a vital role in helping to deliver one - but voting tactically without conditions only entrenches the pendulum politics that grinds us all down and alienates voters from the political process.“The worry is that without a commitment to changing the system, tactical voting enshrines the abusive nature of First Past the Post and forces voters to continue voting tactically forever more.“If Labour does win the next election on the back of lent votes, they should commit to getting rid of FPTP and replacing it with a system that can better represent the progressive majority that already exists in this country.”Naomi Smith, CEO of Best for Britain and founder of tactical voting platform, GetVoting.org, said: “Our polling shows 13 million Brits are ready to vote tactically for change, and these voters will be key to a defeat that would keep the Tories out for a decade and the difference between deliverance or defeat for the likes of Rishi Sunak, Jeremy Hunt and Liz Truss.“Best for Britain will be helping voters get it right at GetVoting.org with expert constituency level insights and voting recommendations before polling day.”"
The Telegraph,Tories turn to Boris Johnson to counter Reform,[],Ben Riley-Smith,18 June 2024 at 6:40 am·4-min read,18,June,2024,06:40:00,4,"Boris Johnson is being drafted in by the Tories to play a more active role in the election campaign as the party seeks to counter the threat from Reform UK.Tens of thousands of letters signed by the former prime minister, who has been pictured on holiday in Italy, are due to be delivered to voters later this week, The Telegraph can reveal.It comes after the Conservatives warned that a vote for Reform risked putting Labour in power for “a generation”.The direct mail drive urging people to vote Tory is Mr Johnson’s closest involvement yet in the Conservatives’ attempts to defy the polls.The Prime Minister and Boris Johnson once had a close relationship, but it became increasingly strained after Rishi Sunak's resignation as chancellor in 2022 - Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesAmong those voters believed to have been targeted are wavering Tories who backed the party when Mr Johnson was leader but are now tempted by Reform.On Monday, the Conservatives issued their starkest warning over Nigel Farage’s party yet after the Reform manifesto launch, saying: “If you’re thinking about voting for Reform, and a generation under Labour scares you, there’s only one way to prevent it: vote Conservative.”In the last fortnight, there have been discussions about Mr Johnson appearing in person on the campaign trail to boost the party’s fortunes.He has not been in the UK, however, with Carrie Johnson, Mr Johnson’s wife, posting pictures on her Instagram on Monday night of the family on holiday in “beautiful Sardinia”.Photos show the former prime minister relaxing on a beach with his wife and children on the Italian coast.Carrie Johnson posted a holiday photo on InstagramIsaac Levido, the Tory campaign manager who also ran his 2019 election bid, is known to admire his former boss’s communication skills. Mr Levido and Mr Johnson have been in regular contact during the campaign, including about how the former prime minister could help out.But it remains unclear how much Mr Johnson is willing to do to support Mr Sunak, a man many of his allies still blame for his ousting from Downing Street.Mr Sunak’s resignation as chancellor in July 2022 triggered a ministerial stampede for the exit door, with Mr Johnson resigning 36 hours later.So far, Mr Johnson has limited his campaign role to video endorsements for individual MPs who have asked for them, and pro-Tory columns in the Daily Mail. But those articles often make no explicit mention of Mr Sunak, and the video support messages made public so far have tended to be for loyal allies.On Monday, another campaign video by Mr Johnson was released in which he urges people to vote for Alice Hopkin, the Tory candidate in Normanton and Hemsworth, to avoid handing Labour a ‘super majority’. He urges voters: “Don’t let Starmer get away with it.”Mr Sunak and Mr Johnson have not talked during the campaign, according to one Johnson ally, suggesting their relationship has not fully healed. They had shared texts about Israel-Gaza policy issues the day before the snap election was called.One ally of Mr Johnson told The Telegraph he was still weighing up whether to campaign in person. Asked why the Tory campaign wanted to deploy him, the source said: “The simple answer is he gets cut through. That is a rarity in this Conservative campaign.”Sources in both the Tory campaign and close to Mr Johnson dismissed any suggestion there was friction between the two camps. They stressed Mr Johnson had not turned down any specific offer to join a campaign event.One idea had been that that he would campaign in Red Wall seats that he won in 2019. In the past, his allies have said Mr Sunak would have to call and ask for his help.With limited time before the election, Mr Johnson’s overseas commitments complicate the situation. He travels abroad again this week and is due to return only shortly before polling day.He sees himself as an election winner and he may be reluctant to appear as part of a campaign facing defeat, especially should he ever wish to launch a political comeback. One ally predicted that he would not end up doing an in-person campaign event.The Tories are still trailing Labour by around 20 percentage points in the polls with less than three weeks before the general election on July 4. Some polling analysis suggests they could be left with under 100 MPs.Mr Sunak, under pressure after months without improvement in the polls, has faced calls from some Tories to “go for the jugular” in attacks on Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader.The campaign is now also talking up the prospect of a Labour “super-majority” to sway voters back to the Tories. But Mr Sunak has avoided personally talking about that possibility, insisting he can still win the election.A spokesman for Mr Johnson said: “Boris Johnson has always said ‘vote Conservative’ at every election, and he continues to say that this time.”"
The Independent,Nigel Farage pledges to run for PM in 2029 as Reform manifesto slated by economists,[],Archie Mitchell and David Maddox,18 June 2024 at 2:54 am·6-min read,18,June,2024,02:54:00,6,"Nigel Farage has parked his tank firmly on Rishi Sunak’s lawn with a manifesto designed to win over disgruntled Tory supporters and an extraordinary prediction he will be prime minister after the 2029 election.Launching Reform UK’s so-called “contract with the people”, the arch-Brexiteer appealed directly to right-wing voters with policies including a freeze on non-essential immigration, scrapping net zero targets and pulling Britain out of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).His controversial pledges came as one prospective candidate was forced to stand down over historical comments urging people to vote BNP, while another described Adolf Hitler as “brilliant”.Jack Aaron, who is standing against defence secretary Grant Shapps in Welwyn Hatfield, made comments online praising Hitler’s “brilliant tactics”, while Syrian president Bashar-al Assad was “gentle by nature”.While right-wingers revelled in Reform UK’s wishlist of pledges, economists and experts ripped it apart for its fantasy economics and dangerous high-carbon anti-net zero policies.Sam Fankhauser, professor of climate economics and policy at the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, University of Oxford, told The Independent: “Reform UK would like Britain to be a high-carbon island in a low-carbon world, missing out on 21st-century technology, innovation and growth. Our own research shows that the UK can meet its 2030 net zero targets with just six to eight billion pounds of additional public sector investment a year – a small price to pay for a liveable planet.”Meanwhile, the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) concluded that Reform’s sums “do not add up”.Reform UK chairman Richard Tice (left) and party leader Nigel Farage launch ‘Our Contract with You’ in Merthyr Tydfil on Monday (PA)IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson said the party’s planned spending cuts, such as its £50bn crackdown on “wasteful government spending”, would save less than stated, while the proposed tax cuts would cost tens of billions of pounds more.He added: “Even with the extremely optimistic assumptions about how much economic growth would increase, the sums in this manifesto do not add up. While Reform’s manifesto gives a clear sense of priority, a government could only implement parts of this package, or would need to find other ways to help pay for it, which would mean losers not specified.”The impact of Mr Farage on the campaign was underlined again as a Redfield and Wilton poll put Reform level with the Tories on 18 per cent, both well behind Labour on 43 per cent.But it all came as anti-Brexit campaign group Best for Britain said Labour could stop Mr Farage in his tracks with a potential victory in Clacton if the electorate votes tactically.Speaking ahead of the launch, the Reform leader said he was “launching a crusade to defend British values” and that the location was chosen “because it shows everyone exactly what happens to a country when Labour is in charge”.In a sign that Reform’s policy document was not a serious programme for government, Mr Farage opened the event in Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales, with an admission: “I’m not going to pretend we’re going to win.”Instead, he announced that the policies were issues his party planned to pursue in his self-appointed role as the “opposition to Labour” as part of a campaign to ensure he is prime minister after the 2029 election.Mr Farage lashed out at the soaring tax burden, touting £90bn per year worth of tax cuts for voters and a shake-up that would take 7 million people out of paying tax on their earnings altogether.Click here for our live coverage of the general election campaign.The manifesto launch comes just days after Reform overtook the Tories for the first time in a national poll. It is still expected to win just one seat, with Mr Farage standing in Clacton, but threatens to deprive the Tories of majorities in tens of seats across the country.In a sign of increasing panic over the rise of Reform in the polls, a Conservative Party spokesperson responded to the manifesto launch by saying a vote for Reform “risks delivering an unaccountable Labour majority”.They added: “That would hand Keir Starmer a blank cheque to raise your taxes, take no action on illegal immigration, and even rejoin the EU, with no way to stop him.”And the Tories warned that if Labour got in, it would remain in power for a generation.Nigel Farage was criticised for spending more in the Reform UK manifesto than Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-Budget (PA Archive)Reform said its manifesto pledges would cost £141bn to implement, setting out proposals to save £146bn to fund them.Tax expert Dan Neidle immediately noted that at least £38bn of Reform’s tax cuts were unfunded, about twice the unfunded cost of Liz Truss’s disastrous 2022 mini-Budget.But Mr Farage insisted the document showed “radical, fresh, outside-the-box thinking”.He said: “It’s not what you’re going to get from the current Labour and Conservative parties who are virtually indistinguishable, frankly, from each other.“Is this radical fresh thinking on economics? Yes. Is it radical fresh thinking on constitutional change? Yes. Is it a very radical change in the way our education system is currently bringing up our young children? Yes.”And, in a sign of Mr Farage’s package appealing to traditional Tory backers, the usually Conservative-supporting Taxpayers’ Alliance said the manifesto offered Brits “real relief”.Mr Farage addressed criticism of the cost of the package by saying the party would merely be campaigning for the measures over five years as the voice of opposition to an expected Labour government.The manifesto also delved into the so-called culture wars, promising a ban on “transgender ideology” in schools with “gender questioning, social transitioning and pronoun swapping” prohibited.Nigel Farage signs a copy of his party’s manifesto following its launch in Merthyr Tydfil (PA Wire)It also proposed a “patriotic curriculum”, which would include pairing the teaching of Britain’s history of slavery or European imperialism, with a non-European occurrence to “ensure balance”.Reform promised to make St George’s Day and St David’s Day public holidays, pledged a Free Speech Bill to “stop left-wing bias and politically correct ideology” and said it would scrap the TV licence, which funds the BBC. It also vowed to fast-track North Sea oil and gas licences.Mr Farage added that Reform wants to “simplify” the UK’s tax system, which it says totals more than 21,000 pages, while Hong Kong’s is 500 pages.The party is also proposing to lift the minimum profit threshold to £100,000 and reduce the main corporation tax rate from 25 per cent to 15 per cent in three years, which it says would “free” 1.2 million businesses.Elsewhere, it promises to abolish business rates for small and medium businesses by introducing an “online delivery tax” of 4 per cent for large companies.Mr Farage’s party also pledges to cut fuel duty by 20p per litre, scrap VAT on energy bills, scrap stamp duty on sales below £750,000 and ditch income tax for those earning less than £20,000.The document also states that inheritance tax would be scrapped for 98 per cent of all estates."
The Telegraph,Keir Starmer’s original sin has come back to haunt him,[],Patrick O'Flynn,18 June 2024 at 7:34 pm·3-min read,18,June,2024,07:34:00,3,"There is a famous internet meme in which David Beckham twice tells a dissembler to “be honest” before finally saying “thank you” after procuring a damning admission. It came readily to mind during Keir Starmer’s performance on LBC this morning, when he was asked if he would have served in Jeremy Corbyn’s Cabinet had Labour won the 2019 election.Starmer said the dilemma hadn’t crossed his mind “because I didn’t think we would win”. Then he branded the question “hypothetical”. Finally he admitted: “If we had got it over the line there were important things that I thought needed to be done from the frontbench.”Thank you. So that’s a “yes” then. This restyled Mr Moderate would have propped up the same former candidate for prime minister that he today damns as having been unfit to run Britain.Not only did he describe Corbyn as having the makings of “a great prime minister” during the 2019 campaign, but he also called his one-time boss a “friend” on multiple occasions, including during the 2020 leadership contest in which he was keen to come across as a Left-wing candidate. Starmer appears to have devised the “I knew we would lose” idea much later as a way of rationalising his own conduct to himself.One even feels a certain amount of sympathy for Corbyn’s hurt feelings when he observed of Starmer’s repositioning: “Well he never said that to me at any time. So I just think rewriting history is no help. It shows double standards, shall we say.”There can be no doubt that Starmer’s current line on Corbyn is the correct judgment. After all, who can forget Corbyn’s response after Russian special agent staged a chemical attack in Salisbury that ultimately killed a British citizen?In March 2018, he pressed then Prime Minister Theresa May to explain: “How has she responded to the Russian government’s request for a sample used in the Salisbury attack, to run its own tests?” The ludicrous implication was that he thought the Kremlin could be relied upon to truthfully say whether the nerve agent deployed had originated in Russia or not.On that occasion several Labour MPs, including Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn, intervened to support Mrs May against their own party leader. They spoke from the backbenches because they refused to serve under Corbyn.Starmer was by then one of Corbyn’s most important lieutenants, charged as Shadow Brexit Secretary with steering Labour’s approach to leaving the European Union. The plan he came up with, lest anyone forget, was to try and scrap Brexit via a second referendum, even though he had earlier promised that Labour would support the implementation of Brexit “as a matter of principle”.When it comes to the issue of people who are unfit to be prime minister of the United Kingdom, the only sensible conclusion about Starmer’s opinion of Corbyn should be: it takes one to know one"
The Telegraph,Over half of Tory activists think Sunak wrong to call summer election,[],Charles Hymas,18 June 2024 at 7:26 pm·2-min read,18,June,2024,07:26:00,2,"More than half of Tory activists opposed Rishi Sunak’s decision to call a snap summer election, a poll has shown. ‌The research, by ConservativeHome, showed that 58.7 per cent of Tory constituency members did not support the Prime Minister’s decision to call an election for July 4. ‌Under a third (31.24 per cent) supported the move, while 10.06 per cent said they did not know, according to the poll of 1,200 grassroots activists. ‌The results also showed that the announcement caught party by surprise, with many constituencies apparently unprepared to fight an election campaign. ‌Just 28 per cent of activists believed their local Tory association was ready to do so. More than half (51.77 per cent) said they did not believe their association was ready. Around one in five said they did not know. ‌In its commentary, ConservativeHome suggested voting may have been influenced by the Tory campaign’s troubled course, from Mr Sunak’s soaking in a thunderstorm outside Downing Street when he announced the date to his early departure from the D-Day commemorations in France. ‌“Under three in 10 of those surveyed believe their association was ready to fight the election. Since the election date surprised everyone from the Cabinet down, this can only be expected,” said ConservativeHome’s commentary. ‌“The subsequent row over candidates, allegations of CCHQ arrogance, and the general incompetence of the party machine will only add to impressions.”“Finally, only adding to the impression of chaos, only seven in 10 – 71.85 per cent – of the panel were certain their constituency had a candidate selected by the time the election was called on May 22.” ‌One in eight (13.33 per cent) reported their association did not have a candidate in place, whilst 14.81 per cent were unsure.Few Tories have spoken out publicly over the timing of the election although it has been claimed that Isaac Levido, Mr Sunak’s political strategist and the man charged with running the campaign, was opposed to a summer poll. ‌Prof Sir John Curtice, Britain’s foremost polling guru, said it was a mistake, while Baroness Davidson, a former leader of the Scottish Tories, suggested Mr Sunak could have avoided the return of Nigel Farage to front line politics by choosing to “go long” with an election in October or November."

Glasgow Times,Scottish Labour vow to make NHS secure in General Election manifesto,[],Morgan Carmichael,18 June 2024 at 8:00 pm·3-min read,18,June,2024,08:00:00,3,"The Scottish Labour Party have vowed to ensure the NHS is secure for “generations to come” as they launched their General Election manifesto today.The 135-page document largely echoes the proposals laid out in the UK-wide Labour manifesto published last week, but Anas Sarwar has also committed to some additional measures, should the party win the keys to Bute House.It comes as Mr Sarwar described change in Scotland as a “two-stage process” - also looking to 2026, when Scots will next go to the polls in a Holyrood election.(Image: Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar speaking during the party's General Election manifesto launch. Im)The manifesto vows to ensure the NHS is secure for “generations to come” and says that Scottish Labour will improve policing, reform the planning system, ban second jobs for MSPs, and reduce the poverty-related attainment gap in education if it forms the government in 2026.READ NEXT: Scottish Greens to propose ‘super tax’ in General Election manifestoIt comes after Scottish Labour said yesterday that the document draws mention to the mortgage guarantee scheme for first-time buyers, support for creative industries and banning zero-hours contracts.The party also pledged to “look after young people from cradle to career”.(Image: Images from PA, Jane Barlow)Mr Sarwar said: “The manifesto we have published today of course reflects much of what the UK Labour manifesto outlined last week, demonstrating what a UK Labour government will deliver in office.“But we know change for Scotland is a two-stage process, it begins in just 17 days when we can finally get rid of this lying, corrupt, incompetent Tory Government – but that is just the start.“The SNP has failed the people of Scotland – breaking our NHS, ruining our once world-leading education system, and tarnishing our politics by wasting and misusing your money.”Mr Sarwar went on to pledge that a Labour government will unlock Scotland's ""extraordinary"" potential.He said: “I know that Scotland has extraordinary potential just waiting to be unlocked – Labour will unlock that true potential.“We have worked tirelessly so that our party is ready to serve you again. Our country is crying out for change.""(Image: Images from PA, Jane Barlow)Following his speech, Mr Sarwar was repeatedly questioned about the two-child benefit cap – which limits the number of children families can claim benefits for.Labour has said it will not be able to scrap the measure due to a lack of funding, but it has come under pressure from opposition parties and campaigners.Asked by a journalist if he is against the cap, Mr Sarwar said: “The short answer is yes.“We were right to oppose the two-child limit, we were right to vote against the two-child limit.”READ NEXT: Scottish Liberal Democrats reveal General Election manifestoThe Scottish Liberal Democrats pledged to boost carer’s wages as as they launched their  Election manifesto yesterday. The document included plans to introduce a carer’s minimum wage with a £2 an hour boost, as well as fast-tracking access to mental health counsellors in schools.The party also said that an additional £1b in capital funding would come to Scotland through Barnett consequential which could be used to tackle the housing emergency and local health facilities across the country.Meanwhile, the Scottish Greens have said today that their manifesto, due to be released this week, will put forward plans to introduce a £1,000-per-head private jet tax, while John Swinney said the SNP will include a social tariff on energy, broadband and mobile bills in its manifesto - which launches on Wednesday."
The Independent,General election polls: Are Labour or the Conservatives on track to win in July?,[],Alicja Hagopian,18 June 2024 at 6:51 pm·3-min read,18,June,2024,06:51:00,3,"Prime minister Rishi Sunak settled on 4 July for the general election after months of speculation. But while the economic news is good, with inflation coming down, the polls are still heavily against the Tories.The last general election was in 2019, when Boris Johnson and the Tories won 365 seats, while Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour won 202. Since then, both parties have switched leaders — in some cases, more than once — not to mention Brexit coming into effect and a worldwide Coronavirus pandemic.So what are the polls saying? If Mr Sunak was hoping to wait for the polls to swing in his favour before calling the election, he was sorely mistaken.The general public has been overall dissatisfied with both the prime minister and Sir Starmer, with Ipsos polls showing negative net satisfaction consistently for both party leaders since Mr Sunak entered No. 10 in November 2022.Mr Sunak’s approval rating fell to the ranks of lowest-ever for a prime minister in April, at -59 per cent approval; matched only by John Major in August 1994. This is lower than Liz Truss, whose net approval rating was at -51 per cent for her brief stint as prime minister.Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour has a 24-point lead in the latest poll on voter intentions from Techne UK, with the Tory-Labour gap remaining as wide as ever.After a dip in the polls following Mr Sunak’s election announcement, the Tories have made little gains with voters.At just 20 per cent of the vote, the Conservatives are still at one of their lowest levels of popularity with the electorate under Mr Sunak.Meanwhile Reform UK have shot up to 15 per cent of the national vote, after being neck-in-neck with the Lib Dems for the past few months, and gunning for the spot of third-highest polling party.Both parties appear to be picking up support from historical Tory voters.Labour have polled consistently in the region of 44 per cent and the Conservatives have been shedding more points since January.Although it is not entirely clear why Mr Sunak chose now to go to the polls, one in four people believe that the prime minister was hoping to benefit from recently improved inflation figures, according to a Redfield and Wilton poll for the Independent.If that is the case, the Tories have seen no joy when it comes to voter intention.The latest data is taken from 1,630 surveyed individuals across the UK, weighted to be representative of the population.Satisfaction with both Mr Sunak and Sir Keir remains poor, according to a separate monthly poll by Ipsos UK.The data is taken from 1,000 British adults surveyed each month, answering the question: “Are you satisfied/dissatisfied with how ... is doing his job as prime minister/as leader of the Labour Party?”Despite low figures overall, satisfaction has jumped for the Labour leader in the past month, with a 13-point boost from -31 per cent to -18 per cent.Mr Sunak saw a 5-point jump in the same period, from -59 per cent to -55 per cent. This puts Mr Starmer at a 37-point lead in net satisfaction.An exclusive Independent poll from Redfield and Wilton shows that the economy tops the list of issues that are most important to voters, at 37 per cent. With inflation finally slowing down (at 2.3 per cent as of May), the economy could be a key button for the Tories to press; if the general public can look beyond the past two years.Meanwhile, healthcare is the most important issue for 1 in 5 voters at this election, in the wake of widespread strikes, pandemic strains, and scandals across the NHS including the infected blood inquiry and sky-high waiting lists.Migration is also a dividing concern among voters, with both Labour and the Tories pledging to cut numbers."
PA Media: UK News,Sunak: Tories can win General Election but people’s frustration ‘undeniable’,[],PA Political Staff,18 June 2024 at 2:23 am·5-min read,18,June,2024,02:23:00,5,"Rishi Sunak has insisted the Tories can still win the General Election after Cabinet minister Grant Shapps said a Conservative victory is unlikely.The Prime Minister said he understands people’s frustrations but gave a more optimistic assessment of his party’s chances than the Defence Secretary, who said that to claim the Tories are on course for a win would be to “try and pretend black is white”.As the party continues to languish behind Labour in the polls, he said Sir Keir Starmer lacked “the courage of his convictions” and suggested his rival would find the job in Downing Street “hard to do well”.Asked during a huddle with journalists on the Tory battlebus about what he thought of his political opponent, the Prime Minister said: “What I’d say is Keir Starmer is someone who clearly doesn’t have the courage of his convictions.“He also is not prioritising investment in our country’s security. I think that is deeply concerning as someone who’s sat in this job for 18 months, at a time when the world is more dangerous and uncertain than it’s been since the end of the Cold War, having just come back from the G7 and a peace summit about Ukraine in Switzerland.“It’s obvious that the world is incredibly dangerous and for someone who wants to be prime minister of our country not to prioritise investing more our country’s security I find deeply concerning.”Mr Sunak’s comments came as Nigel Farage launched Reform UK’s “contract” with voters to add to the Conservatives’ woes.Labour has an average 20-point poll lead over the past week – on 41% ahead of the Tories on 21% and Reform on 15%.Speaking during a visit to a Centrica gas rig earlier on Monday, the Prime Minister said: “There’s still two-and-a-half weeks to go in this election, I’m fighting hard for every vote because I believe we can win.“And there’s a very clear choice at this election: it’s having your taxes cut by the Conservatives or facing significant tax rises with the Labour Party.”(PA Graphics)Asked if he understands people’s frustrations with the Tory Party, with some voters deciding to turn to Reform UK, he replied: “Of course I understand people’s frustrations with that – I mean that’s undeniable, and I’ve been very clear that we have made progress, but there is more to go.“But the point now is we are on the right track and this election is about the future.”Mr Shapps earlier told Times Radio it is “possible to win the election”, but conceded it is “not the most likely outcome”, adding: “I’m a realist.”Asked if a Tory victory is unlikely, he replied: “I think that’s the realistic position, isn’t it? I mean, I live in the real world. So, you know, let’s not try and pretend black is white.”Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer and shadow chancellor Rachel Reeve on a visit to Southampton (Stefan Rousseau/PA)Meanwhile, Labour accused Jeremy Hunt of “admitting” pledges in the Conservative manifesto are “completely unfunded” after the BBC reported the Chancellor last week said that promised tax cuts would be funded by savings from a back-to-work programme announced in the autumn statement.In a sign of the campaign intensifying as it enters its fourth week, shadow paymaster general Jonathan Ashworth put a copy of the Tory document into a shredder at a hastily arranged press conference in London, claiming that is what Mr Hunt had done to the Conservatives’ economic credibility.The Tories have set out plans for billions in tax cuts, which they claim would be paid for by £12 billion of savings on welfare.Mr Sunak’s visit to a Centrica platform in the North Sea came as Mr Farage was setting out Reform’s plans – which he suggested were the first step on the path to a potential election win in 2029.Mr Farage added: “Our ambition is to establish a bridgehead in Parliament, and to become a real opposition to a Labour government.”He said the Tories would not be able to provide opposition because “they spend most of their days arguing among themselves, and they’re split down the middle when it comes to policy”.In other developments:– Reform set out a four-point plan for immigration including: leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, allowing zero illegal immigrants to settle in the UK, establishing a new “Department of Immigration” and returning migrants who come over in boats to France.– Labour claimed Chancellor Jeremy Hunt had driven a “coach and horses” through the Tory’s manifesto promises by saying that a £12 billion squeeze on welfare which the Conservatives plan to use to fund tax cuts had already been announced and factored in to the existing government finances.– Scotland’s First Minister John Swinney said the SNP will include a social tariff on energy, broadband and mobile bills in its manifesto this week.Labour intends to spend the week focusing on its plans for the economy, with shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves joining Sir Keir on the campaign trail.Sir Keir used a visit to a port in Southampton to say that a renegotiated Brexit deal could remove “an inhibitor” to economic growth.Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves and shadow secretary of state for business and trade Jonathan Reynolds met business leaders on Monday morning at the start of a campaign week focusing on the economy (Lucy North/PA)He said: “We took a decision to leave the EU, so we are not going to go back in. But we think the deal we’ve got is botched, it’s not good enough and I think many businesses would say: ‘We need something that works better for us.'”Ms Reeves used a Financial Times interview to suggest she would seek to revise parts of Boris Johnson’s 2020 Brexit deal by seeking closer alignment with EU rules in the chemicals and veterinary sectors, better touring rights for UK artists, and greater mutual recognition of qualifications for financial services workers.The Labour frontbencher also pledged to “hit the ground running to show that Britain is open for business” by holding a global investment summit in the first 100 days of entering government.She met members of her British infrastructure council on Monday morning to discuss attracting foreign investors who have been put off by political instability in the UK."
