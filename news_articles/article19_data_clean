Exactly a week later, the populist politician had objects thrown at him from a construction site in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, while riding on an open top deck of a campaign bus.While Farage was unharmed, he told ITV News after the first incident that being pelted in the face by a stranger with an unknown liquid was nonetheless ""quite frightening"".What security do MPs receive and how much does it cost?MPs from across the political spectrum have reported serious threats to their security, with the volume of such cases increasing over the past decade, according to the Institute for Government think tank.Data published by the Metropolitan Police showed the number of alleged crimes against MPs in London had risen from 151 in 2017 to 342 in 2018 – an increase of 126%, while a BBC survey in 2019 found that over 60% of MPs who responded had reported threats to police in the previous year.All MPs are advised to take routine security measures, while others may receive ""enhanced"" or ""further"" security measures in response to individual circumstances, particularly if police have recommended them.Until April 2023, both forms of measures were funded by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), which sets and regulates the payment of MPs’ pay, pensions and business costs.However, since April 2023, routine security measures are funded via accommodation and office cost expenses that MPs can claim from IPSA, while the House of Commons itself pays for further security measures.As for how much it costs, the best available data we have is from before the changes to the rules in April 2023, based on IPSA's security assistance budget.It says that in 2022/23, total spending was £3.3m, which was slightly lower than the £4.4m paid in 2020/21 and 2021/22, but was still 80 times higher than the amount spent in 2010/11.In early 2016, following threats made to MPs over Parliamentary debates on military action in Syria, the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) recommended that all MPs adopt a package of security measures.Concerns continued to rise from then, with the murder of Jo Cox in June 2016, followed by a terror attack outside the Houses of Parliament in March 2017, with funding rising significantly since then.In February 2024 the government announced a £31m package aimed at boosting MPs' security, with prime minister Rishi Sunak claiming there is a ""growing consensus that mob rule is replacing democratic rule"".The government has said that this money will be used to ensure that all elected representatives and election candidates will have a named contact in the police with whom to discuss security matters.It says the funding package will be used to enhance police capabilities, boost private sector security provisions for those facing a higher risk and to increase cyber security advice to locally elected representatives.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

Yahoo News UK,Who will win the next general election? Latest polls and oddsThree new polls have each projected a seismic victory for Labour - with one even suggesting Rishi Sunak could lose his seat.,"[""Tories to slump to lowest number of seats since party's formation"", 'Conservatives on course for worst defeat in over a century', 'Sunak to lose seat in Tory wipeout, major poll predicts', 'What are the latest odds?', 'What went wrong for the Tories?']",James Cheng-Morris and  James Hockaday,Updated 19 June 2024 at 1:08 pm·8-min read,19,June,2024,01:08:00,8,"Three polls released in the space of an hour have indicated that Rishi Sunak is on course for a crushing defeat in the upcoming general election - with one report suggesting he could become the first sitting prime minister to lose his seat.The polls published on Wednesday evening were commissioned by the Telegraph, Sky and the News Agents podcast. All the polls use the multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP) technique, which enables projections to be made at constituency level.And while all three polls indicate Sunak faces an uphill battle to avoid a major defeat, there is a significant disparity from all three as to how far ahead Keir Starmer actually is.Yahoo summaries the key points of the three pollsTories to slump to lowest number of seats since party's formationYouGov's polling for Sky News projects Labour is on course to achieve a 200-seat majority. Labour is predicted to secure 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.This projection would show the Tories plummeting from the 365 won by Boris Johnson in the 2019 election and give the party their lowest ever number of MPs. It would also give Starmer more seats than the 418 won by Tony Blair in 1997. Read a full report of this poll from Sky NewsThe YouGov poll for Sky News.Conservatives on course for worst defeat in over a centuryAccording to polling by More In Common UK for the News Agents podcast, Labour is projected to finish on 406 seats, a majority of 162. The Conservatives would lose more than half their MPs to 155. The Liberal Democrats would quadruple their number of MPs to 49, while the SNP would be left with 18 seats.

This polling puts Labour on a massive 516 seats, with the Tories on only 53 - just in front of the Lib Dems on 50 - a forecast that would be remarkable were it to be reflected on polling night. According to the Telegraph, this is the first poll to project more than 500 seats for Labour and would be a truly astonishing result were it to happen.

Given the nature of these seat totals, it is natural to be slightly sceptical.""It adds: ""Not every MRP is the same. The statistical 'building blocks' used to model voter behaviour will vary from pollster to pollster, which will in turn lead to different vote shares and seat totals. All different pollsters will get different national vote share.""The MRP methodology, as described by YouGov, ""uses data at the constituency level to predict the outcomes of seats based on the concentration of various different types of voters who live there"".Stuart Wilks-Heeg, writing in The Conversation earlier this month, points out some of the other limitations of MRP polling: ""There are ... factors MRPs cannot take into account. Some constituency results will be influenced by locally specific issues that statistical models can’t capture. For example, adjustments cannot be made for who the candidates are in each constituency and whether any have a profile that could enhance, or detract from, their party’s chance of winning. Think Nigel Farage standing for Reform UK in Clacton.""And competing MRPs produce contrasting outcomes because each model uses specific assumptions and data. Different inputs produce different outputs. This election has seen more MRPs produced than ever before, and from various organisations. In the early hours of July 5, we’ll know which one came closest to getting the result correct.""What are the latest odds?As of 19 June, Oddschecker – a website which compares odds across different bookmakers – had Labour at 1/41 to win the most seats. To put that in context, this is seen as so likely that a £10 bet would return just £10.24.The Conservatives are 40/1 to win the most seats, a scenario seen as so unlikely that a £10 punt would return £410.What went wrong for the Tories?YouGov's voting intention tracker between January 2020 and June 2024. (YouGov)So, why have the polls changed so dramatically? It's worth looking back on an extremely eventful four-and-a-half years in UK politics.According to YouGov's voting intention tracker (see chart, above), Tory support peaked at 53%, with Labour on 32%, in April 2020, months after the party's stunning success in the 2019 general election and Boris Johnson's pledge to “get Brexit done”. That month also saw Starmer take over as Labour leader from Jeremy Corbyn.This was also amid a spirit of national unity following the onset of the COVID pandemic which nearly killed Johnson himself. The then-PM had been released from hospital five days before this particular survey was taken.Boris Johnson delivers his final speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street in September 2022. (AFP via Getty Images)Over the rest of the year, there was a downturn in support amid chaos over COVID rules, with the Tories falling as low as 35% in November 2020, compared to Labour on 40%.However, the UK’s successful COVID vaccination programme provided a pathway out of lockdown and with it, improved poll ratings. Tory support peaked at 41% in June 2021, with Labour at 30%.In October that year, there was a sense Johnson was untouchable. At the Tory party conference, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg remarked how the PM was ""in total command of his party, and politically dominant in the country"".But this fell apart quickly with the Partygate scandal, which emerged in November that year. Time and again, reports emerged of government and Tory staff – including Johnson – having taken part in lockdown-era social gatherings when their own COVID rules had prohibited them.By January 2022, Tory support had plummeted to 28%, with Labour on 38%. Johnson struggled on, but never recovered and a wave of ministerial resignations forced him to resign in July that year.The UK had three separate prime ministers – Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak – between 6 September and 24 October, 2022. (Getty Images)His successor, Liz Truss, then embarked on arguably the most disastrous prime ministerial reign in history, characterised by the catastrophic ""mini-budget"", containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, which prompted an economic crisis. Like Johnson, she lost the confidence of Tory MPs – and voters – and had to resign.Her 49-day spell as PM was the shortest in history, with Tory support plummeting to 19% (with Labour on 56%) the day after she announced her resignation in October 2022.Rishi Sunak, who had lost to Truss in the previous month's Tory leadership election, took over. However, as the above YouGov chart indicates, he has failed to cut through with voters. Tory support was at 23% two days after he assumed office, with the most recent survey, carried out on Thursday, showing support is now lower than under Truss at 18%.In short, the polls and odds, not to mention other factors such as notable by-election victories for Starmer's Labour, are pointing to a Labour government next month.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

The Telegraph,Brace yourself for Starmer’s war on life’s great pleasures,[],Tim Stanley,23 June 2024 at 10:00 pm·5-min read,23,June,2024,10:00:00,5,"This is how the Conservative world ends, not with a bang but a flutter. The Tories in office were gamblers, shaggers, nutters and clowns, but at least they were funny – and their wrist too limp to grasp power entirely. Now the cavaliers are leaving the stage; here come the roundheads. Brace yourselves for a war on joy.The most significant moment in this campaign was when Keir Starmer got angry about people laughing at his hundredth recital of the “daddy was a toolmaker” line. He couldn’t grasp that they were laughing at him, not his father. Though some will assume his fury was concocted to save face, what little we know suggests it was 100 per cent real.The Tories have never understood the man. They call him Corbyn in disguise, a commie dressed as a Blairite – and thus every attack line fails because voters can sense it’s not true. He’s a hawk on war; a tough guy on security. There’s no grand plan to redistribute power and wealth. Keir’s character is conservative: calm and honourable, concerned less with method of government than style, with shades of Ted Heath’s “to govern is to serve”. He likes beer, 1980s music and football. He had a strained relationship with his dad, which fascinates touchy-feely media types but is familiar to those of us whose fathers were “present but not involved”. And he self-defines as working class to emphasise he’s the very opposite of Corbyn, that while the radical Left is motored by ideas, he is all about biography – a “lived experience” that super-rich Rishi could never understand.Starmer is exciting, says Labour, because he is boring. So boring he could be an android. In a recent interview, he said he didn’t have a favourite novel or poem, and wasn’t afraid of anything as a child. Asked by a journalist desperate for colour what he dreamt of last night, he replied, “I don’t dream” (not even of electric sheep). He goes to bed at 11, passes out and wakes at 5am.Want to know how he’ll govern? Look at how he’s silenced and expelled the Labour Left. Listen to his highly personal attacks on his opponents: Rishi is a liar, Boris was “a pathetic spectacle of a man”, “without shame” and “ridiculous”, His preferred tone is sanctimonious, which in No 10 will quickly become tedious.The Left is always over-earnest. It can deploy humour as a weapon, but the reason why its efforts at satire are never truly funny is because they are uni-directional, the gags at service to a crusade that is almost unconsciously religious. “Joking aside,” they’d like to say, “the Tories are pure evil.” And one must never discount the possibility that the old crone at the edge of the village really is a witch.See, the great divide in British history isn’t Right v Left but cavalier v roundhead, a historic war between those who think life is a mess but we should try to enjoy it versus those who see it as a deadly serious struggle to build heaven on earth. Starmer looks unoriginal because he’s not here to start a revolution, he’s here to complete one. For decades, perhaps centuries, we’ve been eradicating our traditional order to build something egalitarian, bureaucratic and politically correct –though we’ve hitherto permitted a little bit of extra wealth or freedom or Ruritanian camp as a nod to how things used to be. Those are the relics that Labour’s puritans find most offensive. They are what will be swept away.The Lords has no teeth anymore, but it must go. Foxes cannot be chased, but even drag hunting will end. Private schooling is already exclusive, but Starmer will make it prohibitive (grammars and home-schooling will be next). Gentlemen’s clubs will be encouraged to admit women. Shrunken heads will be returned with a letter of apology. The CofE can bumble on because it’s Labour at prayer anyway, but the last vestiges of Christian ethics will be erased from the law books – abortion decriminalised, suicide to be assisted – as a new moral paradigm is clinically entrenched. You know what’s coming: rainbow flags everywhere, ministers reeling off pronouns, the Equality Act expanded, gender nonsense endorsed.The next government will also go to war on the car, declare a climate emergency, discourage meat, scream at smokers that they’re going to Hell, and chip away at property. No, Starmer won’t raise the big three taxes; that would hurt productivity. But he implied in his definition of “working people” – those who cannot write a cheque – that idle wealth is a decadent luxury.Charles I collected Van Dycks. Cromwell sold them off. And, if the Labour super-majority were so inclined, it would ban maypoles and Christmas puddings.If you want a vision of the future, remember lockdown – an attempt to make the country do the “right thing”, with the noblest of intentions but demoralising and destructive. And absolutely no laughing at the back.Whatever gimmicks are tried by Labour, no matter how comically they go wrong, critics will be accused of frivolity – of insufficient concern for the public’s welfare. The second most significant moment of the election campaign was when Sunak admitted to a diet of Haribo and Twix, and an angry caller demanded to know why he was making light of tooth decay.Britain is going to be run by people like that for five long years."
Yahoo News UK,Who is Ed Davey? Lib Dem leader attracts attention with election stuntsEverything you need to know about the former minister who has pledged to fight for the NHS.,[],Hannah Fearn,7 June 2024 at 11:47 am·7-min read,7,June,2024,11:47:00,7,"Ed Davey has been involved in a number of comedy stunts since the election was called. (Alamy) With the spotlight on prime minister Rishi Sunak and Labour leader Keir Starmer as they prepare to slug it out in a general election campaign, the focus had started slipping from Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey until a series of stunts put him back in the spotlight.The former coalition government cabinet minister - who lost his seat, punished by voters for getting into bed with the Tories, but then won it back again - is sending a clear message that he should not be overlooked.He’s had a long political career and the climax may still be ahead: if polls continue to shift away from the Conservatives at the current trajectory, there’s a slim possibility that, if the election is held in October, he could end up as Leader of the Opposition.So what do we know about the man behind the third party in British politics? Hannah Fearn finds out.His early lifeEd Davey was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on Christmas Day in 1965. He was the youngest of three boys, but lost his father at just four years old, and his mother followed over a decade later when he was in his mid-teens. She spent three years battling cancer, during which time he nursed his mother together with his grandmother and brother Henry.Once a keen Scout and Air Scout, he later remembers feeling “isolated” at school because of his caring responsibilities, which meant he couldn’t take part in after-school activities or sports. “The last 18 months she was bedridden and in a lot of pain. I’d spend hours on the bed, talking to her,” he said. Davey was with his mother when she died at Nottingham General Hospital, after being placed on an unsuited dementia ward.After both his parents had died, Davey was brought up by his maternal grandparents in the village of Eakring, though his grandfather died soon after. He spent much of his childhood and young adulthood close to his grandmother. “First of all, she was looking after me. Then we were looking after each other,” he said.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

Gasson stood in four elections but failed to win a seat and is now a councillor. The pair have two children, a son and daughter.Their son, born in 2007 and now a teenager, is disabled with a neurological condition. He attended special schools but is now educated at home with a tutor - a change that Davey said led to him becoming verbal for the first time. He has spoken about his anxiety about who will care for his son when he and his wife are no longer around. “It’s the thing that worries me more than anything else in my life,” he said.Gasson was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in 2012. She was well for many years following her diagnosis, but declined during lockdown and is working on recovering her physical strength.Liberal Democrats election broadcast shows Ed Davey with his son. (Liberal Democrats)His parentsHis father, John, was a solicitor and his mother, Nina, a teacher. Davey has described how he was inspired to study by his mother, who always wanted him to try hard academically and who he wanted to impress.His educationDavey attended the private Nottingham High School, the alma mater of former chancellor Kenneth Clarke. He became head boy, with Labour MP Ed Balls - who was studying in the year below - watching on. After school, he achieved a first class degree in philosophy, politics and economics at Jesus College, Oxford where he was junior common room president. After becoming an economics research for the Liberal Democrats he returned to study, reading for a master’s degree in economics at Birkbeck College, London.Ed Davey, pictured with his family. (Liberal Democrats)Why is he a sir?For three years, the Lib Dem leader was a member of the cabinet during the period of Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, holding the post of secretary of state for energy and climate change from 2012 to 2015. He was knighted in the 2016 New Year’s Honours for “political and public services”.Davey on... the cost of living crisisDavey has repeatedly attacked the government for failing to curb rapid inflation and the devastating effect it is having on household budgets. He called the Conservative Party “so out of touch they might as well be living on another planet”, and said he warned Jeremy Hunt “people are desperate for real help… but all the chancellor could offer is empty words and unfair tax hikes”. In particular, he has urged more action on food price inflation, which analysis from his own party found had risen 37 per cent in one year for the average weekly supermarket trip. He has promised to end energy hikes and abandoned his plan to add 1p to income tax to save the NHS because ordinary voters can no longer afford it.Davey on... the NHSThe Liberal Democrats have made the NHS a cornerstone of their policy platform for the last five years. In Davey’s words: “Voting Conservative is bad for your health.” He promises to reverse cuts to GP numbers and guarantee a doctor’s appointment when you need one, improve access to NHS dentistry and save lives by tackling ambulance call out delays. Davey blames the care crisis for deepening the problems of the health service and says his party would spend £5bn a year on a “care package” to ensure patients are discharged from hospital more quickly, freeing up bed space. However, there is little detail on how this would be financed without raising taxes on the wealthiest - which Davey has promised not to do in his push to poach disillusioned Tory voters.British Leader of the Liberal Democrats party Ed Davey arrives at the BBC Broadcasting House, for his appearance on 'Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg', in London, Britain, April 28, 2024. REUTERS/Maja SmiejkowskaDavey on... immigrationThe Lib Dem leader has been a long-standing advocate for refugee rights and critic of the government’s immigration policy. He has called for Conservative plans to deport failed asylum seekers to Rwanda a “cynical distraction” from the partygate crisis and the money would be better spent on measures to tackle the cost of living crisis. He added: “They’ve provided no evidence to suggest that this new policy will stop illegal smuggling, they’re not cracking down on the organised crime gangs, which is what you need to do.” He has called for a new right to work for refugees and asylum seekers, and major reform of the Home Office which he says is no longer up to the job. After the end of the coalition government, Davey has said his party “was wrong” to go along with the introduction of a minimum income standard for immigrants. He later described the policy as “nasty and unfair”.Davey on... the Post Office scandalDespite the Horizon scandal that led to the wrongful prosecution of more than 700 subpostmasters crossing the tenure of more than a dozen business secretaries, Ed Davey has recently taken the heat for failing to investigate the issue while he was in the job.It has emerged that Davey initially rejected a request to meet justice campaigner Alan Bates, and later accepted it only on the advice that it would be good for his PR.

PA Media: UK News,Sunak warns Labour government would be ‘disaster’ as he battles to save campaign,[],"David Hughes, PA Political Editor",24 June 2024 at 3:13 am·4-min read,24,June,2024,03:13:00,4,"Rishi Sunak will warn that it would take decades to recover from the “disaster” of a Labour government as he seeks to rally Tories to fight for every vote in the closing stages of the General Election campaign.The Prime Minister will tell activists they have just 10 days to “take our message to every corner of the United Kingdom” before polls open on July 4.With the Conservatives still around 20 points behind in the polls and after a bruising few days dominated by allegations about alleged insider betting, Mr Sunak will urge Tories not to “surrender” to Sir Keir Starmer’s party.The Prime Minister will launch the Scottish Tory manifesto and address a campaign event in London at the start of the last full week of campaigning.His latest intervention comes with him under pressure from within the Conservative Party to take a tougher stance against those being investigated by the Gambling Commission for betting on the election date.According to extracts of his speech briefed to the Daily Mail, Mr Sunak will say: “We have 10 days to take our message to every corner of the United Kingdom.“To make the argument that this country needs lower taxes, not £2,000 more taxes for every working family.“To make the case that a Labour government would be bad for our country, and an unchecked Labour government would be a disaster from which it would take decades to recover.”(PA Graphics)Labour has repeatedly denied Tory claims that it is planning to increase taxes on working families.But Mr Sunak will say: “When a politician won’t tell you what they are going to do, it means that they know you won’t like it.“All their evasions tell you is that they are going to whack up council tax and a bunch of other taxes.“And one thing we know about Keir Starmer is that he has no problem going back on his promises. His career is a story of commitments dropped as soon as they became too difficult to keep.“I tell you this: once you have handed Keir Starmer and Labour a blank cheque, you won’t be able to get it back.”In an attempt to boost Tory morale, Mr Sunak will say: “Don’t surrender to Labour. Fight for every vote, fight for our values, fight for our vision of Britain.”The Conservative campaign has been plunged into a deeper crisis by the gambling controversy, with the party’s chief data officer Nick Mason understood to be taking a leave of absence amid claims he placed bets on the election date.Director of campaigning Tony Lee has also taken a leave of absence, while Mr Lee’s would-be MP wife Laura Saunders and fellow candidate Craig Williams, who was a parliamentary aide to the Prime Minister, are also under investigation by the Gambling Commission.Home Secretary James Cleverly said he was not aware of any ministers caught up in the betting row (Lucy North/PA)With speculation at Westminster about how wide the inquiry might go, Home Secretary James Cleverly faced questions about whether ministers – potentially even in the Cabinet – had placed bets on the surprise summer election.Asked if ministers had bet on the date, he told the BBC: “Not to my knowledge.”Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove compared the impact of the row with the Partygate scandal.“It looks like one rule for them and one rule for us,” he told the Sunday Times, adding: “That’s the most potentially damaging thing.”Mr Gove went on to suggest it was “just not acceptable” for those in a “privileged position” close to the Prime Minister to use what he described as “inside information to make additional money for yourself”.Former justice secretary Sir Robert Buckland suggested Mr Sunak should have taken a tougher line and suspend those caught up in the row.“I do expect everybody to uphold the highest standards,” he told LBC Radio. ”I’m deeply hurt and rather angry that this has happened in the middle of a campaign that is tough enough without things like this to complicate it further.”Former Tory whip Anne Milton told Times Radio: “Suspension is the right thing to do while people are investigated. It’s harsh … if the allegations are found not to be true, but that is what would happen in any other sphere of work.”Mr Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer will face questions from Sun readers on Monday afternoon in the latest set piece of the election campaign.Labour is set to focus on health issues, raising concerns about “DIY dentistry” because of a lack of NHS treatment.Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: “It’s virtually impossible to get a dentist appointment after 14 years of Conservative neglect.“People are resorting to pulling their own teeth out – DIY dentistry should be the stuff of Charles Dickens’ books, not Britain in 2024.”"
The Independent,Everything we know about Tory election betting scandal,[],Matt Mathers,24 June 2024 at 2:42 am·5-min read,24,June,2024,02:42:00,5,"Rishi Sunak’s election campaign was dealt another blow on Sunday after it emerged that a fourth Conservative was being investigated over a bet on the date of the general election.Nick Mason, the party’s data chief, has taken a leave of absence after becoming the latest Tory to be reportedly investigated by the Gambling Commission for allegedly betting on the timing of the election before the date had been announced.The latest allegations were published by The Sunday Times, which claimed dozens of bets had been placed with potential winnings worth thousands of pounds. A spokesman for the official told the paper that he denied wrongdoing.What are the rules for MPs and others on betting with inside knowledge?Using confidential information to gain an unfair advantage when betting may constitute a criminal offence.Gamblers are not allowed to use inside information to place a bet or to instruct someone else to do so on their behalf.They are also not allowed to pass inside information on to someone else which they use for betting.Laura Saunders (Laura Saunders)Additionally, the MPs’ code of conduct bars members from “causing significant damage to the reputation and integrity of the house”.An MP placing a bet with inside knowledge is likely to cross this threshold.Who else is being investigated?Craig Williams, the PM’s parliamentary private secretary, was the first person caught up in the scandal.He admitted placing a bet on the election prior to Mr Sunak’s announcement after he was approached by a journalist.The 39-year-old Tory candidate for Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr placed a £100 bet with 5-1 odds at Ladbrokes, meaning he would have won £500, but his name was raised as potentially a “politically exposed person”, so the wager was not registered.That sparked the Gambling Commission writing to firms demanding the details of all bets made on a July election after 1 May, which it is now combing through. It is now believed to have widened its search beyond MPs and candidates to their friends and relatives as well.Bookmakers are particularly cautious over “novelty” betting markets such as the general election.According to The Guardian, which first reported the story, Mr Williams placed his bet via an online account that would have required him to provide personal details, including his date of birth and debit card. The bookmaker also knows the location of the bet.Ladbrokes declined to comment on the incident but the Gambling Commission issued a statement confirming that it was investigating.Mr Williams apologised after admiting that he had placed a wager on the bet, but refused to comment further while the GC carried out its probe.“I clearly made a huge error of judgment, that’s for sure, and I apologise,” he told. “I will not be expanding on my statement because it’s an independent process.”Laura Saunders became the second person to be named in the affair.Ms Saunders, the Tory candidate for Bristol North West, is also under investigation by the Gambling Commission (GC) over claims she may have had inside knowledge about the prime minister’s decision to call a snap poll for 4 July.Ms Saunders has worked for the party since 2015 and was married to Tony Lee, who works as the Conservative Party’s director of campaigns. Mr Lee has since taken a leave of absence after it came to light he was the third person being probed by the GC.According to the BBC, which first named Ms Saunders as the candidate under investigation, she worked most recently at the party’s international division at Conservative Campaign Headquarters, which works with other centre-right parties around the world.Close protection officer arrestedA police officer in Mr Sunak’s close protection team was arrested and suspended over alleged bets about the timing of the general election.The police constable from the Met’s Royalty and Specialist Protection Command was arrested on 17 June on suspicion of misconduct in public office after the betting watchdog contacted the force last Friday.The officer was taken into custody and bailed pending further enquiries, with the case being referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, according to the Met.What have senior Tories said about the scandal?Mr Sunak said it was “very disappointing” news that Mr Williams was being investigated by the GC.“Well, it’s very disappointing news and you would have seen Craig Williams say that it was a huge error of judgement,” he told broadcasters at the G7 summit earlier in June.After further revelations, Mr Sunak said he would sack anyone found guilty of wrongdoing.“These investigations are ongoing … one of them is a criminal investigation that’s being conducted by the police,” he told the BBC Question Time Leaders Special general election debate. “What I can tell you is if anyone is found to have broken the rules, not only should they face the full consequences of the law, I will make sure that they are booted out of the Conservative Party.”Michael Gove, the outgoing cabinet minister, said it would be “reprehensible” to use inside information to bet on the general election date.“If people have used inside information to place bets, that is deeply wrong,” he told the BBC on Thursday morning after Ms Saunders’s case came to light.“What I can’t do is sort of get too much into the detail of the case while an investigation is going on.“But I can talk about the broad principle and you’re absolutely right, it’s reprehensible.”After Mr Mason was named the fourth Tory under investigation, Mr Gove likened the controversy to the Partygate scandal, saying it looked like there is “one rule for them and one rule for us”."

Many also assume his title is hereditary.So what do you really need to know about the man who, on current poll ratings, is set to be the UK’s next prime minister?His early lifeKeir Starmer was born in Southwark, south London, in 1962, as the second of four children. His parents were Labour Party members and named him after Keir Hardie, the party’s first leader in parliament.The family moved out of the capital and he grew up in Hurst Green, a village just outside the small Surrey town of Oxted. He was active in youth politics from his teenage years but was also a skilled musician, taking music lessons alongside Norman Cook, who later became better known as a member of The Housemartins and the DJ Fatboy Slim.Starmer played the flute, piano, violin and recorder and was a junior exhibitioner at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.His familyStarmer is married to Victoria, a former solicitor who later retrained in occupational health and now works for the NHS. The pair met through their work in the law in the early 2000s and married in Essex in 2007.She was first seen accompanying her husband when the couple were filmed clapping for carers during the pandemic in 2020 outside their home in Camden. They have two children, a son and daughter, but both are kept out of the public eye.Victoria's father was Jewish and originally came from Poland, while her mother converted when they got married. Starmer has said in a previous interview that ""my wife in particular wants our children to know the faith of her family"" and that they ""observe some of the practices, for example Friday night prayers"".Keir Starmer with parents, Rodney and Josephine, at his graduation. (Twitter/Keir Starmer)His parentsThe Labour leader's father, Rodney Starmer, worked as a toolmaker in a factory, and his mother Josephine Starmer (née Baker), was a nurse.His father worked long, 14-hour days but spent his time outside work caring for Josephine, who was diagnosed with the autoimmune condition Still’s disease. She required two hip and knee replacements twice in her lifetime and struggled with arthritic pain.As a young man Starmer also helped care for his mother, which he has said led to him being more emotionally reserved. His sister, Katy, recalled: “He’s had to be a grown-up all his life. I’ve always been quite open about my feelings – Keir is good at most things, but not that.” Josephine Starmer died in 2015, and his father three years later.His educationStarmer passed the 11-plus examination, and attended Reigate Grammar School from age 11. While he was at the school it became an independent fee-paying institution, but as an existing student he was exempt from fees, and his tuition in the sixth form was covered by a bursary.After school he studied law at the University of Leeds, this first in his family to attend university, graduating with a first class degree in 1985. He undertook postgraduate law studied at the University of Oxford, where he served as editor of a radical magazine, Socialist Alternatives.A photograph of a younger Starmer as shown on ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories in 2021. (ITV)Why is he a sir?Stamer was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 2014 in recognition of his work in the legal profession, culminating in a five-year term as Director of Public Prosecutions.He first became a barrister in 1987 at the Middle Temple, later joining Doughty Street Chambers and was appointed a Queen’s Counsel in 2002, aged just 39. In 2008 he was appointed head of the Crown Prosecution Service and DPP.During his tenure he chose to prosecute three Labour MPs and a Conservative in the wake of the parliamentary expenses scandal, and was responsible for prosecuting former MP Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce for perverting the course of justice after Pryce claimed responsibility for her former husband’s speeding offence.Starmer on... the NHSThe Labour leader has said that, if elected, his government would “get the NHS working around the clock and pay staff properly to do it”.The remark followed a commitment to provide £1.1bn in funding for the health service to cut waiting lists by paying doctors and nurses to carry out additional out-of-hours care, which would be funded by axing tax breaks for wealthy “non-doms” who hoard money overseas. He added: “The Conservative Party that brought our NHS to its knees will put it in the ground. We have to get it back on its feet.”Starmer describes the NHS as “the crowdfunded solution for all of us”, reinforcing his commitment to healthcare being free at the point of use, but says reform is inevitable or the health service would “remain on life support”. He has pledged to integrate up-to-date technology into every part of the NHS including using artificial intelligence to diagnose disease earlier and more accurately.He supported the doctors strikes, telling ministers: “Don’t break junior doctors, talk to them. Get in the room [and] sort it out.”Starmer with his wife, Lady Victoria Starmer, at the Labour Party Conference in October 2023. (Alamy)Starmer on… immigrationThe government has “lost control of borders”, according to Labour. Starmer has said a Labour government would set up a new policy unit to tackle illegal migration and has suggested that a returns agreement for asylum seekers could be negotiated with the European Union to solve the small boats crisis.He described the government’s thwarted Rwanda plan, which would see illegal migrants deported to the African nation but has to be put into practice due to legal blocks, as a “gimmick” and a “farce” and has promised to reverse it.Starmer on... the cost of living crisisStarmer has sought to keep Rishi Sunak’s handling of the cost of living crisis in the minds of voters by claiming that “his fingerprints are all over their struggling household budgets”. In a letter to his shadow cabinet, leaked to The Guardian, he wrote: “Rishi Sunak is the chief architect of choices prioritising the wealthiest and of the government’s failure to get a grip of the economy and get growth going.”He has said he would prioritise tackling inflation, blaming it for putting up prices and eroding household savings, but has pledged to “take the difficult and responsible decisions” to bring it down.Starmer pictured in 2010, when he was director of public prosecution at the CPS, making a statement about MPs who face charges over their expenses claims. (Getty)Starmer on... private schoolsLabour has dropped its early promise to scrap charitable status for private schools, but has committed to levying a 20% VAT rate on school fees removing their “unfair tax break”. The money raised, he said, will be used to address the “appalling state” of the school system for all children.“It’s not an attack on private schools. It’s just saying an exemption you have had is going to go,” he warned private schools who have been critical of the plan – reminding them they are not obliged to pass that tax on to parents in the form of increased fees.Starmer on… the House of LordsWhen he was first Labour leader, Starmer proposed a “root and branch reform of the centre of government… rooting out unearned privilege and addressing unaccountable power”.But his promise to scrap the House of Lords within the first four years of a new parliament - a controversial move that caused a split among his party’s grandees, has been abandoned.Starmer still backs plans for a second chamber “electoral legitimacy”, but as his party nears government he has stepped away from the most radical form of that pledge. He is now reportedly committed to cutting the number of hereditary peers, reducing the size of the chamber and introducing a new appointments process."
Sky News,Britain's homeless question whether to vote in the general election when political promises always fall short,[],Sky News,Updated 23 June 2024 at 10:58 pm·5-min read,23,June,2024,10:58:00,5,"Trevor is too scared to sleep in a tent at night like the other rough sleepers.He sleeps on a park bench or in a doorway. It's safer.""Some people come along and set your tent on fire,"" he tells me.He says no one ever zips up their sleeping bags or tent doors in case they need to escape quickly.This shocking story of the dangers faced by being homeless on the streets of London doesn't seem to shock Trevor. It's just part of life, he says.""There's no point reporting it to the police, they won't do anything.""At 53 years old, Trevor has been homeless for the best part of a decade.In and out of temporary accommodation, night shelters and hostels. He says he's tired.But he's also fed up with what he says is a long line of broken political promises that have failed to tackle Britain's worsening housing crisis.""Every government has always said that they are going to solve this problem. But none of them have,"" he says.Trevor is right. Because the latest figures are stark and reveal a worsening situation.In the run-up to the election, all of the political parties are promising to tackle the issue.A 'source of national shame'The annual rough sleeping snapshot provides the government's estimate for how many people were rough sleeping on a given night in autumn 2023.It shows that 3,898 people were sleeping rough across England, an increase of 27% on the previous year.And the number of people sleeping rough is now 61% higher than it was 10 years ago.The Conservatives defend their record despite not having met their 2019 manifesto promise to build 300,000 new homes a year.While Labour says they want to build 1.5 million new homes in their first five years in power.But crucially, there is no target for the number of affordable or social homes Labour would build.And that is central to easing the housing crisis, according to Matt Downie, chief executive of the homeless charity Crisis.""The scale of rough sleeping is now a source of national shame. It is a sign of extreme inequality and must prompt a rethink at the highest levels of government,"" he says.""It cannot be overstated how dehumanising sleeping on the streets is. Through our frontline services we hear directly from people who have been spat at, urinated on or attacked simply because they do not have the security of a safe home. Things have got to change.""To bring these numbers down, we urgently need Westminster to put long-term funding into the proven solutions. We need to see a commitment to build the levels of social housing we need every year.""For Trevor, who is desperate to find a place to call home, the sums do not add up.In his area of Brent, northwest London, rooms rent for upwards of £1,000 a month. He has come to a Crisis drop-in centre to get help.But they are busier than ever, explains operations manager Nick Bradshaw.""Over the last six months, we've seen a 40 to 50% increase in some of the people approaching us for support. Which is huge,"" Mr Bradshaw says.""We're seeing a lot more older adults in their 60s, 70s and 80s who have been in insecure accommodation, who are not able to stay there any more or have been sofa surfing.""A rise in older homeless peopleThis rise in older people needing help is worrying charities like Crisis.Older people can be more vulnerable, struggle with their health and can be harder to house because they might have less financial stability.Homelessness among those aged 65 onwards has jumped by 13% in the last year. Now almost 14,000 people are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless, according to the charity Independent Age.At the drop in centre, I meet 67-year-old Cleon Riley, who has lived in this area all his life.He tells me his partner died last month and the landlord wanted him out of the flat they shared.""The landlord changed the locks and I was out on the street,"" he says.He tells me that one landlord wanted £1,000 for a room. He cannot afford that. So he has been sleeping in a night shelter and wandering the streets during the day.This centre is full of people who have been let down by the housing system. Most here tell me they feel forgotten about.But there is one thing they can do to make their voices heard.'I don't have faith in politics'In the kitchen area, the homeless men are being urged to sign up to vote in this election.Trevor is looking over the forms he needs to fill out in order to vote on 4 July.He says he has always tried to vote. Brexit was the last time he went to a polling station.""I don't have much faith in politics or the government. I don't think they've given me much inspiration recently,"" he says.And it is perhaps understandable that Trevor feels this way.Read more:Plans to 'criminalise' homelessness scrappedFamilies homeless despite empty housesAlmost one million renters given no-fault evictionsThe COVID pandemic and subsequent cost of living crisis has not just hit the homeless hard.

South Wales Argus,Election candidates clash over plan for VAT on private school fees,[],Twm Owen,24 June 2024 at 0:00 am·3-min read,24,June,2024,00:00:00,3,"LABOUR’S plan to charge VAT on private school fees shouldn’t automatically lead to higher costs for parents, a Gwent candidate has said.Catherine Fookes, who is standing for the party in Monmouthshire which is home to one of Wales’ best known independent schools, said the impact of raising VAT on fees charged to parents will be a matter for those schools.She was speaking after the Liberal Democrat candidate for Monmouthshire said he wanted to clarify the party is opposed to “taxing education”.William Powell, a qualified languages teacher who has taught in both the state and independent sector, said: “I oppose any attempt to undermine parental choice – especially when it could impact further on class sizes in state schools.”Mr Powell said he attended his local state school, near Brecon in Powys, as did his own children but said he also feared raising VAT on fees would mean private schools would do less in their local communities.He said he’d been asked to clarify his party’s stance after attending hustings and a recording of BBC Radio 4’s Any Questions political discussion show in Newport.He said: “As we already see in Monmouthshire, independent schools often give back to our local community in accordance with their charitable status.“Liberal Democrats want to see this sort of best practice become the norm across the sector, with sharing sports facilities, theatre spaces or specialist teachers; mentoring schemes for teachers and pupils; higher education support;  debating clubs as well as bursaries and scholarships.“Under Labour’s proposed regressive policy, all this great partnership work would inevitably be the first thing that private schools cut back on – and everyone would therefore be the loser.”Labour’s candidate, who is also a county councillor representing Monmouth, said she has already met with the headteacher of the town’s Haberdashers independent school, and defended Labour’s policy.Ms Fookes, who has also been a governor at Monmouth Comprehensive, said she recognised the independent schools in Monmouth as “part of our community” and added they “contribute to our local economy and are used by many families.”READ MORE: Questions wanted for Abergavenny general election hustingsShe said: “A UK Labour government will levy VAT on private schools, end their business rate exemptions and spend that money improving standards and opportunities for the over 93 per cent of children attending state schools.“I have already met with the headteacher of the Haberdashers school as I know that if I am elected, I would need to represent all the residents in the community, no matter where they go to school. No additional costs are required to be passed on to families by independent schools. That will be a decision for them to make.”Labour has said additional funds from VAT on fees would support the recruitment of 6,500 new teachers in England, and new teachers in Wales though leader Kier Starmer acknowledged, when he visited Abergavenny, it would be a matter for the Welsh Government how it spends additional funding.Ms Fookes said she wants Labour to “drive high standards in all our state schools” and said: “Our Welsh Labour Government has been doing this with one hand tied behind its back.”Mr Powell said the Liberal Democrats want a “fairer funding formula for Wales” which he claimed would deliver more money than Labour’s planned VAT rise. He also said the current VAT exemption applies to all education provided by “an eligible body” including universities, music lessons and tutoring sessions.Figures from member association the Independent Schools Council show there are 7,304 pupils attending 19 independent schools in Wales in 2024, which is the lowest number of any part of the UK other than the north east of England.Full list of candidates standing in the Monmouthshire constituency:Ian Chandler, Green PartyDavid TC Davies, Welsh ConservativeJune Davies, True & Fair PartyCatherine Fookes, Welsh LabourOwen Lewis, IndependentEmma Meredith, Heritage PartyWilliam Powell, Welsh Liberal DemocratsMax Windsor-Peplow, Reform UK"

These are their stories.***ZoyaAge: 28 Location: Birmingham Job: Telecoms manager Previous vote: Labour Probable vote: Green Favourite news source: TikTok/InstagramZoya had never heard of the Israel-Palestine dispute before the 7 October attack by Hamas and Israel’s subsequent aerial bombardment and ground invasion. Since then her social media feeds have been swamped with Gaza-related content and it has become one of her top political issues. This has undermined her trust in the BBC and Sky News, which she feels are pro-Israel. She prefers Instagram, TikTok and clips from Al Jazeera as they provide her with pro-Palestine content, some of which is AI-generated.Her phone usage stats show she consumes very little mainstream media. She doesn’t watch much TV and spends most of her evening scrolling on her phone. Zoya doesn’t visit news websites because she thinks their stories are too long and full of jargon. Instead, occasional bits of news filter through on her social media feeds among food and lifestyle material, often made by British-Pakistani content creators.Her screen recording shows she encounters very little election-related content. She spends a lot of time looking at videos of life in Dubai and she is intrigued by a TikTok video posted by an influencer claiming that Rishi Sunak is offering people £75,000 to emigrate from the UK. (The claim is fake.)When she does want political information, she searches TikTok for summaries of party policies. She is mainly concerned about health and crime, but is opposed to proposals to send more money to Ukraine and wants it spent in the UK instead. She said she liked Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader, because he was a “good guy” who understood her community, unlike Keir Starmer, and would probably vote Green due to the party’s policy on Gaza.***StaceyAge: 36 Location: Clacton Job: Full-time mother of five Previous vote: N/A Probable vote: Labour Favourite news source: FacebookStacey is the sort of voter Nigel Farage needs to win if he is to be elected in Clacton. But her respect for the Reform leader went down after seeing claims online suggesting the Reform party leader staged being attacked by a milkshake. (These claims are false.)She spends six hours a day on Facebook, TikTok and Instagram. She sees close to nothing about national news, but will sometimes click on a Sun or MailOnline celebrity story if it is recommended by Facebook.Her news content mainly consists of updates posted on local Facebook groups by members of the public, but she also checks the Facebook page of her local Clacton and Frinton Gazette. If she wants to research something, she will Google it.She lives with five children, some who have disabilities, in a two-bed house with mould. Her biggest concern is the lack of social housing in Clacton, and she is upset that when a local council development was built, homes were given to people “from out of the area”.Her main exposure to election-related media on her phone was a paid-for Facebook advert by the local Labour party candidate. She stumbled across his video in her feed by chance, but spent several minutes watching it and reading the comments. She concluded that she might vote for him as he understood local issues and was promising more housing.***SimonAge: 45 Location: Dundee Job: Technician Previous vote: SNP Probable vote: SNP Favourite news source: FacebookSimon’s phone recording showed him spending an average of five hours a day on Facebook, mainly scrolling his news feed without engaging deeply with any content.A strong supporter of Scottish independence, he lost faith in the BBC over its perceived pro-union bias during the 2014 referendum. Despite this, he still “reluctantly” visits their news website regularly for overviews of what is going on in the world and sometimes watches BBC TV news and listens to Radio 2.He used to be a “fervent” online poster, but no longer publicly shares much content. Instead, like other people in this study, he shares material privately in WhatsApp groups. The arrival of Euro 2024 has also seen politics content overwhelmed by Tartan army memes.Politics content on his feed was often in the form of memes – such as a Simpsons joke mocking Starmer for repeatedly mentioning that his father was a toolmaker. Simon paused scrolling for long enough to comment: “He’s the tool.” He also hovered over a meme of Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross being kicked by a man in a kilt and one of Farage turning into Hitler.Simon has heard Conservative minister Grant Shapps’ warning of a Labour supermajority – which strengthened his desire to vote for the Scottish National party.***AvaAge: 67 Location: Lowestoft Job: Technician Previous vote: Conservative Probable vote: Undecided Favourite news source: BBCAva’s phone activity shows she has retreated from political news on social media. On Facebook, she has unfriended many “acquaintances” due to unpleasant political discussions during past elections. Instead, she has turned back to BBC TV news and the World Service.She avoids engaging in political debates online so as not to offend others with her opinions or risk receiving offensive comments. She has growing disdain for online political content, saying: “If anybody were to admit to me that they made their minds up on who to vote on some Instagram posts, I’d be less than impressed.”She is a lifelong Conservative voter but did not mind Labour until “Mr Corbyn came in”. His policies – such as support for nuclear disarmament – left her feeling “afraid”. She much prefers Starmer, but dislikes the Labour leader’s deputy, Angela Rayner.***FinleyAge: 19 Location: Buckinghamshire Job: Student Previous vote: N/A Probable vote: Liberal Democrat Favourite news source: X/YouTubeFinley is an avid gamer and first-time voter who has never had any relationship with mainstream news outlets. Instead, he relies on TikTok, X and Instagram – but he will turn to YouTube for lengthy explainers on complicated topics.Many of his opinions are formed by watching reaction videos. He won’t read traditional news stories, but will seek out extreme viewpoints in order to comprehend political arguments, saying: “I suppose I’d be more interested in people’s reactions than, you know, the thing itself.”His Instagram feed is full of Gaza content, but his main concern in this election is transgender rights. He was prompted to research party manifestos after stumbling across a decade-old video on TikTok explaining elections by the comedian Jay Foreman. Finley was deeply concerned about the government’s temporary ban on puberty blockers, although he did not know which party introduced it.He has never watched linear TV and does not passively consume broadcast news. Instead, he relaxes by flicking through TikTok videos at speed, usually giving them a fraction of a second of his attention. A few of Labour’s in-house TikTok posts made their way into his feed, but he thought many of them were “a bit annoying” and trying too hard.He knew Farage, but only as a meme, rather than a politician, largely because gamers used the Cameo app to pay the Reform leader to say silly things. He also learned about Sunak leaving the D-day commemorations early only after seeing a reaction video by the YouTuber Niko Omilana.He trusts the BBC News brand, but never actively consumes any of its content. He also could not understand why older people posted political content under their own names on social media.***MatthewAge: 60 Location: Wigan Job: Retired Previous vote: Conservative Probable vote: Labour Favourite news source: BBC NewsA self-described creature of habit, Matthew makes a point of sitting down in front of the TV for the evening news at 10pm. He also regularly checks the BBC News app during the day, although he rarely reads beyond the headlines and the first few paragraphs of any story. If there’s something he’s really interested in, then he’ll share a link in a WhatsApp group for friends or ex-colleagues – and he laughed at memes of Sunak portrayed as a Dickensian child asking for “more Sky TV”.He reads a lot of business news from mainstream news outlets through the Stocks app on his iPhone, even though he’s not entirely sure why he sees it. “If it’s ended up in the Apple app, you broadly think it’s probably going to be correct … If it’s on there, I think it’s trustworthy,” he said.He liked Tony Blair, voted Remain, but strongly disliked Corbyn. He is now considering voting Labour, in part because the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, worked at the Bank of England and he feels the country is ready for change. He does not seem engaged by culture war topics: “I mean, I hear this word ‘woke’, which, I mean, I don’t even understand it, I don’t even know what it actually means.”"

The term is also sometimes used to refer to the election itself, as in ‘they could not win at the ballot box’.CampaignThe time before an election in which politicians persuade people to vote for them. In the case of the 2024 election in the UK, parliament was dissolved on the 30 May and the election will take place on 4 July.CanvassingGoing round a particular area trying to persuade people to vote for one party or the other.In UK elections, this is often done by volunteers knocking on people’s doors.Capital gains taxCapital gains tax is a tax on profit when people sell assets that have increased in value.In the 2024 election, the Conservatives have promised that landlords who sell to sitting tenants will be spared capital gains tax on the proceeds, while Labour has left the door open to raising capital gains.Child benefitChild benefit is a benefit paid to parents with children under 16 (or under 20 in approved education or training).The Conservatives have promised to increase the threshold at which high earners start to lose the benefit from £60,000 to £120,000.Sir Keir Starmer, like the Conservatives, has pledged not to raise VAT. (Photo by Stefan Rousseau/PA Images via Getty Images)CoalitionA coalition government is a government formed jointly by more than one political party (for example, by the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives in 2010).ConstituencyThe geographical area that is represented by each MP in the House of Commons.ECHRThe European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is an international convention which protects human rights in Europe.The Conservative manifesto stopped short of promising to withdraw from the ECHR, which would have made plans such as the plan to deport migrants to Rwanda easier.Exit pollA poll conducted outside polling stations just after people have voted on election day.On election day, the results of Britain’s exit poll are published just after polls close at 10pm and tend to give a more accurate prediction of the result than previous polls produced throughout the campaign.First past the postThe first past the post system is used to elect MPs to the House of Commons.The candidate with the most votes in each constituency becomes MP, and the party with the most MPs becomes the government.This can mean that the winning party actually has a minority of votes cast: in 2019, the Conservatives had 43.6% of the vote.Hung parliamentA hung parliament is where no party has enough seats to form an overall majority. For example, both the 2010 election and 2017 elections resulted in hung parliament.In 2010, the Conservatives formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, while in 2017, the Conservatives formed a minority government with a 'confidence and supply' agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).Income tax thresholdThe thresholds between the tax-free allowance, basic rate tax and higher rates of tax.Both parties have said they will continue the freeze on income tax thresholds brought in under the Conservatives, which means people pay more tax as more and more people are pushed into higher tax brackets if wages rise.MajorityA party with a majority – more than half of the seats in the House of Commons – has won the election.The number of votes by which an individual MP wins a constituency is also referred to as their majority.ManifestoPolitical parties publish manifestos before a general election, with a set of policies that the party stands for and aims to implement if elected.Manifesto pledges are not legally binding.Marginal seatA seat in which the incumbent MP won by a small majority, meaning a swing is more likely than in a so-called ‘safe seat’ where the MP had a large majority.Net zeroThe UK Government has set a goal for Britain’s emissions to reach net zero – where emission and removal of greenhouse gases reaches equilibrium – by 2050.All major parties are expected to stick to this goal, barring Reform UK.Opinion pollAn opinion poll is a research survey (usually carried out on a representative sample of the electorate) to gauge likely results in an election.Poll‘The polls’ refers to the places where people vote in an election: exit polls and opinion polls refer to two kinds of survey used to predict election results.Postal voteAn absentee vote where the vote is sent in by post.At the 2019 general election, 17.2% of voters across the UK used a postal ballot.Proxy voteA vote where a person who can’t make it to the booth appoints someone to vote for them.In the 2019 election, 0.6% of voters appointed a proxy.PsephologyPsephology is the scientific study of elections and voting and is used to predict and analyse election results.Polling dayThe day when the country places their vote: in the UK 2024 election, this is July 4.PurdahBefore British elections, the country enters purdah, officially known as the ‘pre-election period of sensitivity’.Purdah means that politicians (both local and national) and other people such as civil servants face restrictions on what they can do and announce.Ministers who remain in office can’t announce new funding, or new policies, or anything which might sway voters or make the government more popular.The idea is that public money cannot be spent on the election.Spoiled ballotA ballot paper which has been marked wrongly (for instance with a vote for more than one candidate) will not be counted.Sometimes people spoil ballots deliberately as a protest vote to show dissatisfactionSwing‘Swing’ is the change in voter support for a political party between one election and the next.It is used to analyse the performance of parties in different areas.Tax burdenThe tax burden refers to the total amount of taxes paid by a group (in this case the UK as a whole) as a proportion of total income.The tax burden is currently at its highest in 70 years according to the OECD.The Equality ActThe 2010 Equality Act protects people against discrimination in Britain.The Conservatives want to ‘tweak’ the Act so that sex-based protections only apply on the basis of someone’s biological sex.Triple lockThe triple lock is a guarantee introduced to the state pension in 2010 so it would not lose value in real terms.The guarantee means that the state pension will rise by the highest out of average earnings, inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) or 2.5%.Triple lock plusThe ‘triple lock plus’ is a Conservative policy, which would see the tax-free pension allowance rise every year in line with the triple lock of average wages, inflation, or 2.5% – whichever is highest, to prevent pensioners being pulled into paying income tax.TurnoutTurnout refers to the percentage of people eligible to vote who turn out to vote on election day.In the 2019 election, for example, 67.3% of those eligible turned out to vote.VATValue added tax is added to goods and services sold by VAT-registered companies, and is the third-largest source of government income after income tax and national insurance.Both Labour and the Conservatives have pledged not to raise VAT.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

The polls have consistently painted a very bleak picture for the prime minister, with Labour holding on to a double-digit poll lead over his Conservatives.Recent by-election results suggest that Labour is likely to win a landslide victory – but there’s still time for the PM to turn it around.Here’s everything you need to know about Sunak and what’s he’s saying about the biggest issues in British politics right now.Early lifeSunak was born in Southampton in 1980, the eldest of three children. His Indian parents both arrived from East Africa in the 1960s. A football-mad boy whose childhood idol was Matt Le Tissier, Sunak was described by the family’s neighbours as a child with “lovely manners”.In his youngest years, the PM attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. According to a recent biography, fellow pupil Ollie Case said: “He was someone that was talked about. The teachers would say: ‘He’s going to be prime minister'.""But, growing up in the 1980s and 90s, he also remembers experiencing racism. “My mother was obsessed with us not having accents,” Sunak has said.Rishi Sunak was football-mad as a boy growing up in Southampton. (ITV)Sunak's familySunak is married to Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian entrepreneur and multi-billionaire. The pair first met in 2004 at Stanford University, his future wife apparently attracted to his “honesty and integrity”.Five years later they married in a two-day Indian wedding held in Bangalore. The couple have two daughters, Krishna and Anoushka, who will turn 13 and 11 this year, both of whom are largely kept out of the public eye.Sunak attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. (Rishi Sunak, Instagram)His parentsYashvir Sunak, Rishi’s father, was born in Kenya. He arrived in the UK to study medicine and then stayed, becoming an NHS GP. His mother, Usha, was born in Tanzania and is a pharmacist.The couple met in Britain and settled in Southampton in the 1970s. Usha is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.His educationAs a teenager Sunak studied at Winchester College where he was, he says, a self-confessed “geek”. According to a recent biography, the “naughtiest” thing the prime minister did during his school days “was to smuggle a hand-held television into the school so that he did not miss any key games of Euro 96”.The childhood home of Rishi Sunak in Southampton. (Getty Images, photo taken in 2022)Perhaps unsurprisingly for someone with such an unblemished record, he went on to become the school’s head boy. Sunak worked while studying, delivering medicines for his mother’s pharmacy and as a waiter at a local Indian restaurant.After school, Sunk read philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, graduating in 2001 with a first class degree. While still at university he held an internship at the Conservative Party campaign headquarters and joined the party, but went on studying before entering politics.He earned his MBA from Stanford in 2006 as a Fulbright Scholar, meaning he was selected among the most promising candidates from the UK.How much is he worth?As prime minister, Rishi Sunak earns £80,807 on top of a salary of £84,144 for being an MP. But his current income from Westminster pales in comparison to his family’s vast wealth through marriage.The Sunday Times valued the couple’s joint fortune at £730m. Murty's father is the co-founder of Infosys, an Indian tech conglomerate, in which she holds shares estimated at around £430m. Her family is also involved in a £900m business arrangement with Amazon in India, and she is a shareholder of multiple other companies.Rishi Sunak's mother is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.Before entering politics Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and a series of hedge funds. He is also known to have invested in blind trusts, in which investments are made without holders knowing where the funds are located. These arrangements reportedly hold Sunak’s own multi-million-pound fortune.His religionSunak is not only the first prime minister of colour and of Indian heritage but he is also the first practising Hindu to hold the biggest job in UK politics.He has spoken of his pride in his Hindu faith, saying, “that’s how I was raised, and that’s how I am”. He said: “Having faith gives you resilience, gives you strength that is important and it provides an outlook on life which I find particularly valuable.”Sunak on... the NHSThe prime minister’s biggest challenge in office has been the crisis in the NHS - and to many people in the sector his government has been found wanting. “We have not made enough progress,” Sunak said when asked about his commitment to cut NHS waiting lists during an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV. Asked if that meant he had failed, the prime minister replied: “Yes, we have.""Sunak expects to see waiting lists start to reduce this spring, and blames the delays on “industrial action”, as disputes with junior doctors and consultants over pay and conditions continue. Yet Sunak himself has been blamed for holding up a deal that would prevent more walkouts.Sunak, his wife Akshata and daughters Anoushka and Krishna (second left) at Santa Monica Pier, California, on their summer holiday in 2023. (AP)Sunak on… immigrationAccording to the prime minister, illegal migration threatens to “overwhelm” Europe. In June 2023 he claimed his plan to “stop the boats” and tackle illegal immigration was working, but by August 2023 he had changed his mind: “It’s not an easy problem to fix,” he told broadcasters. “I never said we would be able to solve it overnight.”He has staked much of his reputation on the government's Rwanda Bill - his plan to deport asylum seekers to the east African country that finally became law last month, after months of legal and procedural challenges. It has paved the way for deportation flights to get off the ground within weeks.He described his policy, which he says will act as a deterrent to people traffickers, as being “the will of the people” – yet polling suggests low support for such a punitive approach.The policy, coupled with Conservative talk of limits on legal migration, shows that the government is committed to taking a hard line on the issue, despite the risk of alienating more moderate voters.The Rwanda policy is not universally popular. (YouGov)Sunak on... the cost of living crisisThe prime minister has told hard-pressed working families that they will feel some relief from the cost of living crisis as inflation continues to drop following its highs of October 2022. He described the government’s tax cuts as “meaningful” and has welcomed the dip in mortgage rates at the turn of the year.Sunak says falling inflation will have the biggest impact on family budgets “and will start to ease some of those pressures” and that he was right to focus on that figure. However, the global drop in energy prices is probably the biggest factor in easing the hit on wallets - something that the prime minister has no control over.However, the fall in inflation to 2.3% on 22 May this year – the lowest it has been in nearly three years – was likely one of the key factors in persuading Sunak to call a snap election many weeks earlier than experts had predicted.Can we expect more handouts or tax breaks to help balance family budgets? Not according to Sunak, who has warned voters that it’s time to “move on” from government support.Sunak on... pensionsThe triple-lock pensions policy is a tricky one for Sunak – especially since Labour has committed to retaining the policy. Any change to a policy that has become a hallmark of recent Conservative governments would not go down well with the 12 million pensioners it would likely impact – many of whom are lifelong Tory voters.Last November, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said pensions should start being pegged to an average of inflation and wage growth, which would help reduce state spending over time.Sunak’s response to that was ambiguous to say the least: “We are the government that has … delivered the triple lock and it is why, right now, pensions are, depending on how you look at it, £800 or £900 bigger than they otherwise would have been.” He is yet to confirm whether it will appear in the manifesto."
The Telegraph,Rishi Sunak has just 10 days to neutralise the Reform threat,[],Telegraph View,23 June 2024 at 10:00 pm·2-min read,23,June,2024,10:00:00,2,"We are entering the last full week of campaigning for a general election that many have written off as a foregone conclusion. Certainly the chances of a Conservative victory are remote, as conceded by a number of senior ministers anxious to limit the damage to their own party.But while the polls are unremittingly bleak, they still show a large number of undecideds as well as Tories deserting their natural home who might yet be persuaded back.Many say they intend to vote for Reform UK, which in some polls is running neck and neck with the Conservatives. Their two votes combined would be enough to run Labour close in the election yet Sir Keir Starmer seems to be on course for the biggest parliamentary majority in post-war history.If Rishi Sunak’s intention in calling a snap election was to catch Reform off guard and squeeze its vote then it has backfired. The pollster Peter Kellner believes there are three million Conservatives who are moving over to Reform and need to be won back by July 4. There are around 130 seats which polling projections say Labour will win where the combined Tory-Reform vote would be sufficient to keep them in Conservative hands.Even holding on to half of these constituencies would be the difference between a virtual wipeout for the Tories and a respectable result providing a platform on which to provide strong opposition and build for the future.Nigel Farage’s comments about Nato’s role in Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine may persuade many Tories thinking of voting Reform to stay loyal. So, too, might the prospect of Labour winning an unprecedented majority because of the split on the Right. Mr Sunak has 10 days to convince them and save his party."
Yahoo News UK,"Three important UK election issues, explainedRishi Sunak said his leadership is needed in 'uncertain' times. Keir Starmer said the country needs to be 'rebuilt'. So what issues do voters care about most?","['The economy', 'Health', 'Immigration and asylum']",James Cheng-Morris,Updated 28 May 2024 at 11:11 am·5-min read,28,May,2024,11:11:00,5,"After months of speculation, Rishi Sunak confirmed the general election will be held on 4 July.The prime minister said Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer could not be trusted to lead the country through “uncertain” times. He made the economy and combating global security the key elements of his pitch to the nation as he announced the election date.In response, Starmer told voters: “Together we can stop the chaos, we can turn the page, we can start to rebuild Britain.”But amid this “uncertainty” and need to “rebuild”, what do the voters consider the key issues?This chart, produced using YouGov polling over the course of this parliament, offers an insight in the issues voters care most about and how that has ebbed and flowed over time.Compared to when Boris Johnson's Tories won the December 2019 poll, the economy, immigration, defence and tax have grown in importance in the eyes of the electorate. This has come amid the cost of living crisis; small boats crossing the English Channel; the onset of the Ukraine war and wider global instability; and the highest tax burden in 70 years.Housing has also become a bigger concern, with the Renters Reform Bill - in which the government pledged to scrap no-fault evictions - having been paused after Sunak called the election.Meanwhile, the last general election was fought - and won by the Tories - on a single issue: Brexit. Yet the chart shows a clear downturn in its relevance among voters, particularly after a trade deal was agreed with the EU in December 2020.This next chart, meanwhile, highlights what voters have considered the top issues over the past year. By a wide margin, the top three are the economy, health and immigration and asylum.Here, Yahoo News UK breaks down what is behind these issues and how they have ebbed and flowed in importance among voters since the last election in 2019.The economyThe unprecedented lockdown called by Boris Johnson in March 2020 meant the public’s attention shifted to the economy, as demonstrated by the huge spike in the chart above. The then-chancellor Rishi Sunak was forced to implement a £70bn furlough scheme, lasting 18 months, to protect people’s jobs.There was a second almighty economic shock - and rise in public concern - in February 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This caused a further spike in an already turbulent wholesale energy market, driving up costs for suppliers and ultimately customers.Average energy bills eventually reached £2,500 a year (and would have exceeded £4,000 had the government not intervened). This was double the £1,278 consumers were paying before the war and by the time this election takes place, people will still be paying much more than this: £1,568.Energy prices were also a key driver in inflation reaching 11.1% - a 41-year high - by October 2022, though it has since fallen to 2.3%, which is near the Bank of England’s 2.0% target.The third economic shock of this parliament - and most damaging for the Tories - was in October 2022 when Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng's disastrous “mini budget”, containing £45bn of unfunded tax cuts, prompted an economic crisis. It led to soaring interest rates, and to this day homeowners who are remortgaging are facing significantly higher bills.HealthHealth, like the economy, is another issue which clearly correlated with the beginning of the pandemic. The above chart shows an enormous spike in public concern when COVID cases started to multiply in March 2020, ultimately leading to the nationwide lockdown as the NHS faced collapse.Cases fell that summer, but spikes in the chart can be seen once infections rose again and fresh nationwide lockdowns were imposed in October 2020 and January 2021. By March 2022, likely as concerns over the Omicron variant faded, there was much less concern about health.In January last year, there was a brief spike as the NHS in England experienced the biggest industrial action in its history, with tens of thousands of nurses and ambulance staff walking out simultaneously.As for the state of play going into the election, NHS waiting lists remain higher than they were when Sunak vowed to cut them last year. According to the latest figures, an estimated 7.54 million treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of March, relating to 6.29 million patients.Immigration and asylumSince the last election, the immigration and asylum narrative has largely revolved around one issue: small boats crossing the English Channel.The numbers have risen in most of the intervening years: there were 1,843 crossings in 2019, 8,466 in 2020, 28,526 in 2021, 45,774 in 2022 and 29,437 last year. This year, the number has already passed the 10,000 mark.The regular sharp spikes in the above chart demonstrate how frequently crossings have been in the news, including some occasions when hundreds of migrants have made the dangerous journey in a single day.But it also reflects how the government has made this part of its own agenda. It was Boris Johnson’s government which first announced plans to deport migrants to Rwanda in April 2022. That policy was picked up by Rishi Sunak when he became prime minister in October that year, with Sunak since repeating his pledge to “stop the boats”.But after calling the election, Sunak admitted this week that flights would not take off before the country goes to the polls.Read moreFive important laws that could be dropped due to Sunak's snap election (Yahoo News UK)OPINION - Rishi Sunak has been in last-ditch campaign mode for so long — a General Election is logical (Evening Standard)Door open for Boris Johnson to campaign for Tories, Rishi Sunak signals (PA Media)"
Yahoo News UK,"3 electoral maps that show how disastrous the election could be for the ToriesWith new modelling predicting a Labour victory even bigger than Tony Blair's 1997 landslide, the outlook for Rishi Sunak is not looking good.",['Which Tory ministers are at risk of losing their seats?'],James Cheng-Morris and  James Hockaday,Updated 5 June 2024 at 8:34 am·4-min read,5,June,2024,08:34:00,4,"The outlook was already looking bleak for the Conservative Party when Rishi Sunak called the general election following months of dismal approval ratings that showed little sign of improving.At a campaign event last week, Sunak said he didn't think defeat to Labour was a ""foregone conclusion"", suggesting his main election rival Sir Keir Starmer was taking the British electorate ""for granted"".However, a general election projection released on Monday will have added to the Tories' woes – predicting the biggest win for Labour in the party's history, surpassing even that of Tony Blair's 1997 landslide.The analysis, carried out by YouGov for Sky News, used a relatively new polling technique called Multi-level Regression and Post-stratification (MRP), which is regarded to have had a good track record and can provide detailed predictions at a constituency level basis. The scale of Sunak's problems is demonstrated by the interactive maps below, showing just how much ground the Tories are expected to lose compared to their 2019 victory.Click on the arrows in the top left to switch between the two maps. Check your own constituency to see if it is projected to change handsThe first map above shows the seats won in the 2019 general election, when Boris Johnson led the party to a stunning majority.The wall of Tory blue on the map, compared to the spots of Labour red, is a demonstration of just how far Labour, then led by Jeremy Corbyn, had fallen in public standing. The result was Labour's worst electoral performance since 1935.If you toggle to the second map, the projection by YouGov (which was based on polling carried out between 24 May - 1 June) suggests that Starmer's party is on track to win 422 seats, with the Tories down to just 140.Such a result would be the Conservative Party's worst performance at a general election since 1906. If YouGov's predictions are accurate, Labour winning a 194-seat majority would be the highest number since Conservative Stanley Baldwin won a majority of 208 in 1924.The model suggests the Conservatives could be set for near wipeout across many areas of the country, including London, the North East, the North West, and Wales.It also projects that the Scottish National Party would lose more than half their seats, with Labour returning as the largest party north of the border, and the Liberal Democrats reclaiming its place as the third party of British politics – winning 48 seats.The new figures, released yesterday, came as Reform UK co-founder Nigel Farage announced that he would be returning as the populist party's leader and would stand for election in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. Even before Farage's latest bid, pollsters told Yahoo News that Reform UK could pose a serious threat to the Tories by splitting the vote and potentially handing even more seats to Labour.The YouGov projection follows a similar poll by modelling site Electoral Calculus, which came out on 31 May. The polling also compares the 2019 result with Electoral Calculus' projection.It predicts that Labour is on course to win an even bigger majority of 319 seats - with Starmer's party picking up 485 MPs and the Tories way behind with 66. The modelling shows the Lib Dems getting very close to the Conservative Party, with 59 seats.While Electoral Calculus' polling, based on opinion polls from 8 May to 20 May, returns a different set of projections to YouGov's, both clearly indicate the scale of the problem facing Sunak.The Electoral Calculus model has predicted Sir Keir Starmer's Labour will win a massive majority.

The Guardian,‘There’s a lot less sharing’: how news consumption has changed since last UK election,[],Jim Waterson Political media editor,24 June 2024 at 0:00 am·4-min read,24,June,2024,00:00:00,4,"Is this the first post-mainstream-media election? The Guardian asked six volunteers to record their phone screens for three days – and the results provide a glimpse of what news, if any, the British public is consuming as they go to the polls.Zoya, 28, a British-Pakistani woman in Birmingham, used to be a loyal Labour voter who knew nothing about Palestine. After watching TikTok videos and AI-generated Instagram posts, she is now a Green supporter who feels Gaza is her top issue.Stacey, 36, who lives in the Clacton constituency where Nigel Farage is standing for election, rarely engages with mainstream news outlets, but may vote Labour for the first time after the party paid to push adverts into her Facebook feed.Finley, 19, a student in Buckinghamshire, has almost zero connection with mainstream news and forms his political opinions by reading the angry comments left below Instagram videos.Working with the research agency Revealing Reality, the Guardian was allowed to monitor the phone activity of these and three other volunteers and interviewed them about their media consumption.Although the sample is just a snapshot, several trends were clear: voters are seeing less political content on their social media feeds, traditional news outlets are less prominent in their lives, and influencers have an ever greater role in shaping political opinions.Most notably, compared with elections that took place in the 2010s, people are less willing to share their political views on social media. Conversations about politics are instead taking place in private chat groups on Snapchat, Instagram and WhatsApp.Damon De Ionno, of Revealing Reality, who ran the research programme, said this reflected rapid changes in online behaviour since the last general election. “Social media went through a period where it was fun to put stuff out there and it was a lighthearted playground. People are now just much more wary about putting views out there, or stories about themselves.”There is a generational divide. Older voters are still seeking out mainstream broadcasters such as the BBC and ITV and viewing it as a civic duty to be aware of the broad national news agenda.From the research group, Peter, 60, in Wigan, has stuck to his habit of watching a news bulletin every evening. Ava, 67, in Lowestoft, chose to block Facebook friends who posted about politics in the wake of the 2019 election.Peter, 45, an SNP supporter in Dundee, spends five hours a day scrolling through Facebook and views the BBC with suspicion, but still relies on the broadcaster for an overview of what is going on while picking up headlines from Radio 2.The younger participants tended to have some trust in the BBC, but they didn’t feel the same deep connection to it – and didn’t feel the need to be across the broader Westminster-centric news agenda. Instead, they cared deeply about certain key issues that they deemed directly relevant to their lives, such as the war in Gaza, gender issues and housing.As a result, the sources they relied on tended to be influencers or friends rather than mainstream news outlets. Finley, a first-time voter, knew little about Keir Starmer, but said his friendship group was talking about how the Labour leader “went back on a policy about giving trans people better rights”.Watching the phone activity of the younger participants revealed how they often encounter news stories through other people’s reaction posts – such as learning about Rishi Sunak’s D-day absence by reverse-engineering memes and jokes that float across their social media feeds. They may see election-related videos on TikTok, but when interviewed later they would barely remember viewing them.Maeve Garner, one of the researchers, said political content on social media feeds had changed a lot since the 2019 election. “Back then it was still mainstream news sources or headlines being shared. Now you see memes and videos. Memes mean there’s less conversation and debate compared to a news headline.”While there has been an enormous amount of media attention on whether the Sun will endorse a particular candidate in the election, none of the participants read a print newspaper. They relied on news aggregation services such as Apple News or Google’s Discover, which gave them a variety of headlines from a number of mainstream news websites. They were rarely aware of which particular outlet they were reading, although many turned to the BBC News website for a brief overview of what was going on.De Ionno said this could reflect the nature of the contest between Sunak and Starmer. “The personalties are very weak on both sides. It doesn’t have that human story. Boris [Johnson] was worth talking about; same with [Jeremy] Corbyn. People are is quite disengaged from the national picture.”He said a general shift in online media was under way, including in politics. “More content is being produced by influencers and people who want to be influencers. Social media has become less social – there’s a lot less sharing and nearly all the content is professionally produced.”"
Yahoo News UK,"Will Nigel Farage's Reform UK 'beat' the Tories in the election?With some polling figures putting the Tories and Reform UK nearly neck and neck, could Farage's party really end up with nearly as many MPs as Sunak's?","['What do the latest polls say?', 'Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?', 'Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?', 'What is proportional representation?']",James Cheng-Morris and  Ellen Manning,Updated 14 June 2024 at 6:33 am·7-min read,14,June,2024,06:33:00,7,"Leading pollster John Curtice has poured cold water on suggestions that Reform UK is now beating the Conservative Party in the general election polls.As representatives from seven parties took prepared to take part in a TV debate on Thursday, a YouGov survey for The Times newspaper said Reform’s support had increased by two points to 19%, putting them ahead of the Tories for the first time.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage took the the opportunity to hail the poll results in the debate, declaring: “We are now the opposition to Labour.”But Curtice urged caution, insisting that single polls should not be relied on. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""This is one poll - we’ve actually, I think, had four other polls published in the last 24 hours - none of which have had Reform ahead, not even all of which have had Reform gaining ground, but quite a couple of them certainly suggesting it’s also got very close.""He said it may not be the case that Reform are ahead - and could be on average four or five points behind. But he said: ""This is still bad news for the Conservatives. The only way Rishi Sunak can hope to get even to base camp in narrowing the lead that Labour have started off with this campaign was to squeeze the Reform vote.""He added: ""Rather than making progress, things are actually going backwards, not least of course because of Nigel Farage’s decision to fight this campaign.""With many speculating that Reform UK with Farage at the helm could ""beat"" the Tories, Yahoo News UK takes a look.What do the latest polls say?YouGov’s voting intention tracker, updated on Tuesday, suggests the Tories and Reform UK are neck and neck.With Labour well ahead on 38%, the Tories are trailing on 18% – compared to a high of 53% under Boris Johnson in 2020 – with Reform UK just behind on 17% and the Liberal Democrats on 15%.However, there are multiple polls taking place at any one time by a number of different companies.According to the PA news agency, an average of all polls that were carried out wholly or partly during the seven days to June 13 puts Labour on 43%, 21 points ahead of the Conservatives on 22%, followed by Reform on 14%, the Lib Dems on 10% and the Greens on 6%.And while Reform’s average is up one percentage point on the figure for the previous week and the Tories are down one point, there is still an eight-point gap, on average, between the two.Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?Unless something remarkable happens, in short: 'No' - and that's because of the first past the post (FPTP) voting system in which the candidate with the largest number of votes in their constituency is elected.According to the Electoral Reform Society, which is against FPTP, this system leads to a situation where “even if millions of voters support the same party, if they are thinly spread out across the UK they may only get the largest number of votes in a couple of these contests – so only win a few MPs"".“Tens of thousands of voters supporting a different party, but who live near each other, could end up with more MPs. This means the number of MPs a party has in parliament rarely matches their popularity with the public.”Rishi Sunak on the campaign trail on Wednesday. (AFP via Getty Images)Farage knows this well. As the leader of UKIP in the 2015 election, he saw his party win 12.6% of the nationwide vote and one seat. The Liberal Democrats won 7.9% of the vote... and eight seats.Indeed, YouGov last week released a poll – put together using the multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) surveying technique, from a sample size of nearly 60,000 respondents – which suggested the Tories would win just 140 seats, having won 365 in 2019. But this is still 140 more than the zero it projected Reform UK to win, in spite of its strong polling figures.The model had Reform UK ""performing strongly in a number of seats but still a long way off winning in any"", with projected second-placed finishes in 27 constituencies.YouGov's MRP projection. (YouGov)Granted, this model was formed between 24 May and 1 June, before Farage's headline-grabbing intervention on Monday last week in which he announced he would be standing as an MP.But, even as Reform UK polls closer than ever to the Tories, it's difficult to imagine the party winning more than a handful of seats.Chris Hopkins, director at polling firm Savanta, told Yahoo News UK that in one respect, Reform UK is at an advantage compared to Ukip in 2015 because ""Ukip took votes from both Labour and the Conservatives, and we are not seeing that with Reform UK – they are all coming from the Conservatives.""That is the consequence of Rishi Sunak making immigration a centrepiece of the campaign and failing to deliver on it. Even if you have voters that are neutral on immigration, they would say the small boats policy has been a disaster.""But even so, Hopkins said, Reform UK is still ""at a huge electoral disadvantage"" in that its votes are not very concentrated, they are very evenly spread.""There are going to be some races where Reform UK is strong - the Nigel Farage factor in Clacton is really interesting - but realistically its ceiling is five seats: and that’s a high ceiling.""Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey on a campaign visit in Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire, on Wednesday. (PA)Like Reform UK, Sir Ed Davey’s Liberal Democrats are performing well in the polls.In a sign of how defensive the Tory campaign is becoming, one online party advert claims voting for Reform UK or the Lib Dems could give Labour 100 extra seats, resulting in the biggest majority in its history.It depicts a scenario where the Conservatives are beaten into third place behind the Lib Dems, with just 57 seats, despite getting 19% of the vote and without Reform winning a single seat.Read more: Pollsters got it wrong in 2015, so could Labour’s lead be overestimated? (The Guardian)However, it remains unlikely the Lib Dems will finish second. YouGov’s MRP poll projected the party performing strongly, winning 48 seats. This would be up 37 from 2019, but still nowhere near the Tories’ projected 140.However, amid all this talk about projections, it’s worth remembering they are still only polls and not a definite indicator of how people will vote on 4 July. The 1992 and 2015 elections are notable examples of how polling didn’t match the end results of Tory wins.What is proportional representation?Proportional representation, as defined by the UK parliament, is an electoral system ""in which the distribution of seats corresponds closely with the proportion of the total votes cast for each party. For example, if a party gained 40% of the total votes, a perfectly proportional system would allow them to gain 40% of the seats.""This differs from the first past the post system, as set out above, in that a relatively high vote share rarely corresponds with increased seats for the smaller parties. In 2019, for example, the Lib Dems won 11.5% of the vote but only 1.7% – 11 – of the 650 seats.Unsurprisingly, both Reform UK and the Lib Dems support proportional representation.The Lib Dems this week made it part of their manifesto, with the party saying it would introduce the single transferrable vote method, a form of proportional representation which allows electors to rank their preference of candidates on the ballot.The party previously sought to change the UK’s voting system while in the coalition government under then-leader Nick Clegg, but voters rejected the plan in a 2011 referendum.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

Yahoo News UK,"Who is Richard Tice? Reform’s former leader turned Farage sidekickThe candidate for Hartlepool has seen his party's popularity swell in recent months, with one poll showing reform ahead of the Conservatives.",[],Andrew Naughtie,Updated 14 June 2024 at 6:45 am·6-min read,14,June,2024,06:45:00,6,"Now that Nigel Farage has taken over as the leader of Reform UK, Richard Tice’s public profile is fading fast - but the Reform chairman remains involved in the party's operations.So far, the party has only one MP, Conservative defector Lee Anderson. But a recent poll has shown Reform overtaking the Tories, raising the possibility Anderson could hold his seat and even end up with fellow Reformers in the next Parliament.As the candidate for Hartlepool, where he stood as the Brexit Party candidate in 2019, Tice hopes to be one of them. So who is he, and what does he stand for?Childhood and educationBorn in Surrey in 1964 to James Tice, a showjumper, and Joan Tice, a horse trainer. Educated at the private boarding school Uppingham, he studied at the University of Salford, gaining a degree in construction economics and quantity surveying – teeing him up for a career that he said would ""continue the family genes in the property industry"".Family (partner & kids)Tice has three children from a 24-year marriage that ended in divorce. He is now in a long-term relationship with the right-wing writer and journalist Isabel Oakeshott.She is perhaps best known for two notorious incidents that set her against leading Tories: a book that featured the heavily disputed allegation that David Cameron had engaged in sexual activity with a pig, and the release of embarrassing messages entrusted to her by Matt Hancock when she agreed to write a book with him.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election? Full list mappedThe key issues that will decide the electionWhen is the first UK general election TV debate?What is purdah? The strict rule that governs what politicians can and can't sayNet worthWhile not quite in the same league as Rishi Sunak, Tice is one of the wealthiest people in British politics. As he describes it on his website, he made his multi-million-pound fortune over the course of “30 years of making things happen in property investment”, starting with a graduate job at a London firm in 1987.According to Tice, the company he leads as CEO, Quidnet Capital, has “bought and managed £500 million in commercial properties across the UK on behalf of clients”.He was also a key figure in the redevelopment of London’s Nine Elms district, near Battersea Power Station, a controversial project that has transformed a stretch of the Thames’s south bank with a welter of rapidly erected high-rise blocks.GB News linksAlong with Nigel Farage, Lee Anderson and several MPs on the right flank of the Tory party, Tice is a regular on the hard-right, culture war-focused TV outlet GB News. There he hosts a programme called “Richard Tice’s Sunday Sermon”, which serves as a platform for him to deliver his political analysis without the interruptions of an interviewer.However, despite the network being a relatively safe space for him in ideological terms, Tice’s appearances aren’t always amicable. A recent interview with host Andrew Pierce, a longtime right-wing commentator, saw him challenged fiercely about Reform’s chances in a summer election should one be called – with Pierce pointing to the “weirdos” selected by the party to fight numerous seats as evidence the party is “not ready”.Richard Tice, pictured in 2018 at a 'Leave Means Leave' campaign event, is focused on the issue of immigration. (Steve Finn/WENN)Tice was also involved in an incident that saw the network deemed in breach of broadcasting regulator Ofcom’s impartiality regulations, specifically an interview in which a former Brexit Party MEP failed to “sufficiently challenge” his views on immigration.The regulator is under increasing pressure to crack down on GB News heading into the election, with critics arguing it cannot be allowed to broadcast shows that feature Tory and Reform MPs interviewing each other without alternative points of view represented.Tice on NHSThe state and future of the NHS set to be one of this election’s main battlegrounds, and Reform’s key health policy is to spend £17 billion on the NHS on top of its current budget in an effort to get waiting lists down to zero. It also proposes introducing tax relief on private healthcare – something that has been criticised by opponents as a creeping step towards the privatisation of healthcare writ large.Tice’s stated rationale is that the reason the service is struggling is because the money it needs is being spent on other things that the public do not in fact support. Top of the list is Net Zero, which the party and its predecessors have long decried as a pointless “woke” project.In April, Tice used a press conference to frame the choice starkly. “We have a choice in this country, it seems to me,” he said. “A pretty clear choice. Do we want zero waiting lists in two years, and to keep them there? That is the Reform choice. Or do we want net zero CO2 emissions in 25 years? That is the Labour choice.”Tice on immigrationImmigration is by far Reform UK’s top issue, with the party looking to build on Farage’s two decades of campaigning against it in its legal and illegal forms.As far as the election goes, Tice and the party are targeting the continuing arrival of small boats of people travelling across the English Channel, many of them seeking asylum. He has criticised the government for failing to stop “mass immigration” post-Brexit, and described Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda policy as “a disaster”, arguing on GB News that its supposed deterrent value was revealed to be zero just hours after the House of Commons finally passed the law.Reform chairman Richard Tice (L) and leader Nigel Farage speak at the party's economic policy launch at Church House in London. (Alamy Live News)“Within a matter of hours more boats, absolutely packed full, overfilled with illegal migrants, were setting off from the beaches. And we learnt on Tuesday morning that sadly five people, including a young child, drowned leaving the beaches. That's not a deterrent. That's an absolute disaster.”Instead of deporting people to Rwanda, he is arguing for a “pick up and take back” policy that would see small boat arrivals deposited back on French soil. As evidence that this is both practical and humane, he has cited similar policies deployed in the US and Australia.However, he has not addressed the fact that Australia’s policy has been criticised internationally for leaving so-called “boat people” confined to facilities on the island of Nauru, where there have been incidents of suicide and self-immolation.Tice on cost of living crisisPerhaps unsurprisingly given he is trying to peel away former Tory voters, Tice has criticised recent Tory prime ministers harshly for overseeing Britain’s intense cost of living crisis. In 2022, he accused then-prime minister Boris Johnson of “waffling” over the situation. “Clueless, out of touch, no ideas, no help,” he tweeted. “Shocking.”He has also warned that the prospect of a “disastrous” Labour government will offer no prospect of meaningful relief for struggling households.Instead, Reform proposes lifting the minimum level of income tax to £20,000 while cutting various other taxes – among them fuel duty, another gesture to the party’s rejection of environmentalism as a top priority."
Yahoo News UK,The Tory ministers and 'big beasts' who could lose MP seats in the electionSeveral big names in the Conservative Party are at risk of losing their seats in the general election.,"['Grant Shapps', 'Penny Mordaunt', 'Liz Truss', 'Jacob Rees-Mogg', 'Johnny Mercer', 'Victoria Prentis', 'Alex Chalk', 'David TC Davies']",Andy Wells,Updated 20 June 2024 at 0:51 am·5-min read,20,June,2024,00:51:00,5,"Rishi Sunak could become the first prime minister to lose his seat in a general election, according to new bombshell polling.According to the Savanta poll, which was commissioned by The Telegraph, the Conservatives are projected to win just 53 seats in the general election. Some three-quarters of the Cabinet would lose their seats in that scenario – including Sunak.Were Sunak to lose his seat in Richmond (Yorks), it would make him the first prime minister in history to lose their seat in a general election, according to the Institute for Government. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is also facing a battle to hold on to his constituency, with the vote on a “knife edge”.Savanta spoke to around 18,000 people between 7 June and 18 June for their poll. If reflected in the election, Labour would be on course to win 516 seats, with a commanding Commons majority of 382. The Liberal Democrats would have nearly as many seats (50) as the Tories.Jeremy Hunt: My constituency is on a knife edgeHunt could be among the Conservative casualties on the night of the 4 July poll, despite his newly-created seat in Godalming and Ash currently holding a Conservative majority of more than 10,000.

(PA)Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons, is another Tory MP whose name has been mentioned in a future leadership contest – in the event of the Tories losing the election. However, she may not even be an MP after 4 July as her Portsmouth North seat is at risk.Seen as “leaning Labour”, polling suggests Labour are on 42%, compared to the Tories on 34%. She won 61.4% of the vote in the 2019 election.Liz TrussFormer prime minister Liz Truss may not be an MP after the election. (PA)Former prime minister Liz Truss is at risk in her South West Norfolk seat. The seat is seen as a “toss up”, with Truss currently in the lead at 31%. Labour are a sitting at 27% but Reform UK are polling 30%.Allowing for margins of error and another two weeks of campaigning, the seat will be hotly contested between all three parties on 4 July.Jacob Rees-MoggJacob Rees-Mogg is on track to lose his seat at the general election. (PA)While no longer a government minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg losing his North East Somerset and Hanham seat would perhaps be one of the night’s bigger surprises. Rees-Mogg has been an outspoken critic of some of Sunak’s policies and is a regular presenter on GB News.However, the Ipsos poll has the seat, which has been newly-created for the 2024 election, is currently showing a “likely Labour” win, with the party on 47%, compared to 30% for the Conservatives.Johnny MercerPolling suggests Johnny Mercer will lose his seat to Labour at the election.

Yahoo News UK,Keir Starmer: 'I would pay for baby formula being stolen by desperate mum in shop'The Labour leader said the Conservative Party should feel 'shame' over people resorting to stealing baby formula.,"['How much has shoplifting risen in the UK?', 'How much is the cost of living crisis to blame?']",James Hockaday,23 June 2024 at 7:00 pm·5-min read,23,June,2024,07:00:00,5,"Sir Keir Starmer has said that if he witnessed a mother attempting to shoplift baby formula, he would offer to pay for it.The question was put to the Labour leader by the Big Issue, which also asked prime minister Rishi Sunak, the Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey and Scottish first minister John Swinney what they'd do in the scenario.It follows reports of a surge in shoplifting and other criminal offences following the cost of living crisis, which has seen soaring inflation and sharp price rises for everyday essentials.The price of baby formula has reached ""historically high"" levels, with some supermarkets placing security tags on the products, and the Competition and Markets Authority watchdog launching a market study to help consumers.Asked what he would do if he saw someone trying to steal baby formula, Starmer told the Big Issue: ""I’d offer to pay it. The desperation of families around the country should make the Tories feel nothing but shame.”Read more:Asda shop bans ‘granny trolleys’ in crackdown on theft (The Telegraph)Co-op store put on lockdown after would-be shoplifters turn 'violent' (Southern Daily Echo)The scandal of London's disappearing police stations (The Evening Standard)Tory leader Sunak said: “Shoplifting is not a victimless crime, and we’ll always support shopkeepers to prevent theft. At the same time, we will continue to help parents with the cost of living.”Liberal Democrat leader Davey said: “I’d try and try to persuade [the parent] not to, obviously... Try and find them other help, that would be the best way of doing it.”Meanwhile SNP leader and first minister of Scotland John Swinney said: “I’d discreetly offer to pay for the formula as no parent should ever have to face this situation... Sadly this is not hypothetical – I meet with my constituents, and people across Scotland, every week who face this kind of hardship.”How much has shoplifting risen in the UK?According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), shoplifting offences recorded by police in England and Wales have risen to the highest level in 20 years.Some 402,482 offences were recorded in the year to September 2023, up nearly a third (32%) on 304,459 in the previous 12 months.A survey by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) puts the figure even higher, reporting a record high of 16.7 million shoplifting incidents in 2023.The trade-association's claim that only 36% of retail crimes are reported to police, and additional data from Scotland, could explain the discrepancy with the ONS figures.Respondents to the survey suggested that pressures caused by the cost of living crisis could be encouraging people to steal multiple items at a time instead of one or two.'We’ll always support shopkeepers to prevent theft,' Rishi Sunak said. (Alamy)How much is the cost of living crisis to blame?A recent report by the London School of Economics (LSE) shows a clear link between a 10% rise in the cost of living and increases in violence, robberies, shoplifting, burglary and theft over the past year.The study points to previous academic literature which suggests a link between economic hardship and crime, although it acknowledges the relationship is complex and multifaceted"".It found that with a 10% rise in living costs, there was an 8% increase in crimes including burglary and theft and some violent offences.However, the study pointed out that while there appeared to be a correlation between the cost of living and these crimes, this is not the same thing as causation.It found that some crimes, including antisocial behaviour offences, had fallen, and that there had been an overall a 2.4% decrease in calls to the police.Referencing the study in March 2024 as he called on the government to tackle the root causes of crime head-on, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: “The causes of crime are complex. But the overall formula is pretty simple: Too much inequality and too little opportunity produces criminality.""That’s not – and nor should it ever be – a justification for criminal behaviour. If you break the law of course you should pay the consequences. Nor does it imply that all those in poverty turn to criminal behaviour.Tory cuts have consequences. New research shows a clear link between the cost-of-living crisis and crime. We urgently need a national strategy to tackle the complex causes of crime, invest in our broken criminal justice system and support victims.pic.twitter.com/oiukLXem0H— Sadiq Khan (@SadiqKhan) March 15, 2024""But if we want to be sincere about making our city safer, we need to be serious about crime prevention. That begins with acknowledging that no one just wakes up in the morning and – out of nowhere – harms another person with a knife or steals a car… joins a criminal gang or breaks into someone’s home. The clock begins ticking long before the crime is committed.""In January 2024, policing minister Chris Philp said inflation was “no excuse at all” for people to resort to crime, telling Sky News: “We have a very generous benefits system. We are spending well over £100 billion a year on working age benefits. They went up by 10% in April this year.""They are going up by another six or seven per cent in April. The national minimum wage is going to go up by 10%. There is no excuse at all for any criminal activity including shoplifting.”However, according to the Big Issue, his claims don't stand up to examination. Pointing to research by the Trussell Trust and Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF), Universal Credit claimants were on average £35 a week short of the money they needed for essentials like food and heating.The findings, based on conservative estimates, found that a single person needs around £120 per week to cover essentials before housing costs, but would only receive £85 each week on universal credit.Benefits were set to increase by 6.7% under measures announced in April, although 180,000 claimants working less than half of a full-time week will be required to look for more work in an attempt to get people off welfare.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

I feel very optimistic about the fact that we can reconcile those two things and move forward together as a country.“If we have a political culture that’s about bringing people together – and navigating our way through these conversations with respect, genuinely listening to different perspectives, rather than seeing these differences as divisions to be exploited.” (Sky News)Minister accuses broadcaster of suggesting ‘someone is guilty until proven innocent’ when asked about betting scandal08:42 , Jabed AhmedChris Heaton-Harris has accused a broadcaster of “trying to suggest someone is guilty until proven innocent” when asked why Rishi Sunak would not take robust action over the betting allegations.Asked whether the Prime Minister should ask Craig Williams when he placed his bet, the Northern Ireland Secretary told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It wouldn’t surprise me in the slightest if that conversation has been had but you asked me if I knew, and I don’t.”Mr Heaton-Harris added he would not provide any extra comment on an ongoing investigation when asked if Mr Sunak is confident the bet was properly placed.Asked why the Prime Minister cannot take what former minister Tobias Ellwood has called “robust action”, he told presenter Mishal Husain: “I think what you’re trying to suggest is that someone is guilty until they’re proven innocent and that is not how this works.”Voters will be looking at tax plans not betting scandal, minister claims08:25 , Salma OuaguiraA Tory minister has said voters at the general election will be looking at who is planning to cut taxes and immigration, not the betting scandal engulfing the party, Archie Mitchell reports.Northern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris was asked by BBC Radio 4’s Today programme whether the scandal would cost the Conservatives seats at the election.Mr Heaton-Harris said: “I actually don’t know… people decide how they vote on a whole host of things. I would imagine most people will be looking at whether they want a Conservative government that will reduce their taxes or a Labour government that will increase them.“Whether they want a Labour government that will no doubt bring higher immigration figures and what they’ll cut immigration.”Labour: ‘People are literally pulling their own teeth out’08:24 , Salma OuaguiraWes Streeting has said that “people are literally pulling their own teeth out” becuase of the state of NHS dentists.The shadow health secretary added that Labour would “get the British Dental Association in to start the process of long overdue contract reform”.“Because I think what will shock people, especially those who’ve either paid through the nose for private dentistry, or have been priced out altogether, is that last year there was a £400 million underspend in the NHS dentistry budget,” he said.Tory minister admits betting scandal is ‘not great’ and distracting from campaign08:10 , Salma OuaguiraA Conservative minister has admitted the election betting scandal engulfing the party is “not great” and is distracting from the campaign, Archie Mitchell reports.Asked how damaging the Gambling Commission’s investigation has been, Northern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris told LBC: “It’s not great. We should be talking about how we are going to lower taxes and immigration.”But the minister defended Rishi Sunak’s decision not to suspend the two Tory candidates involved in the scandal, saying it is up to the Gambling Commission’s investigation.He claimed candidates are “innocent until proven gulilty” and added the Gambling Commission investigation should be respected.Pressed about Craig Williams, who admitted he put a bet on the July 4 date, he said the party has to wait until he is found guilty by the watchdog as “we don’t know whether he did that with prior knowledge.” (LBC)Everything we know about Tory election betting scandal08:00 , Salma OuaguiraEverything we know about Tory election betting scandalCabinet minister accuses Labour of trying to pressure the Gambling Commission07:50 , Salma OuaguiraChris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland Secretary has accused Labour of trying to “pressure” the Gambling Commission as they investigate into the Tory general election betting scandal.The minister said Pat McFadden’s letter to the watchdog at the weekend urging to release the name of the candidates was “pretty concerning”.He told Times Radio: “It has said it is investigating offences in relation to the date of the election, that it is an ongoing investigation and that it won’t provide any details at this time and it is not confirming or denying the identity of any individuals concerned. And it is right that it has an investigation. It is an independent body.“I actually think, I saw that the leader of Labour’s campaign, Pat McFadden, wrote to try and put some undue influence on the Gambling Commission over the weekend and I think that is actually pretty concerning in itself, Labour trying to lean on yet another independent body like it leant on the Speaker of the House of Commons to not have a vote on Gaza.“I think you are beginning to see, people are beginning to see, what a Labour government would actually be like in the United Kingdom.”Tories: ‘No doubt betting scandal will cost party seats'07:45 , Salma OuaguiraConservative candidate Tobias Ellwood has said the ongoing Gambling Commission inquiries into bets on the general election date are “deeply unhelpful, self-inflicted distraction”.Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Tobias Ellwood said “in what world they thought this was acceptable is beyond belief”.He said the row will “in no doubt” cost the already struggling party in the polls several seats on July 4.Cabinet minister criticises Labour’s VAT on private schools07:42 , Salma OuaguiraNorthern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris has said Labour’s plan to impose VAT on private school fees is “unwise”.The Cabinet minister has said the plans could cause a pupil exodus ti state schools and put more pressure on the sector.Asked if he believed the policy was “unfair”, the Northern Ireland Secretary told Sky News: “I think that is unwise certainly. I think people who have saved hard, worked hard, want to spend extra money on their children;’s education should be allowed to.“I actually think it is a very bad policy because it also means lots of children would be entering… a state education system which is doing really well but is not ready to cater for thousands of extra pupils coming in at this time.”Northern Ireland Secretary: ‘I am not a betting man'07:30 , Salma OuaguiraNorthern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris has denied being a “betting man” while being pressed on the Tory gambling scandal.Speaking on Sky News Breakfast, he said: “I don’t mind people betting on things they don’t have knwoledge about.”Mr Heaton-Harris, who is not running on the general election, added that people found guilty of betting on the general election date will be suspended but not while the investigation is ongoing.

Nobody ‘poked the bear with a stick’.“The people of Ukraine voted overwhelmingly in 1991 to be a sovereign and independent country.“They were perfectly entitled to seek both Nato and EU membership. There is only one person responsible for Russian aggression against Ukraine – both in 2014 and 2022 – and that is Putin.“To try to spread the blame is morally repugnant and parroting Putin’s lies.”Former prime minister Boris Johnson criticised Nigel Farage (Andrew Boyers/PA) (PA Wire)Senior Tories turn on Rishi Sunak over failure to get a grip on election betting scandalSunday 23 June 2024 23:00 , Tom WatlingSenior Tories turn on Rishi Sunak over failure to get a grip on betting scandalThe great election turn-off: the true scale of millennials and Gen Z who won’t voteSunday 23 June 2024 22:00 , Matt MathersHuge numbers of younger people feel disenfranchised by the political parties and are not going to vote, exclusive polling for The Independent shows.According to research carried out by Techne UK, around four in 10 people – 41 per cent – aged 18 to 34 have either not registered to vote (24 per cent) or are registered but have decided not to go to the ballot box (17 per cent) next month.Full report:The great election turn-off: the true scale of millennials and Gen Z who won’t voteICYMI: Farage accused of ‘playing into Putin’s hands’ as he doubles down on Ukraine invasion commentsSunday 23 June 2024 21:00 , Matt MathersRishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer have led criticism of Nigel Farage after the Reform UK leader claimed that the West “provoked” Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.It did not stop Mr Farage from doubling down on his comments, originally made in a BBC Panorama interview which aired on Friday night, in a column piece on Saturday afternoon for the Daily Telegraph, claiming that he should “not be blamed for telling the truth about Putin’s war”.Full report:Farage accused of ‘playing into Putin’s hands’ as he doubles down on Ukraine commentsListen: Tory aide describes Rwanda policy as ‘cr**’ in leaked recordingSunday 23 June 2024 20:00 , Matt MathersListen: Tory aide describes Rwanda policy as ‘cr**’ in leaked recordingPhillipson: Electorate are ‘genuinely disgusted’ by betting scandalSunday 23 June 2024 19:20 , Tom WatlingShadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson has said there is “genuine disgust” among voters over the General Election betting allegations.Asked if she had ever put a bet on a political event, Ms Phillipson told the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: “No, I don’t think, it’s only a few occasions in my life where I’ve ever gambled full stop, it’s not really my thing.“I don’t think that’s really the point.

And we believe that it’s immoral as well.“It’s unbelievable that the Conservative government has already spent £290 million on this scheme, that amount of money alone could have paid for nearly seven million GP appointments.“So, Liberal Democrats would reinstate safe and legal routes so that genuine asylum seekers can apply to come to this country in a safe way.“We would scrap the Rwanda scheme and reinvest that money into the Home Office so we can tackle the backlog and get those claims down.”Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper during a campaign visit to Farncombe, in the Godalming and Ash constituency (Will Durrant/PA Wire)Top James Cleverly aide describes Rwanda deportation plan as ‘crap’Sunday 23 June 2024 17:00 , Matt MathersA top aide to James Cleverly has described Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda deportation plan as “crap”, a leaked recording has revealed.James Sunderland, Tory candidate for Bracknell and the home secretary’s parliamentary private secretary, said he has been immersed in the policy for two years, repeatedly calling it “crap”.Full report:Top James Cleverly aide describes Rwanda deportation plan as ‘crap’ If the EU learnt the lessons of the Habsburg empire then Brexit might not have happened, says descendantSunday 23 June 2024 16:30 , Matt MathersWhen Eduard Habsburg-Lothringen was at school, his history teacher would be going through an episode in Europe’s chronicles and note: “That’s something Mr Habsburg surely knows about.”He would be referring to the many events linked to the 850-year history of the Habsburg empire which touched almost every corner of Europe right up until the end of the First World War.Full report:If EU learnt from Habsburg empire Brexit might not have happened, says descendantMeet Rishi Sunak’s Labour Party opponent who hopes to bring the PM downSunday 23 June 2024 16:00 , Matt MathersThe man who could become the face of the greatest shock in British political history has claimed that whether he wins or not, there is a “bubbling undercurrent” of change in the electorate which means once safe Tory strongholds will fall.Tom Wilson is the 29-year-old Labour candidate running against Rishi Sunak in Richmond and Northallerton who, according to polls last week, could be the first electoral “king killer” – in that he may be the first person to defeat a sitting prime minister in a general election.Full report:Meet Rishi Sunak’s Labour Party opponent who hopes to bring the PM downReform UK overtakes Tories among GB News viewersSunday 23 June 2024 15:20 , Matt MathersReform UK has overtaken the Conservatives and has moved into second place among GB News viewers as the party preferred to form the next government.A new poll carried out by JL Partners shows that the Labour Party is still the top choice among viewers and is holding a 13-point lead.Labour was supported by 38 per cent of people polled, which was down 8 points on the previous poll carried out in late May.Reform are up 7 points on 25 per cent, 1 point ahead of the Conservative Party on 24 per cent.The Liberal Democrats are up 2 points to 8 per cent and the Green Party up 1 point on 3 per cent.Watch: Labour’s Bridget Phillipson sends message to JK Rowling after author accuses party of ‘abandoning’ womenSunday 23 June 2024 15:04 , Matt MathersBridget Phillipson sends message to JK Rowling after ‘abandoning’ women commentBetting scandal shows there’s ‘no leadership’ at top of Tory party, former MP saysSunday 23 June 2024 14:49 , Matt MathersThe betting scandal shows there is “no leadership” at the top of the Tory party and “confirms” Rishi Sunak has failed to uphold “standards in public life,” a former MP has said.Anne Milton, former MP and ex-Conservative whip, told Times Radio: “It confirms views about the fact that the Conservative party hasn’t upheld standards in public life.
