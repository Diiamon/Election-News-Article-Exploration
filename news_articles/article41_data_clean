The Telegraph,When disinformation might really have swung an election,[],Michael Coren,4 July 2024 at 5:28 am·4-min read,4,July,2024,05:28:00,4,"I’m not sure that anything can now help poor Rishi Sunak, but surely a letter a few days back from the Russian foreign minister alleging Moscow’s backing for Keir Starmer would have done just a little good. And it would have been a fitting way to celebrate the centenary of the infamous Zinoviev Letter.In 1924 the Labour Party had formed its first government. It was a minority administration, dependent on the Liberals, and was under siege from its formation. While party leader and Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald was moderate, pragmatic, and certainly anti-communist, he and his party were constantly accused of being overly sympathetic to Moscow.Their decision to normalise Britain’s relationship with the Soviets, only seven years after the Russian Revolution, however, fuelled paranoia about “Bolshevik influence”, and this fear even extended to some within the security services. It was partly the notion that Labour was too close to the Soviets that led to the MacDonald government losing a confidence vote and having to go to the people.Four days before the election, the Daily Mail published a letter ostensibly from Grigori Zinoviev, head of the Communist International in Moscow, the dreaded Comintern. It ordered the Communist Party of Great Britain to commit acts of sedition and argued that, “A settlement of relations between the two countries will assist in the revolutionising of the international and British proletariat not less than a successful rising in any of the working districts of England, as the establishment of close contact between the British and Russian proletariat, the exchange of delegations and workers, etc., will make it possible for us to extend and develop the propaganda of ideas of Leninism in England and the Colonies.”It sounds like a parody today but at the time was taken seriously, even by some who claimed to be experts. The Soviets were in fact anxious to build closer ties with Britain, but less due to ideology than to Russia’s poverty and desperate need for loans and financial support. As a result, Zinoviev himself quickly and officially denied that the letter was genuine. But as anti-Communists said at the time, well he would say that wouldn’t he.Although Labour leaders were understandably furious, their eventual vote wasn’t especially damaged by the letter, with supporters either not believing its authenticity or not caring even if was true. The party also ran more candidates than before, so the overall tally was higher.The Conservatives were always strong favourites to win but certainly attracted voters who were genuinely frightened of what would happen if a Labour government formed closer ties with Moscow. The major victim of the letter was probably the Liberal Party, already in a rapid decline. These “red scare” tactics pushed many of their usual voters into the hands of the Conservatives.But it also led to a lasting Labour Party suspicion of British as well as Soviet Communism, and a determination to emphasize the non-Marxist nature of British social democracy, something that was only interrupted when Jeremy Corbyn became leader. Partly as a result of the letter, the new Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin distanced his government from Moscow, and the Soviet Union became increasingly isolated.That would have delighted the writers of the letter, who were almost certainly white Russians, monarchists, or other emigres who wanted to discredit the Labour Party and prevent Britain from aiding the Soviets in any way. The Zinoviev Letter was a hoax, and that so many people believed and continued to believe its authenticity says more about popular paranoia and credulity than about the letter’s verisimilitude.Within a few years, Stalin controlled the Soviet Union, incarcerated and killed millions, and oversaw a forced starvation of Ukraine. Courageous people wrote genuine letters about what was going on inside the country, but they were usually given far less acceptance than the Zinoviev forgery.As for Ramsay MacDonald, he would go on to be Labour Prime Minister once again between 1929 and 1931 and then lead a National Government until 1935.In 1934 Grigory Zinoviev was arrested, put on trial, and accused of crimes against the Soviet Union. The following year, after torture and humiliation, he was ordered to plead guilty to various outlandish and absurd charges. He said he would do so if his life was spared. “That”, said Stalin, “goes without saying.”He was then executed."
Yahoo Finance UK,What Labour needs to do for pensions and work if it wins election,"['Personal finance', 'Tax', 'Work', 'Pensions', 'Watch: How to save money on a low-income']",Sarah Coles and  Helen Morrissey,4 July 2024 at 7:23 am·6-min read,4,July,2024,07:23:00,6,"A new government could have a big impact on personal finance, pensions and tax. (WPA Pool via Getty Images)The first 100 days of any leadership are crucial. It’s the honeymoon period, where a new government can make relatively controversial changes without a dramatic backlash. It’s a chance to set the direction of the government. If the polls are right and Labour gets to form the next government, it must hit the ground running.Personal financeThere’s one economic policy Labour has pledged to get started with on day one: the reform of the planning system. It’s complex and will involve cooperation from a huge number of bodies and organisations. It makes sense to hit it with a new broom on day one when radical change is most achievable.ADVERTISEMENTRead more: What the Tory and Labour election manifestos mean for your moneyLabour will bring back housing targets and reform the planning system. It’ll strengthen rules requiring more affordable homes to be built and ensure first-time buyers can buy properties on new developments before they are sold overseas. It will also bring in a permanent mortgage guarantee scheme for those with smaller deposits.Labour has also pledged to end leasehold properties – which it dubs fleecehold - and to tackle ground rents. It will end no-fault evictions for renters and allow renters to challenge unreasonable rent increases and raise standards.TaxAfter that, the new government will want to get started before they break up for the summer. As soon as it can be squeezed into parliamentary time, we’ll see the roll-out of VAT on private schools.Labour has pledged that there will be no tax rises for working people. It has ruled out rises to income tax, National Insurance and VAT. However, it won’t tackle the misery of frozen tax thresholds, so pay rises will continue to push more people into paying more tax. On top of this, there are other tax freezes and temporary cuts due to come to an end that Labour hasn’t pledged to extend, including the 5p cut in fuel duty and the stamp duty holiday set to end next March.Labour didn’t rule out changes to capital gains tax either, leading to speculation of other potential tax rises. Tax tinkering is a temptation for any government and it could become even more so if it doesn’t get the growth needed to avoid a squeeze on government finances towards the end of the parliament.Story continuesRead more: How to choose between saving and investing your moneyUnless it’s designed with people’s needs at the centre, however, it runs the risk of putting them off doing the right thing for them and their finances in the long term. Tax reforms need to support the behaviours that make the most sense for individuals and produce the best outcomes. It also needs to have simplicity at its core.Regardless of how much more simple the system gets, people will still need some help with their finances. Right now, firms can provide guidance, but they can’t personalise it or use it to drive people towards specific outcomes, without it being classified as advice. Once it enters this territory, it needs to conform to rules that end up pricing most people out of the market. The Financial Conduct Authority and the treasury have been reviewing the boundary between guidance and advice and this is an opportunity to make a firm decision and bring more support to more people.There may also be steps on energy bills. Labour has pledged to reduce standing charges, double investment to upgrade the energy efficiency of homes and introduce higher efficiency standards for rented homes. While much of this will take time, some steps towards standing charge reform could be put in place sooner.WorkWe’ll also see movement on workers’ rights, a key part of the manifesto. Labour will ensure the minimum wage takes account of the cost of living and end age bands, so all adults receive the same minimum wage. It will also ban zero-hours contracts; end fire and rehire; and, introduce rights to parental leave, sick pay, and protection from unfair dismissal from day one. Expect some steps before the summer recess.Read more: The retirement income gap no-one is talking aboutOnce it’s back from the break, the next fixture in the calendar will be the autumn Budget. Here, the new government will have the opportunity to make much-needed changes. There are some priorities which could dramatically improve people’s finances.PensionsLabour has pledged a review of pensions to ensure the system works well for everyone. Expect a further move towards consolidation of workplace schemes and we want to see more movement on the development of the Lifetime Pension. This could help solve the lost pension problem, by allowing people to keep the pension provider of their choice throughout their career. It’s a move that will stoke competition in the market and help people engage with their pensions.We also want to see changes to auto-enrolment. The extension bill got Royal Assent last year and these changes have the ability to boost pension savings by enabling people to start saving at 18, with contributions coming from the first pound of earnings. This is a prime opportunity to get this process moving again.The pension tax system will also need to be reviewed. Labour’s decision to step back from reintroducing the Lifetime Allowance was welcomed, but more needs to be done. Over the years, constant tinkering has led to a complex system that can make it hard to plan long-term. An overarching review needs to look at the whole system and make sure people are properly incentivised to save without fear of being tripped up by tax changes further down the line.Read more: What Labour’s ‘U-turn on lifetime allowance’ means for your pensionLabour pledged to keep the triple lock, but that doesn’t mean the state pension will remain untouched. An ageing population has led to a burgeoning state pension bill and the government needs to be wary of not placing too much of a burden on the shoulders of an already pressurised working population. With life expectancy slowing and healthy life expectancy hovering around age 63, the government will find its hands tied in terms of future boosts to the state pension age. Ideally, the state pension needs to be part of any pension review to put it on a long-term sustainable footing.There should also be consideration of the self-employed– a forgotten group when it comes to pensions. They aren’t included in auto-enrolment and many miss out on pension saving. Added to this, the prospect of tying money up in a pension until the age of 55 can be a deterrent. This means the self-employed lack financial resilience when it comes to retirement, with Hargreaves Lansdown's latest Savings and Resilience Barometer showing only 23% of self-employed households are on track for a moderate retirement income.Read more: What is the lifetime ISA? How the retirement income option could help youReforms to the Lifetime ISA (LISA) regime could be particularly useful to this group. LISA savings can be accessed early if needed, subject to a 25% exit penalty. This can be helpful during times when earnings are fluctuating, but the issue is that the 25% penalty not only removes the government bonus but a slice of your savings too. We are calling on the government to reduce this penalty to 20% to prevent this from happening. We would also like to see the age at which you can access a LISA increase from age 40 to 55, to cover those who become self-employed later in life. Our research shows that around 1.2m households with a self-employed person paying basic rate tax could be helped by these changes.Watch: How to save money on a low-incomeDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."
The Guardian,#ukpolitics: how the 2024 general election has played out on TikTok,"['Straight TikTok: ‘traditional’ news for a new audience', 'IB TikTok: the newbie newsmakers', 'Native creators: the individuals posting about politics', 'The PoliTikTokkers: the parties and candidates winning TikTok', 'Conspiracy theorists']","Carmen Aguilar García, Pamela Duncan, Michael Goodier and Zeke Hunter-Green with videos by Elena Morresi",4 July 2024 at 6:08 am·9-min read,4,July,2024,06:08:00,9,"If a week is a long time in politics, the five-year gap between UK elections is an eternity. The political landscape has changed dramatically since the Tories’ landslide victory in 2019 – but so too has the social media landscape.In 2019 TikTok was, according to a Guardian explainer, “a video-sharing app which has become phenomenally popular with teenagers”.Fast-forward to 2023 when, according to an Ofcom survey, 10% of people aged 16-plus said they received their news from TikTok, ahead of BBC Radio 1 and on a par with the Guardian, and up significantly from 1% in 2020, after the last election.And while there are those who say the so-called battle for TikTok is overstated, platform creators are well aware there is an audience for political content among TikTok users, young and old.To help understand how the 2024 election played out on TikTok, we monitored the platform using four separate accounts for an hour a day for a week, searching for the widely used tag #ukpolitics and campaign-specific hashtags and terms.Some disclaimers before we begin: no one outside TikTok knows how its algorithm works, and we do not know whether – and if so, how – it can be manipulated to boost certain content.The platform is also notoriously difficult to measure. It has no “most popular” section, meaning our sample was just that: a snapshot of what we saw on the site for an hour each day for a week of the campaign.Straight TikTok: ‘traditional’ news for a new audienceIf you have the impression that TikTok is all about dance crazes, lip-sync challenges and MUA tutorials, then you’d be right … but you’ll also discover some familiar faces, among them BBC and ITV news anchors, LBC radio hosts and broadcast journalists.Traditional news outlets including TV broadcasters (BBC, ITV, Sky News), newspapers (the Guardian, the Telegraph and the Daily Mail) and radio stations (LBC and Greatest Hits Radio) have all leveraged the platform as part of their election offerings.In the main, these organisations are repackaging their news content into the bitesize chunks favoured by the platform, sometimes fronted by younger journalists presenting, summarising the news of the day or vox popping.But some media organisations are posting content which is more native in tone. The Daily Mail lives up to its bio (“Seriously Popular”), attracting the most engagement (defined as the sum of an account’s likes, shares and comments) on a per-video basis in the video content captured in our snapshot.Metro’s strategy has also proved successful: its main account, metrouk (“We give the people what they want”) enjoyed the highest number of views per video and the second-highest engagement captured in our sample.A secondary Metro account, alrightgov, was placed seventh in terms of engagement in our overall sample, posting video snippets in answer to the question its bio poses: “What on earth is going on in the House of Commons?”Overall, among the 339 “traditional news” videos posted after the election was called on 22 May and served to us in our week on TikTok, these publications were averaging 245,000 views a video, although they scored much lower in engagement at 14,000 a video.IB TikTok: the newbie newsmakersThere is also a strand of TikTok news content that is most definitely IB (inspired by) the platform’s homegrown content.Some were accounts that grew out of the platform, so are native to it. Others had a disruptive presence in the media landscape before joining the platform. But in both cases, this kind of content tends to feel much more at home on TikTok.Chief among this latter disruptive sub-category is Politicsjoe – an offshoot of the Joe website and its associated social accounts – which ranked in 13th place in our sample for views and engagement per video, and within the top 10 for news providers.While Politicsjoe does not enjoy the dizzying highs of the Metro and Mail accounts, its content rivals the TikTok accounts of the Telegraph, BBC and LBC for views, and ranks above ITV’s.And it isn’t the only one: news disruptors, usually posting a combination of news/infotainment, ranked highly in our snapshot include the News Movement and Novara Media.A word here also for podcasts such as The Rest is Politics and The News Agents, which attracted healthy numbers for views and engagement on their election-related posts.Native creators: the individuals posting about politicsThe 2024 election campaign has thrown up a number of controversies but very few surprises. The exception to this rule has been Nigel Farage’s apparent infiltration of the youth platform and the Reform UK party’s apparent popularity among 18- to 24-year-olds across a number of polls.Our sample indicates that engagement with rightwing content on the platform extends to individuals and not just politicians.Of the top 20 individual creators (ranked in terms of views per video), 13 were rightwing or right-leaning content creators compared with five on the left of the political spectrum; the others were neutral in their views expressed on election-related posts.Rightwing accounts also tended to attract more engagement (likes, shares and comments). When ranked by engagement, eight of the top 20 individual creators promoted rightwing candidates or views compared with just four leftwing creators – although it should be noted that engagement here does not equal support.Among the best-performing accounts in terms of individuals’ election content was that of the former Ukip leader Henry Bolton.Ahead of this election Labour made a call on TikTok: “The problem is that almost everyone on TikTok is already on our side,” a campaign source told the Guardian.And – as is unsurprising for a youth-facing platform – the leftist politics of certain accounts do indeed do well.The most popular of those accounts we captured – thechampagne_socialist – posted six election-related videos in the period analysed, getting more than 40,000 views a video and more than 6,300 engagements for each piece of content posted.Other TikTokkers posting content leaning more towards the left (or at least delighting in the Conservatives’ poor poll ratings) and who were also among the top 20 accounts in our sample of individual creators were leftbrainuk and mrcodydahler, but these two and thechampagne_socialist were all outperformed by rightwing/right-leaning content creators.Despite some of the above creators’ tendency to wear their bias on their sleeves, there are still corners of TikTok in which creators are doing their level best to be on the level with their audience.These include the TikTokker Chris Chandler, who shares news on his account Newswithchrisofficial, the account bestvidsukgb which mainly posts funny videos, and Louis, a university student in his final year running the account instanational_elections.The PoliTikTokkers: the parties and candidates winning TikTok Although TikTok presents itself as an entertainment app, recent elections outside the UK show how the platform is being utilised by political campaigns.Far-right parties are having some success in attracting younger voters. A quarter of the 2019 EU MEP cohort with TikTok accounts were part of the rightwing and far-right European political groupings.Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), which enjoyed unprecedented support in the recent European elections, has mastered the platform’s format of posting short, emotional videos.Jordan Bardella, the president of Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally, which could become the largest force in the French parliament, has been described as the king of TikTok in French politics.Therefore it is no surprise that, when capturing content using the #ukpolitics and election-related hashtags and terms, we also hoovered up a lot of content created by (or at least on behalf of) politicians.And while the Labour and Conservative posts captured in our sample did well on both views and engagement, more worryingfor liberals was how often Reform candidates surfaced, accounting for seven out of the 13 top political accounts.However, we cannot see into why certain posts and accounts fare better than others on the platform.“TikTok’s search engine shows personalised results, making it difficult to understand what is actually seen by users on their screens. Moreover, the recipe of the algorithm behind these search engines is kept secret,” said Salvatore Romano, the head of research at the investigative non-profit organisation AI Forensics.Conspiracy theoristsWe found very few accounts circulating conspiracy theories, at least in the sample we collected, but they did exist.  We are not going to help the conspiracy theorists by amplifying their videos more broadly on this platform, but the topics we saw included the fictitious claim that Labour would introduce sharia law if it was brought to power.Again, we cannot tell why we were being served this content, although AI Forensics warns that such content can be amplified by the “secret recipe” hidden in the platform’s algorithm.“Since engagement can be both positive and negative, polarising debates around extreme opinions, and even hate speech, can boost engagement metrics,” said Romano.At least three accounts that we originally designated as containing conspiracist tropes were removed during the course of our research, although we cannot say if that was by their own volition or if they were taken down by TikTok.MethodologyThis project sought to measure how political content was being disseminated on TikTok in the run-up to the UK general election on 4 July 2024.It does not purport to give a comprehensive picture of the campaign to date, instead giving us a snapshot of the election coverage on the platform.The content was gathered using four TikTok accounts. Two of them were trained on only political content before engaging in the process; the other two were newly created accounts.Each team member monitored the site for about 15 minutes each, staggered across the days between 10 and 18 June inclusive, capturing TikTok content associated with the hashtags and terms ""ukpolitics"", ""ukge2024"", ""ukgeneralelection"",""election 2024 uk"" and ""ge2024 uk"" posted since 22 May, the day after the election was announced.This trawl captured 5,122 videos. After videos posted before the election were called were removed, 3,470 unique videos posted by 2,038 users remained. A further cull removed irrelevant accounts, most frequently those using the #ukpolitics hashtag to spam users.The final analysis concentrated on the 100 most prolific accounts captured in our snapshot.LimitationsOnly public videos and not those published privately by the accounts are traceable. TikTok displays between 250 and 300 videos on each search page, which each of the four team members scrolled through daily to capture the associated links in a process which took about 15 minutes each time."
The Guardian,UK political parties on track to spend £1m on election day online ads,[],Jim Waterson,4 July 2024 at 7:11 am·3-min read,4,July,2024,07:11:00,3,"The UK’s political parties are on track to spend more than a million pounds on online adverts on Thursday, circumventing a media blackout rule that forces television and radio stations to stop their election coverage when polls open.British parties have traditionally ceased top-level campaign activity when voting began as they had no way to get out their message out. This is due to a longstanding broadcasting rule, enforced by the media regulator Ofcom, that states: “Discussion and analysis of election and referendum issues must finish when the poll opens.”The switch to online campaigning over the last two decades has increasingly made a mockery of this rule, with early indications suggesting political parties are viewing Thursday as an incredibly important campaign day for pushing their core messages to wavering voters.Sam Jeffers of WhoTargetsMe, which has monitored election advertising in the UK for the last decade, said substantial funds had been released for Thursday. “The parties are on track to spend a million pounds today on Meta and probably another £250,000 on Google,” he said.If these figures are correct, it could mean that more money is spent by political parties buying online political advertising on polling day than was spent online during the entire 2015 general election campaign.Labour has bought adverts on the homepages of more than 50 websites, including the Sun’s, urging people to vote for change. The party is also continuing to run adverts on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and the free version of Spotify, with the theme of reassuring people that it’s safe to back the party.The Conservatives are spending hundreds of thousands of pounds pushing localised Facebook adverts warning about the risks of a Labour “supermajority”, while Nigel Farage is campaigning for Reform UK by tweeting out policies and uploading TikToks of him having a pint of beer.By comparison, broadcasters have been limited to factual reporting of politicians including Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer posing in front of their local polling stations, along with information about how to vote.This means that a voter who listens to podcasts and watches YouTube will feel the election is still being fought hard. But a member of the public who tunes in to the lunchtime television news or switches on the radio will get a different impression, with more analysis of the US presidential election than the UK contest.Michael Crick, the former Channel 4 News political correspondent, said the ban on election day coverage was “a relic from the dinosaur age of the 1950s”, especially because a quarter of voters were likely to have already returned their ballot by post anyway.He said the rule should now be abolished on the principle of media freedom, because it was a hangover from 70 years ago. “It was the broadcasters who imposed the rules on themselves, because they were worried they would be accused of bias. Up until 1958 they could not even cover an election campaign,” he said.Because the rules were written before newspapers transitioned from print to the internet, there is also a two-tier system for online coverage which heavily restricts what can be put on broadcasters’ websites. While most news outlets, such as the Guardian, are free to run analysis and campaign coverage throughout polling day, the BBC’s online offering is restricted to telling people how to vote – and sharing pictures of them voting with their dogs.It remains illegal for any individual or news outlet, punishable by a maximum of six months’ imprisonment, to publish exit polls based on how people said they voted before the polls have closed."

At this point, broadcasters will announce the results of the combined BBC, ITV and Sky News exit poll. By 4am there should be enough votes in to know which party is on course for victory.Here is a breakdown of exactly when to expect the key results on general election night:The election is being held using new constituency boundaries, which means the results cannot be compared directly with what happened at the last general election in 2019.To measure how well the parties do at the election, and to determine which seats they need to win to form a government, a set of notional results for the 2019 election has been calculated to show what would have happened if that contest had taken place using the new boundaries.All majorities and swings mentioned below are based on these notional results, which have been compiled by Professor Colin Rallings and Professor Michael Thrasher of the University of Plymouth, on behalf of the BBC, ITN, Sky News and PA news agency.10pm - Voting closes followed by exit pollPolling stations close, followed immediately by the publication of the joint exit poll from the BBC, ITV and Sky News.It will offer the first clues as to how the night will unfold. At each of the past few elections, the exit poll has produced a very accurate projection of the actual result.Meanwhile, counting begins at venues across the UK for all 650 election results.(PA Graphics)11pm - First seats declaredThe first seats to declare are likely to be Blyth & Ashington at around 11.30pm and Houghton & Sunderland South at around 11.45pm. Both are in North East England and both are being defended by Labour.Houghton & Sunderland South has been won by Bridget Phillipson for Labour at every election since the seat was created in 2010. She is defending a narrow majority of 3,271.Blyth & Ashington is a new constituency at this election, with Labour defending a notional majority of 6,118.The outcome may provide a guide as to what to expect in seats where Labour has small majorities – in particular how Reform UK performs and what happens to the level of Conservative support.Want to make sense of the general election results once they’re in?

Former justice secretary Sir Robert Buckland is defending a majority of 5,650 and Labour candidate Heidi Alexander – who was MP for Lewisham East from 2010-18 – needs a swing of 5.7 percentage points to win.Opinion polls suggest this is the sort of seat Labour ought to win comfortably, and as such the result will be a pointer for what could happen over the rest of the night.(PA Graphics)Basildon & Billericay in Essex is another result due at around 12.15am. Conservative Party chair Richard Holden is the party’s candidate due to a decision made by party officials just two days before the nominations deadline, to the anger of some local party members. The Tories are defending a 20,749 majority.Broxbourne in Hertfordshire is due at around 12.30am. The seat has been held continuously by the Conservatives since its creation in 1983, with a majority in 2019 of 19,192. The result will give an early indication of how the Tories are faring in their traditional Home Counties heartlands.1am - How does Scotland fare?East Kilbride & Strathaven, Hamilton & Clyde Valley and Rutherglen will provide a first indication of patterns of voting in Scotland.All three are being defended by the SNP and all are Labour targets, with Rutherglen needing a 6-percentage point swing to change hands, Hamilton & Clyde Valley 8.2 points and East Kilbride & Strathaven 12.8 points.A direct swing in the share of the vote of 10 percentage points from the SNP to Labour in Scotland could see Sir Keir Starmer’s party pick up 15 constituencies.(PA Graphics)Elsewhere, the Liberal Democrats could make their first gain of the night in Harrogate & Knaresborough, which they last held between 1997 and 2010 and where they need an 8-percentage point swing to take the seat from the Conservatives, ranking it at number 21 on the party’s target list.Leigh & Atherton in Greater Manchester is ranked at number two on Labour’s target list: a new seat this election, but one where the Tories are defending a notional majority of just 293.2am - It all kicks off The flow of results will now start to pick up, with just over 60 seats due to declare between 2am and 3am.A win for Labour in Tory-held Cannock Chase in Staffordshire, expected to declare at around 2.30am, would suggest the party is on course for a record-breaking win: the seat needs an enormous 21.5-percentage point swing to change hands, ranking it at number 304 on Labour’s target list.The party held the seat from 1997 to 2010 but it has been Tory ever since, with a 2019 majority of 19,879.The Lib Dems should discover whether they have been able to gain one of their longshots, Stratford-on-Avon, from the Conservatives: a seat they need a 17.8-point swing to win and which was held until this year by former Tory chancellor Nadhim Zahawi, who is not standing this time.Workers’ Party leader George Galloway will learn if he has held on to Rochdale in Greater Manchester, which he won at a by-election in February.Results from Sir Keir Starmer’s constituency of Holborn & St Pancras is due at around 2.30am (AFP via Getty Images)The result from Sir Keir Starmer’s constituency of Holborn & St Pancras is due at around 2.30am. The Labour leader is defending a very safe majority of 22,766 and is one of 12 candidates standing in the seat.Mid Bedfordshire, due to declare at around 2.45am, was won by Labour from the Tories at a by-election in October 2023, marking the first time Sir Keir’s party had represented the seat since its creation in 1918.Based on the size of the swing Labour needs to win again (when compared with the 2019 notional result), the seat ranks at number 263 on the party’s target list – so a Labour victory here would suggest the party is on track for an enormous Commons majority.Also worth watching will be the results from Bolsover in Derbyshire, held by Labour from 1950 to 2019 – for much of the time by veteran left-winger Dennis Skinner – until the Tories won at the last election, and which Labour will hope to win back; Peterborough and Redcar, two of Labour’s key targets; and Torbay in Devon, which could fall to the Lib Dems if Sir Ed Davey’s party is doing exceptionally well.3am - Watching with bated breathThis is likely to be the busiest time of the night, with nearly 250 declarations expected over the next hour.Islington North is due to declare, where independent candidate and former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is standing. Mr Corbyn has previously won the seat for Labour at every general election since 1983, but is no longer a member of the party and is contesting the seat with six others, including Labour candidate Praful Nargund.The result is due from the new seat of Great Grimsby & Cleethorpes, where the Tories are defending a notional majority of 9,759: the sort of constituency Labour has to win (the swing needed is 11.8 points) to be sure of a comfortable majority.(PA Graphics)Justice secretary Alex Chalk is one of the cabinet ministers most at risk at this election and the result from his seat of Cheltenham is due at around 3am, where he is defending a tiny majority of 1,421.The constituency would fall to the Lib Dems on a swing of 1.3 percentage points, ranking it at number six on the party’s target list.The result is also due at around 3am from Chingford & Wood Green, which former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith has won at every general election (including its former incarnation as Chingford) since 1992, but where he is defending a majority of just 1,604 and which would change hands on a swing to Labour of 1.5 points.Five other candidates are standing, including Shama Tatler for Labour and the Independent Faiza Shaheen, who was Labour’s candidate here in 2019, meaning there could be a partial split in the Labour vote.Sir Ed Davey’s seat of Kingston & Surbiton is due to declare at around 3.15am, where the Lib Dem leader is defending a majority of 11,174.Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey’s seat is due to be declared after 3am (PA Wire)Witney in Oxfordshire, a seat won by the Tories at every election since its creation in 1983 and which was once represented by former prime minister David Cameron, is due to declare at this time – another seat that could fall to the Lib Dems if Sir Ed’s party is having a very strong night.Also due at around 3.15am is the result from Bristol Central: a new seat at this election and one of the Green Party’s top targets, where candidate Carla Denyer is hoping to beat Labour’s Thangam Debbonaire, previously MP for Bristol West.At around 3.30am the result is likely from the new constituency of Godalming & Ash in Surrey, where chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt is one of six candidates. Mr Hunt could be at risk: he is defending a notional Tory majority of 10,720 and the seat has been heavily targeted by the Lib Dems, who need a swing of 9.7 points to win.(PA Graphics)Defence secretary Grant Shapps is another Tory “big beast” potentially in trouble and the result from his Hertfordshire seat of Welwyn Hatfield should come in around this time. Mr Shapps has held the seat since 2005 but is defending a majority of 10,773 and Labour needs a swing of 10.4 percentage points to win.House of Commons leader Penny Mordaunt will find out if she has held her seat of Portsmouth North, which she has represented since 2010. She is defending a majority of 15,780 and a swing to Labour of 17.2 points would see her defeated.Another cabinet minister, education secretary Gillian Keegan, will discover her fate at Chichester. Ms Keegan is defending a majority at this election of 19,622, with second-place party the Lib Dems needing a swing of 19.3 points to take a seat they last held – as the Liberal Party – 100 years ago.Tatton in Cheshire, once the seat of former chancellor George Osborne and held since 2017 by government minister and TV presenter Esther McVey, is due to declare, which would fall to Labour on a 17.4-point swing.Other key seats to watch this hour include Ribble Valley in Lancashire, Thanet East in Kent and Scarborough & Whitby in North Yorkshire – all seats Labour needs to win to be sure of a majority in the next parliament – along with Tory-Lib Dem battlegrounds such as Eastleigh in Hampshire, Wells & Mendip Hills in Somerset and Newton Abbot in Devon, to see how well the Conservatives hold off any potential surge by Sir Ed’s party in south-west England.4am - Time to face the musicEnough results should be in now to know which party is on course to win the election and by what margin.Dartford in Kent is the longest-running “bellwether” constituency in the country and is due to declare at around 4am. Since 1964, whichever party wins Dartford has also gone on to form the government. Conservative candidate Gareth Johnson is defending a majority here of 14,704, with Labour’s Jim Dickson needing a swing of 15.9 points to take the seat.Douglas Alexander, who held a number of cabinet roles during the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, has not been an MP since 2015 but is standing this year in Lothian East, Labour’s top target in Scotland where the SNP is defending a majority of 2,207.Rishi Sunak’s seat of Richmond & Northallerton, in North Yorkshire, should declared at around this time. The prime minister is defending a huge notional majority of 24,331 and is one of 13 candidates standing in the constituency, making it the most contested seat in the country.Clacton in Essex should declare. It is being defended by Giles Watling for the Conservatives and Reform leader Nigel Farage is one of nine candidates. It is Mr Farage’s eighth attempt at becoming an MP.The residents of Ashfield in Nottinghamshire will find out at around 4.30am if their next MP is former Conservative-turned-Reform candidate Lee Anderson, who won the seat as a Tory in 2019; Independent candidate Jason Zadrozny, who came second in 2019; new Conservative candidate Debbie Soloman; or Rhea Keehn for Labour, whose party held the seat from 1979 to 2019.(PA Graphics)Former House of Commons leader Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg will learn if he has won the new seat of Somerset North East & Hanham, where the notional Tory majority is 16,389 and which Labour would take on a swing of 14.3 percentage points, ranking it at number 165 on the party’s target list.The Greens will discover whether they have held on to Brighton Pavilion in East Sussex, where Caroline Lucas was the party’s MP from 2010 to this year, and where their new candidate is Sian Berry.They will also find out if the Greens’ co-leader Adrian Ramsay has managed to win the new seat of Waveney Valley in East Anglia, which is being treated as a notional Conservative defence.A key result from Northern Ireland is due at around 4.30am in Lagan Valley, where Sinn Fein has stood aside in the hope of giving the Alliance Party a better chance of gaining the seat from the DUP.5am - Rayner’s time to shineNorthampton North, a bellwether seat at every general election since February 1974, is due to declare. Labour needs a 3.9-point swing to gain the constituency from the Tories.(PA Graphics)Former prime minister Liz Truss will learn whether she is back in her seat of Norfolk South West, where she is defending an enormous majority of 24,180.The Leicestershire constituency of Loughborough, a bellwether at every general election since February 1974, is due to declare at around 5.30am. Labour needs a 5.9-point swing to gain the seat from the Tories.Also due at around 5.30am is the result from Ashton-under-Lyne in Greater Manchester, where Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner is defending a majority of 4,689.Two of the most remote constituencies in Scotland should declare during this hour: Caithness, Sutherland & Easter Ross and Orkney & Shetland, both of which the Lib Dems are hoping to win, while results should come in for two of Labour’s top London targets: Finchley & Golders Green and Hendon, both held since 2010 by the Conservatives.6am - The final hoursAmong the final results to declare should be the London boroughs of Ilford North and Ilford South, both safe for Labour.Another likely to be called is the new constituency of Selby in North Yorkshire, which Keir Mather – the youngest MP at the end of the last parliament – is hoping to win for Labour and overturn a notional Tory majority of 14,838.Farnham & Bordon, a new seat that straddles the borders of Hampshire and Surrey, which could bring the Lib Dems a late gain at the expense of the Conservatives.7am and later - The morning after Recounts could delay some of the declarations from earlier, but every seat is due to begin counting overnight so there is a good chance all 650 results will be in by mid-morning.Additional reporting by PA"
Yahoo News UK,Who is Ed Davey? The Lib Dem leader whose life has been marked by adversity,"['His early life', 'His family', 'His parents', 'His education', 'Why is he a Sir?']",Hannah Fearn,Updated 1 July 2024 at 11:04 am·3-min read,1,July,2024,11:04:00,3,"The youngest of three boys, Sir Ed Davey had a childhood marked by adversity. His mother died when he was a teenager and his father died when he was just four.As an adult, Davey now cares for his son, who is disabled with a neurological condition.So what do we know about the man who leads the third party in British politics?His early lifeEd Davey was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on Christmas Day in 1965. He was the youngest of three boys, but lost his father at just four years old and then his mother when he was in his mid-teens. She had spent three years battling cancer, during which time he nursed his mother together with his grandmother and brother Henry.Once a keen Scout and Air Scout, he later remembers feeling “isolated” at school because of his caring responsibilities, which meant he couldn’t take part in after-school activities or sports. “The last 18 months she was bedridden and in a lot of pain. I’d spend hours on the bed, talking to her,” he said. Davey was with his mother when she died at Nottingham General Hospital, after being placed on an unsuited dementia ward.After both his parents had died, Davey was brought up by his maternal grandparents in the village of Eakring, though his grandfather died soon after. He spent much of his childhood and young adulthood close to his grandmother. “First of all, she was looking after me. Then we were looking after each other,” he said.His familyDavey married Emily Gasson, a former Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate who unsuccessfully stood in four elections and is now a councillor, in 2005 and the pair have two children, a son and daughter.Their son, John, born in 2007 and now a teenager, is disabled with a neurological condition. He has attended special schools but is now educated at home with a tutor – a change that Davey said led to him becoming verbal for the first time. He has spoken about his anxiety about who will care for his son when he and his wife are no longer around. “It’s the thing that worries me more than anything else in my life,” Davey said.Gasson was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in 2012. She was well for many years following her diagnosis, but declined during lockdown and is working on recovering her physical strength.His parentsEd Davey, pictured with his family. (Liberal Democrats)His father, John, was a solicitor and his mother, Nina, a teacher. Davey has described how he was inspired to study by his mother, who always wanted him to try hard academically and who he wanted to impress.His educationDavey attended the private Nottingham High School, the alma mater of former chancellor Kenneth Clarke. He became head boy, with Labour MP Ed Balls – who was studying in the year below – watching on.After school, he achieved a first class degree in philosophy, politics and economics at Jesus College, Oxford where he was junior common room president. After becoming an economics researcher for the Liberal Democrats he returned to study, reading for a master’s degree in economics at Birkbeck College, London.Ed Davey as Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change alongside the then leader of the Lib Dems, Nick Clegg, and Jo Swinson, pictured during the coalition government in 2015. (Getty)Why is he a Sir?For three years, the Lib Dem leader was a member of the cabinet in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition government, holding the post of secretary of state for energy and climate change from 2012 to 2015. He was knighted in the 2016 New Year’s Honours for “political and public services”."

If you haven’t already registered to vote you’ve already missed the deadline and won’t be able to cast a ballot this time around.But, you can still apply for an emergency proxy vote as late as 5pm on polling day if you are suddenly unable to vote in person, so long as you are already registered.New rules and boundary changes mean you must have a valid photo ID to vote and your constituency may be different to the last election – you can use your postcode to check.Officially, polls close at 10pm, but if you are at least in the queue by then you should still be able to cast your vote past time.After that, votes are taken to counting halls run by the relevant local authority, ready to be sorted.From 10pm media can also start reporting exit polls, which given an early indication of how the parties are performing across the country.When are votes counted?First, ballots have to make it from polling stations to the counting hall, which could take minutes or hours, depending how far they have to travel.Once there, slips are verified to ensure they match data from their polling stations (such as the number of ballots issued throughout the day), before being mixed with postal votes for counting to begin in earnest.When should we expect the first results?A handful of seats usually manage to declare a result before midnight.Traditionally, this honour has fallen to one of the Sunderland constituencies, although at the last two elections, in 2019 and 2017, that crown was snatched by Newcastle Central.This time around, however, Newcastle has reportedly ruled itself out of the running for the top spot.Sunderland is usually one of the first areas to begin announcing election results.So does that mean I can have an early-ish night?That depends. In 2019, one of the most significant results of the night was confirmed barely 90 minutes after close of polls (and that included a recount).There was a similar phenomenon in Sunderland during the Brexit referendum, when the scale of the result on Wearside gave an early indication of the final outcome.But with votes for 650 seats across the UK to count, you might be advised to stay up a little later if you’re really interested.Okay, so when can I think about going to bed?How early do you have to get up the next day?In 2019, returning officers managed to confirm almost 50 seats before 2am – a great improvement on 2015, when the figure was just 17.On the basis of the last two elections (which, like this one, were standalone polls without local authority and other votes going on at the same time, as happened in 2015), the bulk of results came between 2-5am, when results were being declared at a rate of almost three every minute.And will there be a result by then?Maybe. The magic number for a parliamentary majority is 326 seats, although in reality the actual number is slightly lower due to various factors.If a party pulled off the slightly implausible achievement of winning 326 seats consecutively, a result could be confirmed by about 3.30am, again, on the basis of previous elections.In reality, the process will likely take a lot longer.Which will be the last seat to declare?Probably St Ives, in Cornwall, which has taken the wooden spoon in two of the last three elections.In 2015 and 2019 it was well past lunchtime the day after the election before a result was declared.But in 2017 Kensington didn't confirm a shock victory in the seat until 9pm the day after, thanks to three recounts, although by that point the national result was a foregone conclusion.Who is standing in my constituency?Find your constituency on the map below to see the list of the candidates from the main political parties standing in your local area.If you aren't sure of the full name of your constituency, you can quickly search for its name by adding your postcode or location here.You can also check out our searchable database below to see a list of all the candidates standing in your area."
The Telegraph,What time is the exit poll today and when will we know who won the election?,"['What time is the UK exit poll?', 'What is the exit poll?', 'When will today’s election results be announced?', 'When will we know who won?', 'When was the 2019 election result called?']",Jordan Young,4 July 2024 at 5:24 am·4-min read,4,July,2024,05:24:00,4,"Follow The Telegraph’s latest general election live blogWhen polls close today after a six-week general election campaign, Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer will face a tense wait for results from the UK’s 650 constituencies to find out who will become the next prime minister.The exit poll, at 10pm tonight, will give the Prime Minister and the Labour leader a snapshot of what to expect nationally, before the first results start to trickle in across the following hours.Until then, the final opinion polls are in and all of them predict disaster for the Tories. In each case Labour is projected to win by a landslide, with some suggesting Sir Keir could achieve a greater victory margin than Sir Tony Blair in 1997.But there remain uncertainties. The polls are still reporting that on average those who voted Conservative in 2019 are twice as likely as those who voted Labour to say that they do not know how they will vote today.Many undecideds are as unhappy with the Conservatives as those who say they are going to vote differently this time around – they just are not sure what to do as a result.But when can we expect to know the result of today’s election for certain?Read the latest election pollsWhat time is the UK exit poll?The exit poll will be announced at 10pm today, just as voting ends and polling stations across the country close.It offers a unique window on the outcome, and has an impressive track record of accurately forecasting the results.With little campaigning taking place today, talk will turn to lighter subjects such as the dogs spotted outside polling stations, to help pass the time ahead of the all-important exit poll.What is the exit poll?The exit poll is a survey of voters taken from about 150 constituencies in England, Scotland and Wales which gives a strong indication of the likely result.People at each station are approached at random and handed a replica ballot. The voter then privately fills in the ballot to indicate how they voted and puts it into a box.The forecasts made for each constituency are also influenced by what is known about people who live there, for example how they voted in the 2016 EU referendum.When will today’s election results be announced?Most of the constituency results are expected in the early hours of Friday morning, as hundreds are announced across the country, with the final seats projected to announce their winning candidates by 7am.In 2019, the first declaration came at 11.27pm when Newcastle City Council beat local rival Sunderland to announce Chi Onwurah, Labour’s candidate, as the first MP of the new parliament.The record for the earliest declaration remains 10.43pm by the former seat of Sunderland South in 2001.Use our tool below to find out when your constituency is expected to declare:When will we know who won?Around an hour or so after the exit poll at 10pm, results from the election will begin to trickle in, with the first declaration expected to be the new constituency of Blyth and Ashington at 11:30pm.By 3am on Friday, the slow trickle will become a rush. Arguably, this begins the most consequential part of the night, as results are expected from more than two thirds of constituencies by 5am.It should be clear who has won not long after this point, but leaders will have to wait until one party receives enough votes for a majority under the first-past-the-post electoral system before it can be called officially.By 7am almost all the remaining seats will have declared and the country could be waking up to news of a new government in Westminster, or perhaps even a stunning Tory escape from the electoral wipeout pollsters have consistently predicted for them.Regardless of the results, at this point the party leaders will be preparing to address the nation and political commentators will begin an election debrief that is sure to continue for days.When was the 2019 election result called?Boris Johnson won a landslide victory for the Tories in 2019 after selling the public on his mandate to “get Brexit done”.The first exit poll came back as Big Ben struck 10pm and polling stations closed nationwide, while Mr Johnson’s overall majority was confirmed at 5am.By 7am, it became clear the Tories were on course for their biggest majority at Westminster since that of Margaret Thatcher."

Before that, the electorate must take to their local polling stations to cast their votes (if they have not done so already via a postal vote).To ensure everyone gets a fair and equal chance to participate in this democratic process, there are a number of rules in place, which must be followed in and around polling stations.Here’s everything you need to know about polling day:How to vote in the election today: Finding a polling station and filling in a ballotAll eyes on Rishi Sunak’s Richmond and Northallerton seat15:32 , Salma OuaguiraThe prime minister is challenging for the Richmond and Northallerton seat in the Yorkshire Dales which he previously won in 2019 with a majority of more 27,000.He has held the seat in the Yorkshire Dales since 2015, succeeding former Tory leader William Hague.But members of Mr Sunak’s inner circle warned that he could lose in his constituency of Richmond and Northallerton, one of the safest Tory seats in the country.

If his fear comes true, Mr Sunak would be the first sitting PM to lose his constituency.An election eve poll for The Independent predicts a Tory wipeout, saying Sunak may only hold 82 seats in Parliament. Even worse, a mid-June poll suggested the PM might only retain 53 seats.A separate June poll forecasts Mr Farage’s party to beat the Tories, with Reform UK’s popularity seemingly unaffected by Mr Farage’s previous comments about Putin and Ukraine.Mr Sunak is rumoured to be considering a return to the finance industry regardless of his election results.More dogs at polling stations15:01 , Salma OuaguiraA person and a dog wait outside St James’ Church polling station during the general election in Edinburgh, Scotland (REUTERS)Voter Liam Magee carries his dog Freya outside a polling station in west Belfast (AFP via Getty Images)Alliance leader Naomi Long, her husband Michael and their dog Daisy outside the polling station at St Colmcille’s Church (Liam McBurney/PA) (PA Wire)A dog waits outside a polling station as voters go to the polls in the general election on July 04, 2024 in Great Ayton, United Kingdom (Getty Images)What is voter ID and which forms of identification can I use to vote in the General Election?15:00 , Maryam Zakir-HussainVoters have been required to bring photographic identification for certain elections in the UK since May 2023.This came after parliament passed the Elections Act in April 2022, enacting a recommendation the Electoral Commission first made in 2014.Voter ID is now required at by-elections and recall petitions, general elections, local elections and referendums in England, and Police and Crime Commissioner elections in England and Wales.Voter ID: Which forms are acceptable to use to vote in the General Election todayWatch: Count Binface promises 99 ice creams to remain 99p in election plea video14:57 , Salma OuaguiraCount Binface promises 99 ice creams to remain 99p in election plea videoHighest and lowest number of seats won by a single party14:52 , Salma OuaguiraThe highest number of seats won by a single party at an election since 1900 is 418, by Labour in 1997.The second highest number is 412, won by Labour in 2001 and also by the Conservatives in 1924.The highest number of seats won by Labour at general elections (PA Graphics)The fewest seats won by the Conservatives at any general election since the party was formally established in the 1830s is 156 in 1906, followed by 165 in 1997.The Labour Party was founded in 1900 and won two seats in the general election of that year, followed by 29 at the next election in 1906.Since 1945, the number of seats won by Labour has never dropped below 200.The fewest number of seats won by the Conservatives at general elections (PA Graphics)A return to 1997? Yes please, it was one of the best years ever14:45 , Maryam Zakir-HussainIt won’t be long before we find out if Starmer has delivered a 1997-style landslide for Labour, Richard Benson writes. But, that year was exciting for more reasons than politics, says Richard Benson who, as the editor of ‘The Face’ during ‘Cool Britannia’, says we’ll be lucky to experience anything like it again.He writes: “If there’s a difference, between then and now it’s in the mood. Post-pandemic, current-cost of living crisis, people are angrier and more bitter, and that feels intensified by social media, which expresses and fosters hate much better than it does laughter.“By 1997, money had started to come back into the economy, and the ubiquitous spite of social media hadn’t poisoned the national mindset; where 2023 has furious memes, the 1990s had a Viz cartoon about a corrupt Tory called Baxter Basics.”Read the full article here:A return to 1997? Yes please, it was one of the best years everKemi Badenoch hits out at council over postal votes row14:44 , Salma OuaguiraThe business secretary has attacked her local council over missing postal votes after people reported delays in delivery and printing.More than 2,600 paper ballots have been delayed in North West where Ms Badenoch is attempting to get re-elected.The cabinet minister blasted local authorities and accused them of “forgetting to send ballot papers”.Ms Badenoch said: “Five years ago, all but four Conservatives on Uttlesford council were voted out. People wanted ‘Change’. Instead, they got ‘Change for the WORSE’, electing an independent residents group who ran a blame-the-Tories campaign.“The community is now saddled with council leadership unable to carry out basic functions competently. Now they’ve potentially disenfranchised up to 2,600 postal voters by FORGETTING to send them their ballot papers. Don’t change for the worse.”Lots of questions on doorstep today about missing postal ballots in North West Essex and all the shenanigans this might entail.“How could this happen!?” they ask.Well… it’s an interesting parallel given the polls yesterday…..(1/4) 👇— Kemi Badenoch (@KemiBadenoch) July 4, 2024When will we know who’s won? An hour-by-hour guide to general election results and key seat announcements14:30 , Maryam Zakir-HussainAfter a whirlwind six-week general election campaign, the day has finally arrived, with millions heading to the polls to decide the future of the country.In the lead-up to today, the Tories and Labour have scoured the country to secure votes as party leaders Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer battled it out in fierce head-to-head debates.But the campaign trail was shaken by the last-minute addition of Nigel Farage as the new leader of Reform UK, chasing the PM’s tail in shock polls which saw the party only marginally behind the Conservatives in the vote share.Here is a breakdown of exactly when to expect the key results on general election night:General election results: Hour-by-hour guide to when key seats will be called tonightKeir Starmer or Rishi Sunak: Who said what in their general election campaign?14:26 , Salma OuaguiraKeir Starmer or Rishi Sunak: Who said what in their general election campaign?What are the dos and don’ts of election day?14:22 , Salma OuaguiraWith polling stations already open, many voters might be wondering about polling station etiquette. From taking selfies to telling others about how you voted, here’s everything you need to know.You must vote at the polling station to which you have been assigned between 7am and 10pm today. If you are in a queue when the polls shut, you are still allowed to vote.When you arrive, you will receive a ballot paper listing candidates and their respective parties in your constituency. You will have to take it to a screened booth where you will find a pencil to vote with. But you can use your one pen if you prefer.If you make a mistake, you can ask for another ballot paper if you have not put it in the ballot box. Votes made with a tick or even a smiley face can be counted if the choice is clear, but if counting staff cannot read the ballot, it will be disqualified.What can and can’t you do inside a polling station?The Electoral Commission advises against taking a selfie inside polling stations as it can risk accidentally giving away how someone else voted, which is against the law. But people are welcome to share pictures taken outside, even one with their dog. But you are not allowed to take pictures of the ballot paper you receive in a polling station, but you can photograph your postal ballot paper.People can tell others how they voted, but only about their choice and not anyone else’s. The fine for revealing how another person voted is up to £5,000 or six months in prison.However, people with a disability can have a presiding officer, a close family member aged 18 or over or an eligible voter to mark the paper for them. People with a visual impairment can ask for a device that allows them to mark their own ballot paper. A large print version is usually available at polling stations.Politics Explained | Could the Tories really end up being the third-largest party in the Commons?14:13 , Maryam Zakir-HussainAs prominent Tories admit they are facing a heavy defeat, Sean O’Grady looks at the history of the ‘supermajority’ –and the chances that the Conservatives, far from remaining the ruling party, will concede even the role of official opposition, Sean O’Grady writes.He writes: “Even when the situation is hopeless, the leaders of a doomed party in a general election usually try to show a brave face. They have set phrases to rely on in such difficult circumstances: ‘The only poll that matters is the one on polling day.’ ‘All to play for.’ ‘Lots of undecideds out there.’ ‘That’s not what we’re hearing.’ ‘It’s too early to say, let’s see what the results are.’“Indeed, that has been the pattern this year, too – until now. In effect conceding defeat, and a heavy one at that, top Tories are now asking voters to back them to provide a strong opposition to the expected Labour landslide, or “supermajority”, as they’re calling it.”Read the full article here:Could the Tories really end up being the third-largest party in the Commons?How bad could the general election result be for the Tories?14:10 , Salma OuaguiraPollster John Curtice makes final prediction before polls open in general electionLeaders issue final appeals of 2024 UK general election14:00 , Salma OuaguiraContenders to be the next prime minister issued their final appeals ahead of the 2024 UK general election result today.Rishi Sunak, who was spotted this morning voting with his wife in North Yorkshire, made a last bid in the hopes of securing a few seats before the polls close tonight.The current PM said: “Today is a pivotal moment for the future of our country.”Mr Sunak admitted that he knows how “frustrated” people are following an “extremely difficult” few years, “but the answer is not to usher in a Labour government”.Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer was all smiles this morning as he cast his vote in London.Keir Starmer is on track to smash electoral records and lead a landslide majority, opinion polls suggest.In his last campaign bid, he said: “We cannot afford five more years under the Conservatives. But change will only happen if you vote Labour.“Today is the chance to begin the work of rebuilding Britain with Labour.”Party leaders cast their votes as millions head to the polls today (PA)Count Binface: 'July the Fourth Be With You’13:50 , Canqi LiCount Binface, an independent MP candidate describing himself as an intergalactic space warrior, has posted a GIF saying “Bindependence day - time to take out the trash” on X.He added to his post: “July the Fourth Be With You.”July the Fourth Be With You. pic.twitter.com/oRzKXuYmTo— Count Binface (@CountBinface) July 4, 2024Running for MP in his North Yorkshire constituency, 5,702-year-old Count Binface has a manifesto called “Bloody Loyal To Wherever I’m Standing For Election”.

This would far exceed the defeat faced by John Major in 1997, when the number of Conservative seats fell to 165.All outcomes would beat the Tories’ worst election result in history, which came in 1906 when the party won just 156 seats and Arthur Balfour, who had quit as prime minister a month earlier, lost in his own constituency.Our political correspondent Archie Mitchell ad data correspondent Alicja Hagopian have more:Tories heading for armageddon as poll suggests Rishi Sunak will win just 82 seatsJeremy Hunt pleads to be re-elected as ‘strong local voice'12:40 , Salma OuaguiraChancellor Jeremy Hunt has urged voters to re-elect him as a “strong local voice” as he desperately fights to protect his seat.The Godalming and Ash candidate could be at risk of being hit by a huge Tory wipeout in his race against the Liberal DemocratsWriting on X, formerly Twitter, Mr Hunt said: “[I’m] your strong local voice for Godalming Ash...

(Zac Goodwin/PA Wire)Voters concerned about environment and climate change12:19 , Salma OuaguiraWhile experts remind us of the existential threat posed by climate change, polls suggest the issue is only an important priority for about one in five voters, Jonathan Bunn reports. However, that is still a significant number of voters and the environment is an issue that concerns people across the political spectrum.Despite progress in the UK on cutting emissions, the Conservatives will likely have angered many of a green persuasion by introducing new oil and gas licences.Last year the watchdog the Climate Change Committee described efforts to scale up climate action as “worryingly slow”, with Government decisions undermining the UK’s leadership on the issue.Labour has also faced challenges on the environment.The decision to slash its green prosperity plan from £28 billion a year to £15 billion was heavily criticised by environmental groups and unions.Members of the public leave after casting their vote in the 2024 General Election at St James' Church, Goldenacre, in Edinburgh (Jane Barlow/PA Wire)Tory Steve Baker could watch his seat fall12:00 , Salma OuaguiraSteve Baker was appointed minister of state at the Northern Ireland Office on 7 September 2022.

The election of 1900 was the first of its kind to be contested by the recently-formed Labour Party, as well as the long-established Conservative and Liberal parties, and as such can be seen as the first general election of the modern political era.Even larger majorities have been won by coalitions of parties.A three-party National government, made up mostly of Conservatives along with small portions of the Labour and Liberal parties, won a majority of 242 at the 1935 election.Four years earlier in 1931, the same National government won a majority of 492: the biggest ever parliamentary majority at a general election in modern political history.Largest majorities won by single parties at general elections since 1900 (PA Graphics) (PA Graphics)Sir Ed Davey and his wife vote in west London11:02 , Salma OuaguiraLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey and his wife, Emily, have visited a polling station in Surbiton to vote.Sir Ed said “good morning everybody” to the assembled media and waved to the cameras.As the pair prepared to enter Surbiton Hill Methodist Church, a voter left the polling station and wished Sir Ed “good luck”.Sir Ed Davey and his wife Emily Gasson arrive to cast their votes in the 2024 General Election at Surbiton Hill Methodist Church in Surbiton, south west London (AFP via Getty Images)Immigration set to be hotly debated as voters seek action11:01 , Salma OuaguiraImmigration consistently comes in third place in recent polling on voter priorities and is set to be a key battleground in the election campaign, Jonathan Bunn reports. The Government’s Rwanda Bill became law last month, paving the way for deportation flights to get off the ground.This policy and Tory talk of limits on legal migration show the Government is committed to taking a hard line on the issue, despite the risk of alienating more moderate voters.Meanwhile, Labour has said it is also looking to reduce the reliance on overseas workers and backs a points-based immigration system which it says “would work for workers and businesses”.Sir Keir Starmer has been treading carefully on the issue of small boats, saying crossings needed to be reduced “materially” without setting a target.He said a Labour government would expand counter-terror powers to cover people-smuggling gangs and create a new Border Security Command to co-ordinate efforts to halt the crossings.Rishi Sunak said stopping the boats was one of his five priorities last year, but  the number of migrants to have arrived in the UK in small boats across the Channel in 2024 is already approaching the 10,000 mark.With crossings continuing, the Conservatives may have to rely on the symbolic impact of at least one flight to Rwanda rather than firm evidence that the policy is working.The Prime Minister previously said flights to the east African country would not take off before the General Election (PA Archive)Aldi UK jokes about election for Cake Constituency MP10:57 , Canqi LiAldi UK has made a Facebook post featuring a ballot for electing an MP for a fictionary Cake Constituency, writing: “Democracy has never been sweeter #GeneralElection2024”.The featured parties include “The People’s Party”, “Legally a Different Party”, “The Overpriced Avocado Party”, “The Co-operative Party”, “Clubcard Members Party”, “The Attempted Price Match Party”, and “Just Here for a Good Time Party”.The post received more than 200 comments in half an hour, with one commenter writing: “Best ballot paper ever.”Another commenter remarked: “You are sooo naughty, Aldi!

Historically high waiting lists for treatment, ageing infrastructure across the NHS estate and workforce challenges combine to paint a picture of the much-loved health service on its knees.The Government made progress in reducing waiting times, but the scale of the problem means the figures remain at a level many voters will be disturbed by.Meanwhile, Labour promised to cut waiting times and increase appointments and operations.However, the scale of the issues in the NHS, the complexities across the system and wider related services, as well as the scale of funding involved, pose a huge challenge for whichever party wins power.Junior doctors in England began a five-day walkout during the general election campaign (Jordan Pettitt/PA) (PA Wire)Jeremy Corbyn casts his vote in Islington09:55 , Salma OuaguiraThe former Labour leader has cast his vote in Islington North where he is running against his former party.Mr Corbyn was leader of the opposition between 2015 and 2019, has represented the London constituency since 1983.The independent candidate lead the party during the last election, which saw Labour lose with only 202 seats.A Survation poll commissioned for left-wing news website Novara Media just over a week before polling day showed that he is on 29 per cent, 14 points below Labour rival Praful Nargund.Jeremy Corbyn casts his vote in Islington North where he is standing as an independent candidate (@jeremycorbyn/Twitter)Keir Starmer and wife Victoria arrive to cast their votes09:51 , Salma OuaguiraSir Keir Starmer and his wife Victoria have arrived at their constituency in Holborn, London to cast their votes.The Labour leader has all the reasons to be smiling as the polls suggest he could bag a groundbreaking majority tonight.He could enter the doors of Number 10 tomorrow as the new prime minister with an unprecedented 272-seat majority behind him, polls suggest.Sir Keir Starmer and his wife Victoria arrive to cast their votes in the 2024 General Election at Willingham Close TRA Hall in London.

In the here and now, damagingly high inflation has returned to just above the Bank of England’s target of 2%, giving the Prime Minister the opportunity to say the economy is on the right track.However, as Labour is keen to point out, the long period of unusually high inflation has long-term consequences, with lower rates simply adding less to high household costs.The state of the nation’s finances is a key element that both the main parties always claim they can be trusted on, with the Conservative Party historically regarded by voters as the more reliable on tax and spending decisions.But with most notably the turmoil caused by Liz Truss’s mini-budget in 2022, the party faces an uphill struggle to re-establish this reputation.The latest figures show the UK’s overall national debt was £2.69 trillion in April, or 97.9% of gross domestic product, and 2.5 percentage points more than at the end of April 2023.2024 UK general election: Key timings08:33 , Salma OuaguiraAfter six weeks of heavy campaigning, the polls are open and is now the turn of voters to deliver their final say.7am: Polls opened this morning across the United Kingdom.9pm: Broadcasters start their Election Night shows.10pm: Polls close and counting begins.10pm: Sky News, ITV and BBC exit poll is published, revealing the first preview of the election result.11.30pm: First seats between the new Northumberland constituency of Blyth and Ashington, and Houghton and Sunderland South in Tyne and Wear are declared.4.30am on Friday: Final seats around the country are declared.Party leaders make the general election final pitches08:23 , Salma OuaguiraAs we get closer to the finish line, party leaders have made their final pitches of the 2024 general election.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, writing on social media site X as polls opened, said: “Change.

Yahoo News UK,"Will Nigel Farage's Reform UK 'beat' the Tories in the election?With some polling figures putting the Tories and Reform UK nearly neck and neck, could Farage's party really end up with nearly as many MPs as Sunak's?","['What do the latest polls say?', 'Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?', 'Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?', 'What is proportional representation?']",James Cheng-Morris and  Ellen Manning,Updated 14 June 2024 at 3:33 am·7-min read,14,June,2024,03:33:00,7,"Leading pollster John Curtice has poured cold water on suggestions that Reform UK is now beating the Conservative Party in the general election polls.As representatives from seven parties took prepared to take part in a TV debate on Thursday, a YouGov survey for The Times newspaper said Reform’s support had increased by two points to 19%, putting them ahead of the Tories for the first time.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage took the the opportunity to hail the poll results in the debate, declaring: “We are now the opposition to Labour.”But Curtice urged caution, insisting that single polls should not be relied on. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""This is one poll - we’ve actually, I think, had four other polls published in the last 24 hours - none of which have had Reform ahead, not even all of which have had Reform gaining ground, but quite a couple of them certainly suggesting it’s also got very close.""He said it may not be the case that Reform are ahead - and could be on average four or five points behind. But he said: ""This is still bad news for the Conservatives. The only way Rishi Sunak can hope to get even to base camp in narrowing the lead that Labour have started off with this campaign was to squeeze the Reform vote.""He added: ""Rather than making progress, things are actually going backwards, not least of course because of Nigel Farage’s decision to fight this campaign.""With many speculating that Reform UK with Farage at the helm could ""beat"" the Tories, Yahoo News UK takes a look.What do the latest polls say?YouGov’s voting intention tracker, updated on Tuesday, suggests the Tories and Reform UK are neck and neck.With Labour well ahead on 38%, the Tories are trailing on 18% – compared to a high of 53% under Boris Johnson in 2020 – with Reform UK just behind on 17% and the Liberal Democrats on 15%.However, there are multiple polls taking place at any one time by a number of different companies.According to the PA news agency, an average of all polls that were carried out wholly or partly during the seven days to June 13 puts Labour on 43%, 21 points ahead of the Conservatives on 22%, followed by Reform on 14%, the Lib Dems on 10% and the Greens on 6%.And while Reform’s average is up one percentage point on the figure for the previous week and the Tories are down one point, there is still an eight-point gap, on average, between the two.Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?Unless something remarkable happens, in short: 'No' - and that's because of the first past the post (FPTP) voting system in which the candidate with the largest number of votes in their constituency is elected.According to the Electoral Reform Society, which is against FPTP, this system leads to a situation where “even if millions of voters support the same party, if they are thinly spread out across the UK they may only get the largest number of votes in a couple of these contests – so only win a few MPs"".“Tens of thousands of voters supporting a different party, but who live near each other, could end up with more MPs. This means the number of MPs a party has in parliament rarely matches their popularity with the public.”Rishi Sunak on the campaign trail on Wednesday. (AFP via Getty Images)Farage knows this well. As the leader of UKIP in the 2015 election, he saw his party win 12.6% of the nationwide vote and one seat. The Liberal Democrats won 7.9% of the vote... and eight seats.Indeed, YouGov last week released a poll – put together using the multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) surveying technique, from a sample size of nearly 60,000 respondents – which suggested the Tories would win just 140 seats, having won 365 in 2019. But this is still 140 more than the zero it projected Reform UK to win, in spite of its strong polling figures.The model had Reform UK ""performing strongly in a number of seats but still a long way off winning in any"", with projected second-placed finishes in 27 constituencies.YouGov's MRP projection. (YouGov)Granted, this model was formed between 24 May and 1 June, before Farage's headline-grabbing intervention on Monday last week in which he announced he would be standing as an MP.But, even as Reform UK polls closer than ever to the Tories, it's difficult to imagine the party winning more than a handful of seats.Chris Hopkins, director at polling firm Savanta, told Yahoo News UK that in one respect, Reform UK is at an advantage compared to Ukip in 2015 because ""Ukip took votes from both Labour and the Conservatives, and we are not seeing that with Reform UK – they are all coming from the Conservatives.""That is the consequence of Rishi Sunak making immigration a centrepiece of the campaign and failing to deliver on it. Even if you have voters that are neutral on immigration, they would say the small boats policy has been a disaster.""But even so, Hopkins said, Reform UK is still ""at a huge electoral disadvantage"" in that its votes are not very concentrated, they are very evenly spread.""There are going to be some races where Reform UK is strong - the Nigel Farage factor in Clacton is really interesting - but realistically its ceiling is five seats: and that’s a high ceiling.""Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey on a campaign visit in Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire, on Wednesday. (PA)Like Reform UK, Sir Ed Davey’s Liberal Democrats are performing well in the polls.In a sign of how defensive the Tory campaign is becoming, one online party advert claims voting for Reform UK or the Lib Dems could give Labour 100 extra seats, resulting in the biggest majority in its history.It depicts a scenario where the Conservatives are beaten into third place behind the Lib Dems, with just 57 seats, despite getting 19% of the vote and without Reform winning a single seat.Read more: Pollsters got it wrong in 2015, so could Labour’s lead be overestimated? (The Guardian)However, it remains unlikely the Lib Dems will finish second. YouGov’s MRP poll projected the party performing strongly, winning 48 seats. This would be up 37 from 2019, but still nowhere near the Tories’ projected 140.However, amid all this talk about projections, it’s worth remembering they are still only polls and not a definite indicator of how people will vote on 4 July. The 1992 and 2015 elections are notable examples of how polling didn’t match the end results of Tory wins.What is proportional representation?Proportional representation, as defined by the UK parliament, is an electoral system ""in which the distribution of seats corresponds closely with the proportion of the total votes cast for each party. For example, if a party gained 40% of the total votes, a perfectly proportional system would allow them to gain 40% of the seats.""This differs from the first past the post system, as set out above, in that a relatively high vote share rarely corresponds with increased seats for the smaller parties. In 2019, for example, the Lib Dems won 11.5% of the vote but only 1.7% – 11 – of the 650 seats.Unsurprisingly, both Reform UK and the Lib Dems support proportional representation.The Lib Dems this week made it part of their manifesto, with the party saying it would introduce the single transferrable vote method, a form of proportional representation which allows electors to rank their preference of candidates on the ballot.The party previously sought to change the UK’s voting system while in the coalition government under then-leader Nick Clegg, but voters rejected the plan in a 2011 referendum.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

Many also assume his title is hereditary.Here's what you need to know about the personal life of the man who wants to be the UK’s next prime minister.His early lifeStarmer was born in Southwark, south London, in 1962, as the second of four children. His parents were Labour Party members and named him after Keir Hardie, the party’s first leader in parliament.The family moved out of the capital and he grew up in Hurst Green, a village just outside the small Surrey town of Oxted. He was active in youth politics from his teenage years but was also a skilled musician, taking music lessons alongside Norman Cook, who later became better known as a member of The Housemartins and the DJ Fatboy Slim.Starmer played the flute, piano, violin and recorder and was a junior exhibitioner at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.His familyStarmer with his wife, Lady Victoria Starmer, at the Labour Party Conference in October 2023. (Alamy)Starmer is married to Victoria, a former solicitor who later retrained in occupational health and now works for the NHS. The pair met through their work in the law in the early 2000s and married in Essex in 2007.She was first seen accompanying her husband when the couple were filmed clapping for carers during the pandemic in 2020 outside their home in Camden. They have two children, a son and daughter, but both are kept out of the public eye.Victoria's father was Jewish and originally came from Poland, while her mother converted when they got married. Starmer has said in a previous interview that ""my wife in particular wants our children to know the faith of her family"" and that they ""observe some of the practices, for example Friday night prayers"".His parentsKeir Starmer with parents, Rodney and Josephine, at his graduation. (Twitter/Keir Starmer)The Labour leader's father, Rodney Starmer, worked as a toolmaker in a factory, and his mother Josephine Starmer (née Baker), was a nurse.His father worked 14-hour days but spent his time outside work caring for Josephine, who was diagnosed with the autoimmune condition Still’s disease. She required two hip and knee replacements twice in her lifetime and struggled with arthritic pain.As a young man Starmer also helped care for his mother, which he has said led to him being more emotionally reserved. His sister, Katy, recalled: “He’s had to be a grown-up all his life. I’ve always been quite open about my feelings – Keir is good at most things, but not that.” Josephine Starmer died in 2015, and his father three years later.His educationA photograph of a younger Starmer as shown on ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories in 2021. (ITV)Starmer passed the 11-plus examination, and attended Reigate Grammar School from age 11. While he was at the school it became an independent fee-paying institution, but as an existing student he was exempt from fees, and his tuition in the sixth form was covered by a bursary.After school he studied law at the University of Leeds, this first in his family to attend university, graduating with a first class degree in 1985. He undertook postgraduate law studied at the University of Oxford, where he served as editor of a radical magazine, Socialist Alternatives.Why is he a Sir?Keir Starmer pictured in 2010, when he was director of public prosecutions, making a statement about MPs who face charges over their expenses claims.

In 2008 he was appointed head of the Crown Prosecution Service and DPP.During his tenure he chose to prosecute three Labour MPs and a Conservative in the wake of the parliamentary expenses scandal, and was responsible for prosecuting former MP Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce for perverting the course of justice after Pryce claimed responsibility for her former husband’s speeding offence."

His Indian parents both arrived from East Africa in the 1960s. A football-mad boy whose childhood idol was Matt Le Tissier, Sunak was described by the family’s neighbours as a child with “lovely manners”.In his youngest years, the PM attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. According to a recent biography, fellow pupil Ollie Case said: “He was someone that was talked about.

(Getty Images, photo taken in 2022)Perhaps unsurprisingly for someone with such an unblemished record, he went on to become the school’s head boy. Sunak worked while studying, delivering medicines for his mother’s pharmacy and as a waiter at a local Indian restaurant.After school, Sunk read philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, graduating in 2001 with a first class degree. While still at university he held an internship at the Conservative Party campaign headquarters and joined the party, but went on studying before entering politics.He earned his MBA from Stanford in 2006 as a Fulbright Scholar, meaning he was selected among the most promising candidates from the UK.How much is he worth?Rishi Sunak's mother is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.As prime minister, Rishi Sunak earns £80,807 on top of a salary of £84,144 for being an MP. But his current income from Westminster pales in comparison to his family’s vast wealth through marriage.The Sunday Times valued the couple’s joint fortune at £730m. Murty's father is the co-founder of Infosys, an Indian tech conglomerate, in which she holds shares estimated at around £430m. Her family is also involved in a £900m business arrangement with Amazon in India, and she is a shareholder of multiple other companies.Before entering politics Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and a series of hedge funds. He is also known to have invested in blind trusts, in which investments are made without holders knowing where the funds are located. These arrangements reportedly hold Sunak’s own multi-million-pound fortune.Sunak, his wife Akshata and daughters Anoushka and Krishna (second left) at Santa Monica Pier, California, on their summer holiday in 2023.

The Guardian,French elections: what is the republican front – and will it head off National Rally?,"['What is the “republican front”?', 'When did the republican front first emerge?', 'How often has it been deployed since?', 'Has it always been successful?', 'Will it work this time?']",Jon Henley Europe correspondent,4 July 2024 at 6:00 am·5-min read,4,July,2024,06:00:00,5,"After Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) topped the first round of France’s snap general election, parties of the left and centre called for a front républicain (republican front) against the far right party and urged voters to faire barrage (block its advance).The terms, and the practice, have existed in French politics for decades. But what is the republican front, when has it been deployed – and how well does it work?What is the “republican front”?The term is ill-defined and the strategy can take different forms, but in French politics the “republican front” describes a combined effort by several mainstream political parties and their voters to minimise the far right’s chances of winning an election.Related: Will France fall to the far right? – podcastIn the second round of presidential elections, and in other elections when only two finalists reach the run-off stage, parties that did not make it will ask their voters to support the mainstream candidate. Voters have tended – although in decreasing numbers – to comply.When the far right is well-placed in a runoff for which three candidates have qualified, which can happen in all elections bar the presidential poll, the “republican front” is more concrete: third-placed candidates can agree to withdraw so as not to split the anti-RN vote.Such agreements can be local or national, and once again rely on voters to make them work. Whatever their political preferences, they are invited to “block” a far-right victory by voting for whichever candidate is left standing against the far right party.The republican front is so named because the RN is seen as “anti-republican”, on the grounds that its French-first plans for a “national preference” in jobs and benefits, and some of its anti-immigration proposals, run contrary to constitutional principles of equality.When did the republican front first emerge?Most historians date the first to 1955, during the Fourth Republic, when four centre-left and centre-right parties formed an electoral pact to beat the populist, anti-taxation, anti-modernisation, anti-parliamentarian UDCA of Pierre Poujade.The term was first used by Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, a journalist from l’Express magazine, then picked up by Le Monde. Fun fact: one of the more influential members of the defeated UCDA was a certain Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marine’s father.How often has it been deployed since?The republican front and the barrage have been deployed in differing forms in municipal, departmental, regional, parliamentary and presidential elections since the 1980s, as the vote share of RN – known then as the National Front (FN) – began to rise.In the second round of departmental elections of 1985, for example, the Socialist party (PS) of the prime minister, Michel Rocard, called for a “democratic pact”, urging leftwing voters to block FN candidates by voting for the mainstream centre-right party.The apogee of the republican front is widely considered to be the 2002 presidential elections, when, in a political earthquake, the NF leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, reached the second round at the expense of the Socialist party prime minister, Lionel Jospin.Every party in the national assembly called on its voters to support the candidate of the centre-right UMP party, Jacques Chirac, who went on to win a second term in the Élysée palace with a score of 82%.Has it always been successful?The republican front has weakened steadily since 2002. In 2011 local elections, the rightwing president, Nicolas Sarkozy, urged his party’s voters to choose “neither FN, nor PS” in the second round, because the Socialists had made local alliances with far-left parties.In the run-off between Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen for the 2017 presidential election, only two of the nine parties knocked out in the first round – the PS and the centre-right Les Républicains (LR) – formally called on their voters to back Macron.In the second round of the 2022 presidential elections, a repeat of 2017, as RN continued to steadily increase its vote share at almost every ballot, two other far-right candidates, Éric Zemmour and Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, urged their voters to back Le PenThe defeated centre-right, centre left, Green and Communist candidates all called on their voters to cast their ballots for Macron, but Jean-Luc Mélenchon of the radical left Unbowed France (LFI) issued a subtly different appeal, urging his to “vote against RN”.Macron won with 58% – a long way from Chirac’s 82%. And in the ensuing parliamentary elections, the president’s camp resurrected Sarkozy’s “neither … nor”, refusing to tell its voters how to vote in run-offs between RN and the leftwing alliance that included LFI.Will it work this time?The RN’s 33% first-round snap parliamentary election score drew instant calls for a republican front for Sunday’s second round and 221 candidates, including 83 from Macron’s camp and 132 from the left-green NFP alliance, have stepped down from potential three-way runoffs.However, while polls suggest this has significantly reduced RN’s chances of an absolute majority in the assembly, the front continues to fracture.Related: France’s ‘hard left’ has been demonised – but its agenda is realistic, not radical | Julia Cagé and Thomas PikettyCompared with 2022, Mélenchon was clear: NFP voters should cast their second round ballot for the non-RN candidate. However, Macron allies, including former prime minister Édouard Philippe, have said their camp’s voters should not back an NFP candidate from Mélenchon’s LFI, and the centre-right LR has refused any recommendation, saying the “far left is the real danger”.Meanwhile voters – particularly those on the left, who have now voted twice for Macron and centrist candidates to faire barrage against the far right – will once again be asked to hold their nose and cast their ballot for candidates whose policies they do not support, while centrists must vote NFP.The front républicain may just hold this time, but it will not hold for ever."
Yahoo News UK,"Who is Richard Tice? Reform’s former leader turned Farage sidekickThe candidate for Hartlepool has seen his party's popularity swell in recent months, with one poll showing reform ahead of the Conservatives.",[],Andrew Naughtie,Updated 14 June 2024 at 3:45 am·6-min read,14,June,2024,03:45:00,6,"Now that Nigel Farage has taken over as the leader of Reform UK, Richard Tice’s public profile is fading fast - but the Reform chairman remains involved in the party's operations.So far, the party has only one MP, Conservative defector Lee Anderson. But a recent poll has shown Reform overtaking the Tories, raising the possibility Anderson could hold his seat and even end up with fellow Reformers in the next Parliament.As the candidate for Hartlepool, where he stood as the Brexit Party candidate in 2019, Tice hopes to be one of them. So who is he, and what does he stand for?Childhood and educationBorn in Surrey in 1964 to James Tice, a showjumper, and Joan Tice, a horse trainer. Educated at the private boarding school Uppingham, he studied at the University of Salford, gaining a degree in construction economics and quantity surveying – teeing him up for a career that he said would ""continue the family genes in the property industry"".Family (partner & kids)Tice has three children from a 24-year marriage that ended in divorce. He is now in a long-term relationship with the right-wing writer and journalist Isabel Oakeshott.She is perhaps best known for two notorious incidents that set her against leading Tories: a book that featured the heavily disputed allegation that David Cameron had engaged in sexual activity with a pig, and the release of embarrassing messages entrusted to her by Matt Hancock when she agreed to write a book with him.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election? Full list mappedThe key issues that will decide the electionWhen is the first UK general election TV debate?What is purdah? The strict rule that governs what politicians can and can't sayNet worthWhile not quite in the same league as Rishi Sunak, Tice is one of the wealthiest people in British politics. As he describes it on his website, he made his multi-million-pound fortune over the course of “30 years of making things happen in property investment”, starting with a graduate job at a London firm in 1987.According to Tice, the company he leads as CEO, Quidnet Capital, has “bought and managed £500 million in commercial properties across the UK on behalf of clients”.He was also a key figure in the redevelopment of London’s Nine Elms district, near Battersea Power Station, a controversial project that has transformed a stretch of the Thames’s south bank with a welter of rapidly erected high-rise blocks.GB News linksAlong with Nigel Farage, Lee Anderson and several MPs on the right flank of the Tory party, Tice is a regular on the hard-right, culture war-focused TV outlet GB News. There he hosts a programme called “Richard Tice’s Sunday Sermon”, which serves as a platform for him to deliver his political analysis without the interruptions of an interviewer.However, despite the network being a relatively safe space for him in ideological terms, Tice’s appearances aren’t always amicable. A recent interview with host Andrew Pierce, a longtime right-wing commentator, saw him challenged fiercely about Reform’s chances in a summer election should one be called – with Pierce pointing to the “weirdos” selected by the party to fight numerous seats as evidence the party is “not ready”.Richard Tice, pictured in 2018 at a 'Leave Means Leave' campaign event, is focused on the issue of immigration. (Steve Finn/WENN)Tice was also involved in an incident that saw the network deemed in breach of broadcasting regulator Ofcom’s impartiality regulations, specifically an interview in which a former Brexit Party MEP failed to “sufficiently challenge” his views on immigration.The regulator is under increasing pressure to crack down on GB News heading into the election, with critics arguing it cannot be allowed to broadcast shows that feature Tory and Reform MPs interviewing each other without alternative points of view represented.Tice on NHSThe state and future of the NHS set to be one of this election’s main battlegrounds, and Reform’s key health policy is to spend £17 billion on the NHS on top of its current budget in an effort to get waiting lists down to zero. It also proposes introducing tax relief on private healthcare – something that has been criticised by opponents as a creeping step towards the privatisation of healthcare writ large.Tice’s stated rationale is that the reason the service is struggling is because the money it needs is being spent on other things that the public do not in fact support. Top of the list is Net Zero, which the party and its predecessors have long decried as a pointless “woke” project.In April, Tice used a press conference to frame the choice starkly. “We have a choice in this country, it seems to me,” he said. “A pretty clear choice. Do we want zero waiting lists in two years, and to keep them there? That is the Reform choice. Or do we want net zero CO2 emissions in 25 years? That is the Labour choice.”Tice on immigrationImmigration is by far Reform UK’s top issue, with the party looking to build on Farage’s two decades of campaigning against it in its legal and illegal forms.As far as the election goes, Tice and the party are targeting the continuing arrival of small boats of people travelling across the English Channel, many of them seeking asylum. He has criticised the government for failing to stop “mass immigration” post-Brexit, and described Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda policy as “a disaster”, arguing on GB News that its supposed deterrent value was revealed to be zero just hours after the House of Commons finally passed the law.Reform chairman Richard Tice (L) and leader Nigel Farage speak at the party's economic policy launch at Church House in London. (Alamy Live News)“Within a matter of hours more boats, absolutely packed full, overfilled with illegal migrants, were setting off from the beaches. And we learnt on Tuesday morning that sadly five people, including a young child, drowned leaving the beaches. That's not a deterrent. That's an absolute disaster.”Instead of deporting people to Rwanda, he is arguing for a “pick up and take back” policy that would see small boat arrivals deposited back on French soil. As evidence that this is both practical and humane, he has cited similar policies deployed in the US and Australia.However, he has not addressed the fact that Australia’s policy has been criticised internationally for leaving so-called “boat people” confined to facilities on the island of Nauru, where there have been incidents of suicide and self-immolation.Tice on cost of living crisisPerhaps unsurprisingly given he is trying to peel away former Tory voters, Tice has criticised recent Tory prime ministers harshly for overseeing Britain’s intense cost of living crisis. In 2022, he accused then-prime minister Boris Johnson of “waffling” over the situation. “Clueless, out of touch, no ideas, no help,” he tweeted. “Shocking.”He has also warned that the prospect of a “disastrous” Labour government will offer no prospect of meaningful relief for struggling households.Instead, Reform proposes lifting the minimum level of income tax to £20,000 while cutting various other taxes – among them fuel duty, another gesture to the party’s rejection of environmentalism as a top priority."

The party said this would amount to a total tax cut of £1,350 for the average worker on £35,000.It also reiterated its “long-term ambition” to scrap the “double tax on work” entirely when financial conditions allow.The manifesto also includes a pledge to abolish Stamp Duty on homes worth up to £425,000 for first-time buyers and to reintroduce the Help to Buy scheme.EconomyVow not to raise corporation taxEase burden of business rates for high street, leisure and hospitality firmsKeep the VAT threshold “under review”Return the size of the Civil Service to pre-pandemic levels to cut “government bureaucracy”Funnel civil service savings into defenceThe Tories said the “only way to give people peace of mind” that the UK can weather further global shocks is to “get borrowing and debt down”.Therefore, in the next Parliament, the party pledged to continue to meet its fiscal rules of having public sector net debt falling, and for public sector net borrowing to be below 3 per cent of GDP in the fifth year of the forecast.It said the measures in the manifesto are “fully funded” and “would result in lower borrowing in 2029-30”.The Conservatives promised to “always be the party of business”, with a vow not to raise corporation tax. They would also “continue to ease the burden of business rates” for high street, leisure and hospitality firms and keep the VAT threshold “under review”.Read the full 2024 Liberal Democrat manifesto hereMeanwhile, the party pledged to cut “government bureaucracy” by returning the size of the Civil Service to pre-pandemic levels, with the savings funnelled into defence spending.EnvironmentWater bosses to lose bonuses if their firm commits serious criminal breachInvest water company fines in river restoration projectsMore affordable housing for local people in rural areasEmpower councils to manage the growth of holiday letsExpand the UK’s Blue Belt marine conservation schemeNo new restrictions on fox huntingTo combat the sewage crisis blighting Britain’s waterways, the Tories would work with the regulator, Ofwat, to hold companies to account, including banning bonuses for bosses if their firm has committed a serious criminal breach. Proceeds from water companies fines would be used to invest in river restoration projects.The party would cut red tape that “holds back the planting of trees in the planning system”, identifying suitable areas where permits can be streamlined.It would maintain its “record flooding funding” of £5.6 billion over 2021-2027 and champion rural communities by backing farmers with a new legal target for food security.And it would “always stand up for farmers when negotiating new trade deals”.Rishi Sunak greets members of a synagogue in Golders Green, London, on June 30 - James ManningThe Conservatives would boost the availability of affordable housing for local people in rural areas, while ensuring councils have the powers they need to manage “the uncontrolled growth of holiday lets”.Mr Sunak has also vowed not to introduce any new restrictions on fox hunting after Labour said it would ban all forms of hunting with hounds if he wins.He promised not to make any changes to the Hunting Act introduced by Sir Tony Blair in 2004, in a pitch to traditional Tory heartlands.Read the full 2024 Labour manifesto hereThe Tories would consult UK overseas territories on further expanding the Blue Belt programme, the UK’s flagship marine conservation scheme.And the party remains committed to banning the import of hunting trophies and tackling puppy smuggling and livestock worrying.Energy and net zeroCut consumers’ costs by taking a “more pragmatic approach” to the transitionLower green levies on household billsPut forward a vote in Parliament for any new net zero targetNo new green levies or frequent flyer chargeNorth Sea licensing rounds to continue annuallyTreble Britain’s offshore wind capacity and support solar energy “in the right places”The Tories’ central pledge on net zero is to cut the cost for consumers by taking a “more pragmatic approach” to the transition, with green levies on household bills lower in each year of the next Parliament than they were in 2023.The “next stage” of the roadmap would be put to a vote in Parliament, with any new target subject to “proper consideration of the plans and policies required”, in order to “maintain democratic consent for the big decisions that net zero will mean for our country”.The party would reform the Climate Change Committee, giving it an “explicit mandate to consider cost to households and UK energy security” in its future advice.It also ruled out creating any new green levies or a frequent flyer charge.North Sea licensing rounds would continue on an annual basis, in contrast to Labour’s policy. Meanwhile, the Tories would aim to treble Britain’s offshore wind capacity and support solar “in the right places” - crucially “not on our best agricultural land”.It also pledges to look at burying pylons underground and guaranteeing a parliamentary vote on the next stages of the “pathway” of net zero.Education and childcareBan mobile phones during the school dayEnsure parents see what their children are being taught in schoolsTransform post-16 education with new “Advanced British Standard”Create 100,000 apprenticeships by 2029New teachers in priority areas to get bonuses of up to £30k tax-free over five yearsThe Tories would ban mobile phones during the school day and ensure parents can see what their children are being taught, especially on “sensitive matters like sex education”.The party would aim to “transform” post-16 education by introducing a new Advanced British Standard, bringing together academic A-levels and technical T-levels.It has also pledged to create a further 100,000 apprenticeships by 2029, paid for by scrapping “poor quality” degrees.Both primary and secondary schools would be required to deliver two hours of PE every week. To boost recruitment, new teachers in priority areas and sought-after subjects would receive bonuses of up to £30,000 tax-free over five years from September 2024.The Prime Minister’s flagship campaign promise to bring back national service also features in the manifesto.Under the mandatory scheme, 18-year-olds would have to enrol in the military for a year or spend one weekend each month volunteering in their community.DefenceBring back national service for school leaversIncrease military budget to 2.5 per cent of GDP by end of the decade£3 billion in support every year for Ukraine until 2030Introduce a Veterans’ Bill that gives employers tax breaks for hiring themIn his first major policy announcement of the election campaign, Mr Sunak vowed to bring back national service for school leavers, which would open military placements to 30,000 youngsters with residential stays at army barracks or other military facilities.The Conservatives hope the policy will set them apart from Labour as they seek to present themselves as the only party that can be trusted with the UK’s security and defence with multiple threats facing Britain and the world.Mr Sunak warned in a speech in May that a Labour victory represented a threat to UK security.The Prime Minister announced his party would hike the military budget to 2.5 per cent of GDP by the end of the decade - a commitment Labour has failed to match.He also committed to at least £3 billion in support every year for Ukraine until 2030, with both pledges reinforced in the election manifesto.In a major speech at the Policy Exchange think tank on May 13, Mr Sunak argued that Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, would be emboldened by Labour not matching his promise to raise defence spending to 2.5 per cent by 2030.It comes with concerns having been raised about the size of the Army, Navy and Air Force and their struggle to attract enough new recruits.In a tribute to Armed Forces personnel, Mr Sunak will also introduce a Veterans’ Bill to give employers tax breaks for hiring “heroes who have put their lives on the line” and cut the price of rail travel for them.Elsewhere, the Tories pledged to declare China a risk to UK security on a par with Russia and Iran if they win the election.They have committed to adding China to the “enhanced tier” of the UK’s foreign influence registration scheme, meaning all Chinese individuals acting on behalf of the nation would face heightened scrutiny.Pensions and welfare“Quadruple lock” state pension that will never be taxedKeep winter fuel payments, free TV licences and bus passes for pensionersCrackdown on Britain’s welfare billOverhaul sick notes to get more people back into workTougher sanctions for those able to seek work but choose not toMr Sunak declared on May 27 that the state pension will never be taxed under the Conservatives as he unveiled a so-called quadruple lock.The manifesto also promises to keep all other pensioner perks including winter fuel payments, free TV licences and bus passes in place.It adds: “We are carefully considering the Ombudsman report into WASPI women and will work with Parliament to provide an appropriate and swift response.”At the same time it takes a completely different approach when it comes to benefits, with a crackdown on Britain’s ballooning welfare bill set out.The manifesto includes an overhaul of sick notes to get more people back into work and tougher sanctions for those who are able to seek work but choose not to.Policing and crimeTougher sentencing for knife crimeBuild four new jails by 2030, providing 20,000 extra prison placesRecruit an extra 8,000 police officersNew mandatory 25-year sentences for domestic abuse murdersNew police powers to ban protests that pose a risk of serious disorderBan protests outside schoolsThe election campaign has seen Mr Sunak and Sir Keir battle it out for who can sound the toughest when it comes to cracking down on crime.Labour has banged the drum on lower-level offences like burglary and antisocial behaviour, painting a picture of a lawless Britain where neighbourhoods live in fear.The Prime Minister has come under pressure to match that rhetoric with harsher sentences for petty criminals and more community payback schemes.His manifesto includes a crackdown on knife crime with tougher sentencing, allowing the Tories to target Sadiq Khan’s record in London.The Tories also pledge to build four new jails by 2030, providing 20,000 extra prison places so that more criminals can be locked up for longer.The dossier also includes a commitment to recruit an extra 8,000 police officers dedicated specifically to tackling neighbourhood crime in a £650 million plan that would take the total number of officers in the UK to its highest level ever at 180,000.And it states that the Tories will “toughen up community sentencing by increasing the use of community payback and electronic tagging, so criminals pay their debt to society and communities witness justice being served”.Elsewhere it contains new mandatory 25-year sentences for domestic abuse murders and commits to a wider review of homicide sentencing which could lead to the creation of US-style first and second-degree murder, increasing the minimum sentence for murders in the home from 15 to 25 years.Find out how Reform UK’s full manifesto comparesThe manifesto also says police will get new powers to ban protests or marches that pose a risk of serious disorder. Chief constables would be able to block marches due to the “cumulative” disruption and “persistent” threats to public order. Police could also be able to recover the costs of policing protests from groups that organised them.Protests outside schools would also be banned to “stop mobs from intimidating teachers and children”. Teachers would be given legal protection from blasphemy accusations following cases such as the Batley school cartoon row where a teacher was forced into hiding.Police and prosecutors would be placed under a new legal duty to publish regular guidance on the statements, chants or symbols, such as the swastika or the term “jihad”, that in the context of political protest may constitute an offence.MigrationBring in a “binding, legal” annual cap on immigrationAnnual vote in Parliament on the visa cap figureLegal migrants must undergo a health check before getting a visaRaise skilled workers’ salary requirements in line with inflation each yearRemove illegal migrants to Rwanda, with monthly flights, starting in July, until the boats are stoppedSign further returns deals similar to the agreement with AlbaniaMr Sunak has been under huge pressure from his own MPs to go into the election on a cast-iron promise to dramatically cut net migration.The manifesto includes a commitment to bring in a “binding, legal” annual cap on immigration visas but does not say at what number it would be set.Instead Parliament would get an annual vote on the visa cap figure, which would be recommended by the Government’s migration advisers.Legal migrants would be required to undergo a health check before getting a visa as part of a plan to reduce the cost to the NHS of those arriving with conditions.The manifesto also includes a commitment to raise the salary requirements for skilled workers in line with inflation every year “to make sure they don’t undercut UK workers”.On stopping the small boats, it says: “We will run a relentless, continual process of permanently removing illegal migrants to Rwanda with a regular rhythm of flights every month, starting this July, until the boats are stopped.”The manifesto also commits the Government to “sign further returns deals like the one we have already agreed with Albania”.It also says the party will work with other countries to “rewrite” asylum treaties to make them fit for the “challenges” of illegal migration.But it stops short of pledging a referendum on leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, as demanded by some Tory MPs.Instead it only opens the door to the possibility of leaving the convention by vowing to put the security of UK borders ahead of membership of a foreign court.Levelling-upGive 30 towns across UK £20 million eachCreate more freeports and continue backing investment zonesRevitalise high streets by changing planning lawsMake chewing gum manufacturers pay for street cleaningMr Sunak has pledged to give 30 towns across the UK £20 million each in an expansion of the party’s levelling-up policy.The Prime Minister claimed that the methodology used to select the towns – including Tamworth, Bognor Regis, Flint, Perth and Newry – had been used “multiple times before” based on “levelling-up needs, looking at economic opportunity, skills, health and life expectancy”.He claimed towns were “neglected” under a previous Labour government and added: “I’m not going to make any apology for supporting towns.“Crucially, it will be local people in all those areas that are in charge of how to spend that money, to make sure it’s spent and invested on their priorities - an example of us levelling up everywhere, backing local people and their priorities, and giving them the long-term funding and assurance to do so,” he said.The manifesto also includes pledges to create more freeports, where businesses get tax breaks for investing, and to continue backing investment zones.Elsewhere it features a commitment to revitalise high streets by changing planning laws and making chewing gum manufacturers pay for street cleaning.“We will change planning laws to support places to bring back local market days and regenerate defunct shopping centres,” it says."
