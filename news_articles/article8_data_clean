The Guardian,Tory candidate accused of dog-whistle tactics against rival with Indian name,[],Aletha Adu,18 June 2024 at 0:06 pm·3-min read,18,June,2024,00:06:00,3,"A Conservative candidate has been criticised for sending letters to British-Pakistani voters allegedly insinuating they should vote for him instead of his Labour rival because of her Indian surname.Marco Longhi, the Tory candidate fighting for re-election in Dudley North against Sonia Kumar, has been accused of using dog-whistle politics and attempting to “alienate British Hindus”.In a letter to “voters of the British Pakistani/Kashmiri community in Dudley”, Longhi asked if the Labour candidate would speak for Kashmir in parliament. Kumar’s name was in bold, capitalised and underlined.Rishi Sunak has been called to withdraw his support for Longhi and condemn the letter.Related: Harold, Denise, Alison and Mark: Tories’ hypothetical target voters are all white, document revealsAnneliese Dodds, the chair of the Labour party, said: “This is clearly inappropriate, divisive, dog-whistle politics from the Conservatives. There is no place for such behaviour anywhere in our political system.“Rishi Sunak needs to take action immediately. If he fails to do so, it will show his promise of professionalism and accountability to be a hollow sham.”Kumar is a common Indian surname, with Hindu origins. As of 2014, 97% of all known holders of the surname were residents of India.There is no written record in Hansard of Longhi having brought up Kashmir in the chamber since he became an MP in 2019.Dodd’s comments were echoed by Labour’s candidate for Leicester East, Rajesh Agrawal, who classed the letter as a “shameful attempt to divide the area that Mr Longhi claims to represent”. Agrawal said it was “offensive to both Muslim and Hindu communities”.“There should be zero tolerance of the dog-whistle politics Mr Longhi is engaged in. Rishi Sunak should immediately remove Conservative party support for Mr Longhi’s campaign and apologise for attempting to alienate British Hindus,” he added.defaultKrish Raval, chair of Labour’s group for Indians, also criticised the letter, and the prime minister for failing to call out the divisive politics.“We find Marco Longhi’s comments racist, dangerous and wholly divisive,” Raval said, adding: “It is also disheartening to see an Indian-origin leader of the Conservatives let anti-Indian racism run rife through his party.”Sunder Katwala, director of the British Future thinktank, said: “Different parties, and candidates, have in past got into trouble making pitches to voters of one ethnicity/faith background that could harm the party if seen by voters of another background. It should not happen – especially in such brazen prejudiced form.“Obviously, any representative in parliament ought to be able to represent constituents of different ethnic and faith backgrounds. In my view any of the major parties should suspend a candidate for doing this.”Longhi later doubled down on his letter, telling GB News: “This is politics, isn’t it? Do you want someone who has consistently been supportive of Kashmiris where there have been human rights abuses or do you want someone called Sonia Kumar who no one has ever heard of?”The Guardian has contacted Longhi for comment."

The Guardian,"Johnson and Sunak should retain Covid convictions, says Starmer",[],Jessica Elgot,19 June 2024 at 7:14 am·2-min read,19,June,2024,07:14:00,2,"Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak should not have their convictions removed for breaking Covid rules, Keir Starmer has said, amid calls from Conservative former cabinet ministers to nullify criminal convictions for Covid rule-breakers.Starmer said they should not have their convictions removed, though ex-ministers have made the case that 28,000 people who were given the convictions should have their slates wiped clean.The Labour leader said it was wrong for that to apply to the then prime minister and chancellor, who were fined amid the Partygate investigation when they attended a birthday gathering for Johnson.Starmer said: “Seriously, they want Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak’s convictions to be removed? Some great amnesty? Come on.“Many, many people paid a very high price in that pandemic. They don’t understand how deep that goes. The now prime minister and his predecessor but one are convicted of breaking the rules that they put in place and if they don’t understand how deep that goes it just reinforces how out of touch they are.”Related: Civil war, what civil war? The so-called Tory moderates never even put up a fight | Rafael BehrRobert Buckland, who was justice secretary during the pandemic, said it was unfair the convictions could bar people from jobs such as teaching, social work or police roles, especially given how young many offenders were.Guardian research last year found there had been more than 28,000 convictions for Covid-related offences, such as attendance at gatherings during lockdowns or arriving at airports without the proper evidence of a coronavirus test. Almost 16,000 of the convictions – or 55% – involved people under 30.Buckland told the Telegraph it was “not proportionate or necessary at a time when we want to encourage and support as many people back to work as possible”, adding: “I would wipe the slate clean.”David Davis, another former cabinet minister, told the newspaper he believed also there should be an amnesty. “Much of the Covid regulation was heavy-handed, unnecessary and penalised people wrongly. For this to turn into a lifetime penalty is a shameful disgrace and we should correct it as soon as possible.”The average fine issued in magistrates courts in 2022 was £6,000, although some people have been fined as much as £10,000.Nearly 125,000 fixed-penalty notices were issued in England and Wales during the pandemic, ranging from £50, such as that received by Johnson for attending a party with 30 people while he was prime minister, to fines of £10,000 given to others for similar offences.

The Guardian,Rishi Sunak says Tories will not give Frank Hester his money back,[],Aletha Adu and Henry Dyer,19 June 2024 at 7:43 am·3-min read,19,June,2024,07:43:00,3,"Rishi Sunak has said he will not hand back money from the Conservative party’s biggest donor, who said Diane Abbott should be shot, because the businessman is “genuinely contrite”.A caller during an LBC phone-in asked the prime minister about Frank Hester’s remarks about the Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP.The Guardian revealed Hester had said during a meeting in 2019 that Abbott made him want to “hate all black women” and that she “should be shot”. After the report, Abbott made a complaint to the Metropolitan police.Hester, who has given more than £15m to the Tories directly or through his company, is also alleged to have referred to a staff member as the “token Muslim”, imitated people of Chinese descent and remarked that one individual was attractive for a black woman, according to former employees who spoke to the Guardian.Hester apologised for the Abbott comments, which were widely condemned as racist and misogynistic, but did not respond to requests to comment on other claims.On Wednesday, an LBC caller told the prime minister: “Just saying he’s apologised isn’t going to cut it.”Sunak appeared to insinuate that there was an equivalence between Hester and some remarks Abbott has made, as he said Abbott herself had made “some comments in the past that were not appropriate but she apologised for those and was readmitted back into the Labour party”.“Maybe we disagree on this, but I believe if people are genuinely contrite … that should be accepted,” Sunak told the caller.“I do think that in life if you made a mistake and honestly apologised and learned from it, as a society if that is something we can come together on, [that] is important.”The accusations against Hester had piled pressure on Sunak after it was confirmed that the donor had given a further £5m to the Tories through his healthcare tech company, the Phoenix Partnership (TPP). It brings the total donated by Hester to more than £15m in a year.This equates to more than 40% of the total national spending limit for each party in the general election.Sunak is yet to comment on the latest allegations of comments made by Hester about race or religion in the workplace or on work trips.After the Guardian reported details of claims by former employees about his workplace behaviour, Sunak was asked by a reporter while on a campaign visit in Wiltshire earlier this month if Hester should apologise for the latest alleged remarks. He declined to comment.A Conservative spokesperson said Hester had “rightly apologised for comments made in the past”. Hester issued an apology for “rude” remarks about Abbott, denying they were motivated by race or gender, and saying he “abhorred racism”. All of the latest allegations were put to Hester. He did not respond to the claims.After Sunak skipped a key part of the D-day commemorations, the Liberal Democrats urged him to donate money Hester had given them to a veterans’ charity.Ed Davey said Sunak’s snub of a key international D-day event was “a letdown for our whole country”.On a campaign visit to Victoria Park in Newbury, Berkshire, the Lib Dem leader told broadcasters: “I’ve felt pretty cross about this. I’ve talked to veterans and they feel quite angry. So, I think they need to do more.“I think the Conservative party should give £5m of that donation to a veterans’ charity. I think if they did that, then people might be able to draw the line.”"

The Independent,Rachel Reeves and Keir Starmer clash over whether working people have savings after Labour tax pledge,[],Alex Ross,19 June 2024 at 6:53 am·2-min read,19,June,2024,06:53:00,2,"Rachel Reeves has clarified Sir Keir Starmer’s definition of “working people” days after the party pledged not to raise taxes on workers if it got into power.The shadow chancellor backed up the promise in the party’s manifesto in a video message where she said she would not put up income tax, National Insurance or VAT.But after Sir Keir appeared to omit pensioners and savers when asked for his definition of “working people”, senior Tories claimed it indicated the party actually intended to raise taxes.Asked what he meant by “working people” in a radio interview on LBC on Tuesday, Sir Keir said: “People who earn their living, rely on our [public] services and don’t really have the ability to write a cheque when they get into trouble” he said.“So the sort of people I’m meeting pretty well every day now. It’s quite a big group because these days there are many people obviously not so well off.”Rachel Reeves told Kay Burley that ‘working people’ didn’t mean people without savings (Sky News)But on Wednesday, Ms Reeves appeared to distance herself from her leader’s definition when asked on both Sky News and BBC Radio 4.Ms Reeves told the Today programme: “Working people are people who get their income from going out to work every day, and also pensioners that have worked all their lives and are now in retirement, drawing down on their pensions.”She added: “Many working people do have savings, but the truth is, during the cost-of-living crisis, loads of working people have had to run down those savings and have very little left, very little to draw upon.”And speaking to Kay Burley, who put Sir Keir’s definition to her several times, Ms Reeves said: “Some people who go out to work haven’t been able to build up savings, many other people who go to work have had to run down their savings.“But there are many people who do have savings and have been able to save up and those are working people as well.”Following Sir Keir’s interview on LBC, Jeremy Hunt told The Telegraph Sir Keir had “let slip Labour’s true plans” to raise taxes across the board.“Under pressure, Starmer has finally made it clear that Labour would raise taxes on millions of hardworking people who they don’t deem to meet their narrow and misguided definition of ‘working’,” he said.On the announcement of a drop in inflation to the target 2 per cent, Ms Reeves also told Sky News she welcomed the news, but added the cost-of-living crisis was not over and that the prices faces by many families were still not falling.Prime minister Rishi Sunak said the inflation fall from 2.3 per cent in April to 2 per cent in May showed the economy had “turned a corner”."
The National,In full: John Swinney's SNP election manifesto launch speech,"[""John Swinney's full election manifesto launch speech""]",Gregor Young,19 June 2024 at 5:56 am·10-min read,19,June,2024,05:56:00,10,"JOHN Swinney has launched the SNP's General Election manifesto with a pledge to ""deliver independence"" and put ""the interests of the people of Scotland first"".With just a few weeks to go until voters head to the polls, Swinney has laid out his party's priorities in his first manifesto launch since becoming First Minister. You can read the full speech delivered in Edinburgh this morning below.John Swinney's full election manifesto launch speechGood morning – and welcome to the launch of the SNP manifesto for the 2024 Westminster election.This election takes place at a time when people are hurting.The aftermath of Covid has left scars amongst our people.The cost of living crisis has meant people are worried about their future and the wellbeing of their loved ones.We are living in a period of rapid change where new technology, the climate emergency and the implications of an ageing population will all have a profound impact on the way we live our lives in the future.Given this atmosphere of turmoil, more than ever I believe political leaders and political parties need a set of values as a foundation from which to respond to those challenges.I believe people are crying out for principled leadership which is prepared to argue for what it believes in.So today, as I launch the SNP manifesto for the 2024 General Election, let me set out the core values of the Scottish National Party that anchor our proposition to the people of Scotland.We are a moderate left of centre party in the mainstream of Scottish public opinion, firmly rooted in the ideas of inclusion and internationalism.We will always put the interests of people in Scotland first – wherever our people were born; wherever our people come from.And at the very heart of our beliefs is the principle that decisions about Scotland should be made by the people who live in Scotland.Why? For the simple reason that no-one else cares as much about this wonderful country, and no-one else will do a better job of taking care of it, now and in the future, than the people who live here.It is through independence therefore that we believe we can build the fairer country and the more prosperous economy we know is possible.Not independence for its own sake.Independence for the powers to protect our NHS and to help people through tough times.Independence for a stronger economy, and happier, healthier lives.And independence for a better future for Scotland – made in Scotland – for Scotland.It is those values that govern our overall approach and the content of this manifesto.So let me outline the choice the SNP offers to the people of Scotland at this election.First and foremost, we are the only major party arguing for an end to the spending cuts.The arbitrary Tory fiscal rules, adopted by Labour, bake-in more eye-watering cuts.18 billion pounds of cuts.The SNP manifesto argues for new, sensible fiscal rules. Rules that will: end the cuts, reverse the 1.3 billion pounds cut to Scotland’s capital budget, and invest in public services, starting with the Health Service.We will join with progressive politicians south of the border to press for greater funding for the NHS and for the UK government to match the pay deals we have given our health staff in Scotland.That would see an extra £1.6 billion for the NHS in Scotland.And we would introduce a “Keep the NHS in Public Hands Bill” at Westminster.A legal guarantee for a publicly owned, publicly operated health service.The SNP message on the health services is clear, it is simple and it will never change.The NHS is not for sale.Voting SNP is a vote to protect our public services and our precious NHS.Friends,I have made clear the focus of my Government will be to eradicate child poverty.The 2-child benefit cap makes things worse.It is the exact opposite of what the UK government should be doing.Introduced by an uncaring Conservative Government, it is frankly beyond me that the prospective Labour Government plan, to keep this deeply damaging policy.SNP MPs will press for the 2-child benefit cap to be scrapped.Colleagues, the future of the 2 child cap is a simple test.Are you in government to help children out of poverty?Or are you so morally lost, that you push more kids into poverty?Our choice – to abolish the cap – is obvious and it is driven by our values.The same values that drive the SNP on so many issues, not least nuclear weapons.We will demand an end to the obscene waste of billions of pounds on a new generation of weapons of mass destruction.And, while we are talking about waste, SNP MPs will demand that the House of Lords is abolished.Our values, Scotland’s choices.Elected government not ermine clad cronies.Lift the 2-child cap not the cap on bankers’ bonuses.Bairns not bombs.And, investment not cuts.I believe these choices represent the values most of us share.They are Scotland’s values.And a vote for the SNP – a vote for this manifesto – is a vote for those values.Friends, every election is a choice.Over recent years, the outrageous Westminster power grab has been designed to reduce the choices Scotland can make for itself.That must stop.The devolution-busting Internal Market Act must be revoked.Westminster routinely passing laws in devolved areas without the consent of the Scottish Parliament must end.For Scotland’s workers we will support the end of exploitative zero hours contracts, the unacceptable practice of fire and rehire, and we will fight to scrap the so-called Minimum Services Level Act which is an attack on the right to strike.Fighting against Westminster austerity cuts, for our NHS, for better working conditions and against the Westminster power grab.Working whenever we can with others to promote practical, moderate left of centre policies – that is what we are offering the people of Scotland at this election.The SNP will stand up for Scotland at Westminster, and put Scotland’s interests first.But we know the Westminster system is broken – no matter how much we try to mitigate its impact.I think most people in Scotland know that.So our ambition is to transfer power from Westminster and into the hands of the people of Scotland.Taking decisions in Scotland, for Scotland works.Using the limited powers of the Scottish Parliament has had a real impact on people’s lives.The SNP has introduced a more progressive tax system to help fund the NHS and other public services.We’ve delivered the best performing core A and E services in the UK for nearly 10 years.We’re helping with the cost of living through free prescriptions, all day off-peak rail travel and free bus travel for young people.We’ve overseen a massive expansion in renewable energy and are already half way towards net zero.We’ve delivered many more affordable houses, per head of population, than England or Wales.I know, however, that we must constantly strive to strengthen our work in transforming the lives of people of Scotland.Through measures such as the Scottish Child Payment we’re keeping an estimated 100,000 children out of poverty.That is the SNP in government at Holyrood – working day in, day out to earn and re-earn the trust of people in Scotland.We will not always get everything right but we will always put the interests of Scotland first.The UK is going in a different direction – the wrong direction.Far too often the interests of Scotland are ignored altogether.I’ve spoken a lot in this campaign about the A B and C of Westminster imposed austerity cuts, Brexit and the cost of living crisis.Scotland wanted none of that.But they were imposed anyway.So today I want to introduce a D to that list: democracy.With independence, people in Scotland will always get the governments they vote for.That’s how democracy should work: engaging in respectful persuasion, taking account of everyone’s view, working together wherever possible in the national interest,And it is through the power of democracy that we will win our independence.There is no other way.We must never lose faith in the power of the democratic voice of the people of Scotland.In 2021 they voted for a Scottish Parliament with a clear majority for independence and for a referendum.That democratic choice must be respected.At this election we have the opportunity to reinforce the case for Scotland becoming an independent country.It is the substance of the case that will take us there.That starts with the economy.Scotland has resources and talent in abundance.We have extraordinary energy resources.A world-class food and drink sector.An incredible tourism offering.Brilliant universities.Thriving financial services and creative industries.And we are the forefront of the industries of the future such as offshore wind power.Since coming to office the SNP has grown both productivity and the Scottish economy faster per head than the UK.But most economic powers lie with Westminster.And the UK economy is failing far too many people.In an independent Scotland we could be back in the EU – for the first time as an equal member in our own right.We would be part of the huge Single Market, which by population is seven times the size of the UK.We would enjoy once again the benefits of European freedom of movement – vital for so many Scottish businesses.Our young people would have the opportunity again to study and work freely across Europe.And in turn we would welcome our fellow Europeans to Scotland.The SNP has funded one of Europe’s finest programmes dedicated to the creation of high growth businesses.With a potential market of 450 million people in the Single Market, think of the massive opportunity for further growth.Of course, an independent Scotland, like all countries would face challenges.Success would not be guaranteed.That would be determined by our own decisions as a country and the choice we make.But when we look at independent European countries similar to Scotland there are grounds for optimism and hope.Countries like Denmark, Ireland and Sweden are wealthier per head than the UK.They are fairer with lower inequality.They have higher productivity – the key driver of living standards.And they have lower poverty.So with all our resources; all our talent, with everything we have to offer and all our ambition – why not Scotland?In an independent Scotland people would have a constitutional right to access a system of health care free at the point of need.The threat of creeping Westminster privatisation would be over for good.Staffing in our health and care services would not be subject to a hostile Westminster migration policy.And our public services would not be subject to disastrous Westminster austerity policies.So never let anyone tell you that independence is separate from people’s daily concerns.It is fundamental to those concerns.It is about where decisions about Scotland are made.Decisions over our economy.Our health service.Our living standards.So on July the 4th I am asking you to vote SNP.I’m asking you to vote SNP to put the interests of people in Scotland first.I’m asking you to vote SNP for a future made in Scotland - for Scotland.Thank you."

South Wales Argus,David Davies' election signs are disappearing from the Monmouthshire countryside,[],Twm Owen,19 June 2024 at 6:00 am·2-min read,19,June,2024,06:00:00,2,"ELECTION signs promoting Welsh secretary David Davies are disappearing from sites across his home county.Conservative supporters have reported signs being removed or vandalised from locations as far apart as Trellech, near Monmouth, and Usk more than 10 miles away by road.Monmouthshire is one of the key battleground seats in Wales at the general election and is being heavily targeted by Labour despite Mr Davies having a majority 9,982 from 2019 when it was fought on different boundaries which didn’t include areas such as Caldicot in the south west of the county.Mr Davies, who was first elected to Parliament in 2005 when he took the Monmouth seat from Labour, claimed the removal of the signs was anti-democratic.He said: “This is completely unacceptable behaviour and cannot be tolerated in a democratic society.“My principles and values are shared by thousands of people across the whole of Monmouthshire.“The opposition parties won’t want to hear it. But I will continue to stand up to the Labour Welsh Government.”The same field, near Trellech, with only the sign posts remaining. (Image: supplied)Mr Davies highlighted his opposition to the default 20 mile per hour speed limit in residential areas in Wales, which the Conservatives have claimed they would over rule the Senedd to overturn, funding for the NHS and the expansion of the Senedd as areas where he has challenged the Welsh Government.He added: “I will not be silenced. I will continue to stand up for the true interests of Monmouthshire.”Conservative Senedd Member for Monmouth, Peter Fox, said a field near Trellech, where posts have been left in the ground and posters promoting Mr Davies removed, has been used by the party for years.He said: “All of the posters were put up with the landowners’ permission we are always careful to obtain that.“Many of our posters are also asked for by the owners. The one pictured is a site we’ve used for many elections and the posters were erected by our campaign team.“This was the same for a run of five ripped down and removed at Llanlowell near Usk. Those particular ones have been replaced now. There are other examples around the county that already have been vandalised or removed.”READ MORE: Monmouthshire general election 2024 list of candidatesThere is no indication who is responsible for the removal or damage to any signs but a press release issued by Mr Davies warned “this is an illicit offence and classed as criminal damage, which could lead to prosecution”.Illicit means not allowed by law.Mr Fox said he hasn’t as yet reported the removal of the signs to the police."

I am concerned about the impact. I won’t shy away from that. But my message today is remember your ID when you go to vote this time around.”Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said he hopes his party’s campaign trail, which has seen him ride rollercoasters at Thorpe Park and build sandcastles in south Devon, will engage more people in politics.He told PA news agency: “In our campaign, yes we’ve got some serious messages, but because we’re doing it in an unusual way, instantly different… I hope it’s engaging people.“Something we’ve picked up from the doorstep is people actually like it, they feel that we’re not being stuffy and out-of-touch, we’re trying to engage.“Whether that’s going to drive voter registration I don’t know, but I hope people will register and will take part.”"
