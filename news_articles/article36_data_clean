Yahoo News UK,Who is Ed Davey? The Lib Dem leader whose life has been marked by adversity,"['His early life', 'His family', 'His parents', 'His education', 'Why is he a Sir?']",Hannah Fearn,Updated 1 July 2024 at 2:04 pm¬∑3-min read,1,July,2024,02:04:00,3,"The youngest of three boys, Sir Ed Davey had a childhood marked by adversity. His mother died when he was a teenager and his father died when he was just four.As an adult, Davey now cares for his son, who is disabled with a neurological condition.So what do we know about the man who leads the third party in British politics?His early lifeEd Davey was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on Christmas Day in 1965. He was the youngest of three boys, but lost his father at just four years old and then his mother when he was in his mid-teens. She had spent three years battling cancer, during which time he nursed his mother together with his grandmother and brother Henry.Once a keen Scout and Air Scout, he later remembers feeling ‚Äúisolated‚Äù at school because of his caring responsibilities, which meant he couldn‚Äôt take part in after-school activities or sports. ‚ÄúThe last 18 months she was bedridden and in a lot of pain. I‚Äôd spend hours on the bed, talking to her,‚Äù he said. Davey was with his mother when she died at Nottingham General Hospital, after being placed on an unsuited dementia ward.After both his parents had died, Davey was brought up by his maternal grandparents in the village of Eakring, though his grandfather died soon after. He spent much of his childhood and young adulthood close to his grandmother. ‚ÄúFirst of all, she was looking after me. Then we were looking after each other,‚Äù he said.His familyDavey married Emily Gasson, a former Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate who unsuccessfully stood in four elections and is now a councillor, in 2005 and the pair have two children, a son and daughter.Their son, John, born in 2007 and now a teenager, is disabled with a neurological condition. He has attended special schools but is now educated at home with a tutor ‚Äì a change that Davey said led to him becoming verbal for the first time. He has spoken about his anxiety about who will care for his son when he and his wife are no longer around. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the thing that worries me more than anything else in my life,‚Äù Davey said.Gasson was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in 2012. She was well for many years following her diagnosis, but declined during lockdown and is working on recovering her physical strength.His parentsEd Davey, pictured with his family. (Liberal Democrats)His father, John, was a solicitor and his mother, Nina, a teacher. Davey has described how he was inspired to study by his mother, who always wanted him to try hard academically and who he wanted to impress.His educationDavey attended the private Nottingham High School, the alma mater of former chancellor Kenneth Clarke. He became head boy, with Labour MP Ed Balls ‚Äì who was studying in the year below ‚Äì watching on.After school, he achieved a first class degree in philosophy, politics and economics at Jesus College, Oxford where he was junior common room president. After becoming an economics researcher for the Liberal Democrats he returned to study, reading for a master‚Äôs degree in economics at Birkbeck College, London.Ed Davey as Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change alongside the then leader of the Lib Dems, Nick Clegg, and Jo Swinson, pictured during the coalition government in 2015. (Getty)Why is he a Sir?For three years, the Lib Dem leader was a member of the cabinet in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition government, holding the post of secretary of state for energy and climate change from 2012 to 2015. He was knighted in the 2016 New Year‚Äôs Honours for ‚Äúpolitical and public services‚Äù."

Explaining why this is such a big deal in the world of political modelling, JLP says: ""The main advantage of this kind of stacking is that we can use different models to probe different parts of the data giving a more holistic set of predictions that consider many different facets of the data.""This includes models that are superior at unpicking the constituency level predictors whilst other models can investigate the individual level effects in much more detail.""Some models, like multilevel regression, can analyse both the individual level and constituency level data simultaneously. The combination of these models then produces estimates that more accurately represent the nuances in the underlying data.""Other noteworthy prediction in JLP's model, described as a ""super poll"" by the Times' chief political commentator Tim Shipman, is Reform UK winning two seats, with Nigel Farage predicted to win Clacton and Lee Anderson, who defected from the Tories in March, keeping hold of Ashfield.The Liberal Democrats are also tracked to regain their place as the third party of British politics, going from just 11 seats in the Commons to 55, while the Scottish National Party (SNP) are set to lose 33 seats, leaving only 15.The level of detail in JLP's model means the company has been able to put together a list of major Conservative MPs expected to lose their seats, including Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Grant Shapps, Mel Stride and Esther McVey.You can search for your constituency to find the projected winner and their margin of victory here. Reform UK snapping at Tories' heels as Labour takes dipYouGov's voting intention tracker currently predicts Labour to win 37% of the vote.Although it is still by far the highest scoring political party, it is a significant drop from the 47% recorded on 28 May ‚Äì six days after Sunak called a surprise snap general election.There is only a 2% margin between Reform UK and the Tories, according to YouGov, with the Conservative's projected to win 20% of the vote, compared to 18% for Nigel Farage's party.Labour vote share drops to 'lowest in over two years'In another sign that Labour's success has plateaued, a recent poll for the Telegraph suggests there is only a 17% gap between the Tories and Starmer's party.This would leave Labour with its lowest predicted vote share since January 2022, when Boris Johnson was still prime minister, according to pollsters Savanta.However, this is unlikely to worry Starmer, as the poll still puts Labour on track to win 38% of the vote and a majority of more than 260 seats.üö®NEW Westminster Voting Intention for Sunday @TelegraphüìàLowest Labour vote share since January 2022üåπLab 38 (-4)üå≥Con 21 (=)‚û°Ô∏èReform 14 (=)üî∂LD 11 (+1)üåçGreen 6 (+1)üéóÔ∏èSNP 2 (-1)‚¨úÔ∏èOther 7 (+1)2,092 UK adults26-28 June (chg from 21-24 June) pic.twitter.com/cdyp3lJygQ‚Äî Savanta UK (@Savanta_UK) June 29, 2024Chris Hopkins, the director of political research at Savanta, told the Telegraph: ‚ÄúThis is our lowest Labour vote share since Rishi Sunak became prime minister, and the Conservatives for their part do appear to have slowed or stopped their downward spiral.""He added that a rise in vote share for the Green Party and independent candidates will not have a significant impact on election day but could ""point towards trouble for the Labour Party in government and over the coming years"".What are the latest odds?As of 1 July, Oddschecker ‚Äì a website which compares odds across different bookmakers ‚Äì had Labour at 1/41 to win the most seats. To put that in context, this is seen as so likely that a ¬£10 bet would return just ¬£10.24.Bookies are putting the Conservatives at 125/1 to win the most seats, or to win a majority, with both scenarios so unlikely that a ¬£10 punt would return ¬£1,260.Reform UK has better chances, according to Oddschecker, with 80/1 odds of winning the most seats in the general election and 100/1 odds of having an overall majority.What went wrong for the Tories?So, why have the polls changed so dramatically? It's worth looking back on an extremely eventful four-and-a-half years in UK politics.According to YouGov's voting intention tracker (see chart above), Tory support peaked at 53%, with Labour on 32%, in April 2020, months after the party's stunning success in the 2019 general election and Boris Johnson's pledge to ‚Äúget Brexit done‚Äù. That month also saw Starmer take over as Labour leader from Jeremy Corbyn.This was also amid a spirit of national unity following the onset of the COVID pandemic which nearly killed Johnson himself. The then-PM had been released from hospital five days before this particular survey was taken.Boris Johnson delivers his final speech as prime minister outside 10 Downing Street in September 2022. (AFP via Getty Images)Over the rest of the year, there was a downturn in support amid chaos over COVID rules, with the Tories falling as low as 35% in November 2020, compared to Labour on 40%.However, the UK‚Äôs successful COVID vaccination programme provided a pathway out of lockdown and with it, improved poll ratings. Tory support peaked at 41% in June 2021, with Labour at 30%.In October that year, there was a sense Johnson was untouchable. At the Tory party conference, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg remarked how the PM was ""in total command of his party, and politically dominant in the country"".But this fell apart quickly with the Partygate scandal, which emerged in November that year. Time and again, reports emerged of government and Tory staff ‚Äì including Johnson ‚Äì having taken part in lockdown-era social gatherings when their own COVID rules had prohibited them.By January 2022, Tory support had plummeted to 28%, with Labour on 38%. Johnson struggled on, but never recovered and a wave of ministerial resignations forced him to resign in July that year.The UK had three separate prime ministers ‚Äì Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak ‚Äì between 6 September and 24 October, 2022. (Getty Images)His successor, Liz Truss, then embarked on arguably the most disastrous prime ministerial reign in history, characterised by the catastrophic ""mini-budget"", containing ¬£45bn of unfunded tax cuts, which prompted an economic crisis. Like Johnson, she lost the confidence of Tory MPs ‚Äì and voters ‚Äì and had to resign.Her 49-day spell as PM was the shortest in history, with Tory support plummeting to 19% (with Labour on 56%) the day after she announced her resignation in October 2022.Rishi Sunak, who had lost to Truss in the previous month's Tory leadership election, took over. However, as the above YouGov chart indicates, he has failed to cut through with voters. Tory support was at 23% two days after he assumed office, with the most recent survey, carried out on Thursday, showing support is now lower than under Truss at 18%.In short, the polls and odds, not to mention other factors such as notable by-election victories for Starmer's Labour, are pointing to a Labour government next week.Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

Yahoo News UK,"Three important UK election issues, explainedRishi Sunak said his leadership is needed in 'uncertain' times. Keir Starmer said the country needs to be 'rebuilt'. So what issues do voters care about most?","['The economy', 'Health', 'Immigration and asylum']",James Cheng-Morris,Updated 28 May 2024 at 11:11 am¬∑5-min read,28,May,2024,11:11:00,5,"After months of speculation, Rishi Sunak confirmed the general election will be held on 4 July.The prime minister said Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer could not be trusted to lead the country through ‚Äúuncertain‚Äù times. He made the economy and combating global security the key elements of his pitch to the nation as he announced the election date.In response, Starmer told voters: ‚ÄúTogether we can stop the chaos, we can turn the page, we can start to rebuild Britain.‚ÄùBut amid this ‚Äúuncertainty‚Äù and need to ‚Äúrebuild‚Äù, what do the voters consider the key issues?This chart, produced using YouGov polling over the course of this parliament, offers an insight in the issues voters care most about and how that has ebbed and flowed over time.Compared to when Boris Johnson's Tories won the December 2019 poll, the economy, immigration, defence and tax have grown in importance in the eyes of the electorate. This has come amid the cost of living crisis; small boats crossing the English Channel; the onset of the Ukraine war and wider global instability; and the highest tax burden in 70 years.Housing has also become a bigger concern, with the Renters Reform Bill - in which the government pledged to scrap no-fault evictions - having been paused after Sunak called the election.Meanwhile, the last general election was fought - and won by the Tories - on a single issue: Brexit. Yet the chart shows a clear downturn in its relevance among voters, particularly after a trade deal was agreed with the EU in December 2020.This next chart, meanwhile, highlights what voters have considered the top issues over the past year. By a wide margin, the top three are the economy, health and immigration and asylum.Here, Yahoo News UK breaks down what is behind these issues and how they have ebbed and flowed in importance among voters since the last election in 2019.The economyThe unprecedented lockdown called by Boris Johnson in March 2020 meant the public‚Äôs attention shifted to the economy, as demonstrated by the huge spike in the chart above. The then-chancellor Rishi Sunak was forced to implement a ¬£70bn furlough scheme, lasting 18 months, to protect people‚Äôs jobs.There was a second almighty economic shock - and rise in public concern - in February 2022 following Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. This caused a further spike in an already turbulent wholesale energy market, driving up costs for suppliers and ultimately customers.Average energy bills eventually reached ¬£2,500 a year (and would have exceeded ¬£4,000 had the government not intervened). This was double the ¬£1,278 consumers were paying before the war and by the time this election takes place, people will still be paying much more than this: ¬£1,568.Energy prices were also a key driver in inflation reaching 11.1% - a 41-year high - by October 2022, though it has since fallen to 2.3%, which is near the Bank of England‚Äôs 2.0% target.The third economic shock of this parliament - and most damaging for the Tories - was in October 2022 when Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng's disastrous ‚Äúmini budget‚Äù, containing ¬£45bn of unfunded tax cuts, prompted an economic crisis. It led to soaring interest rates, and to this day homeowners who are remortgaging are facing significantly higher bills.HealthHealth, like the economy, is another issue which clearly correlated with the beginning of the pandemic. The above chart shows an enormous spike in public concern when COVID cases started to multiply in March 2020, ultimately leading to the nationwide lockdown as the NHS faced collapse.Cases fell that summer, but spikes in the chart can be seen once infections rose again and fresh nationwide lockdowns were imposed in October 2020 and January 2021. By March 2022, likely as concerns over the Omicron variant faded, there was much less concern about health.In January last year, there was a brief spike as the NHS in England experienced the biggest industrial action in its history, with tens of thousands of nurses and ambulance staff walking out simultaneously.As for the state of play going into the election, NHS waiting lists remain higher than they were when Sunak vowed to cut them last year. According to the latest figures, an estimated 7.54 million treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of March, relating to 6.29 million patients.Immigration and asylumSince the last election, the immigration and asylum narrative has largely revolved around one issue: small boats crossing the English Channel.The numbers have risen in most of the intervening years: there were 1,843 crossings in 2019, 8,466 in 2020, 28,526 in 2021, 45,774 in 2022 and 29,437 last year. This year, the number has already passed the 10,000 mark.The regular sharp spikes in the above chart demonstrate how frequently crossings have been in the news, including some occasions when hundreds of migrants have made the dangerous journey in a single day.But it also reflects how the government has made this part of its own agenda. It was Boris Johnson‚Äôs government which first announced plans to deport migrants to Rwanda in April 2022. That policy was picked up by Rishi Sunak when he became prime minister in October that year, with Sunak since repeating his pledge to ‚Äústop the boats‚Äù.But after calling the election, Sunak admitted this week that flights would not take off before the country goes to the polls.Read moreFive important laws that could be dropped due to Sunak's snap election (Yahoo News UK)OPINION - Rishi Sunak has been in last-ditch campaign mode for so long ‚Äî a General Election is logical (Evening Standard)Door open for Boris Johnson to campaign for Tories, Rishi Sunak signals (PA Media)"

She also had the highest net satisfaction rating of any Cabinet minister among readers of the influential ConservativeHome website in May. She came fourth in the contest to succeed Boris Johnson in July 2022, and has hinted at a potential Tory leadership run after the election. She may be well placed in Westminster, given that Savanta‚Äôs bombshell MRP poll for The Telegraph forecast she would be the only ‚Äúbig beast‚Äù left standing after polling day.Leader of the House of Commons, Portsmouth NorthPenny Mordaunt came third in the 2022 leadership contest, and boosted her popularity and her name recognition with her prominent ceremonial role at last year‚Äôs Coronation. She was the third most popular Cabinet minister among ConservativeHome readers in May. However, if the Savanta projection is correct, she is on track to lose her seat to Labour on July 4.Former Home Secretary, Fareham and WaterloovilleDespite remaining popular with the Tory base, who admired her tough stance on illegal migration, Ms Braverman might struggle to beat Mrs Badenoch for the support of the Right of the party, having made an early exit in the 2022 leadership race. The Savanta poll also suggests she is set to lose her seat to Labour at the general election.Home Secretary, BraintreeHaving served as education secretary, foreign secretary, and now Home Secretary, Mr Cleverly is one of the Cabinet‚Äôs more experienced pairs of hands, though he ranked only 14th among ministers in ConservativeHome‚Äôs poll in May.¬† However, the Army Reserve Lieutenant Colonel is yet another Tory heavyweight likely to lose his seat, according to the Savanta survey, threatening to scupper any leadership ambitions he might harbour.Former Home Secretary, WithamTipped as a grassroots favourite, Ms Patel was recently urged by supporters to stand for the Tory leadership if the party is defeated at the election. Friends said she had not ruled out the possibility of standing but was focused on retaining her Witham constituency in Essex, which she is set to lose to Labour, according to the Savanta poll.Former Prime Minister, Member of the House of LordsThe Foreign Secretary, could technically make a dramatic return as Tory leader, given that there is no requirement for the head of the official opposition (or indeed any opposition party) to hold a seat in the House of Commons. However, such a move would be unprecedented in modern times. The former premier may also pay heed to the fact that he had a negative approval rating with ConservativeHome readers in May.Leader of Reform UK, Not currently an MPMr Farage is currently doing his level best to unseat as many Tory (and Labour) MPs as possible, presumably making him rather unpopular with the Conservative base. But some have speculated he could take the reins from Mr Sunak by defecting from inside Westminster, if he succeeds in his eighth bid to become an MP.Former Prime Minister, Not currently an MPCould Mr Johnson be the Tories‚Äô once and future king? He will not be an MP on July 4, having given up his seat in June last year and opted not to run again. But, like Lord Cameron, he could technically lead from outside Westminster.Minister for Northern Ireland, WycombeMr Baker has indicated that he would put his name forward if he retains his seat in Wycombe, where he has a majority of just 4,214, on July 4. He was previously a senior Tory backbencher, chairing the European Research Group (ERG) of Brexiteer MPs twice during the run up to Britain‚Äôs formal departure from the European Union on January 31 2020."

Although a more seasoned politician now, he lacks the popular appeal of Ms Sturgeon.In the election campaign, the future of North Sea oil and gas has been a major issue in Scotland, with a succession of SNP figures struggling to give a clear answer on the new drilling.Mr Swinney himself has come under pressure over the SNP‚Äôs handling of devolved policy areas, such as education and health.Despite these being run from Holyrood, there is evidence that many Scottish voters are becoming increasingly disillusioned with the state of schools and the health service.Read the latest election pollsFollow The Telegraph‚Äôs general election live coverageHere is a look at what the SNP has promised in its 32-page pledge and what this may mean for Mr Swinney‚Äôs chances at the general election.IndependenceTax and spendingHealth and social careWelfareDefence and foreign affairsEuropean UnionImmigrationEnergy and environmentJohn Swinney with his party's 2024 manifesto at the SNP launch in Edinburgh on June 19 - Jeff J MitchellIndependence‚ÄúDeliver independence‚Äù in ScotlandBegin immediate negotiations with the UK GovernmentDevolve new powers to HolyroodSupport abolition of House of LordsAs had been promised, independence is emblazoned on ‚Äúpage one, line one‚Äù of the party‚Äôs manifesto, which states: ‚ÄúVote SNP for Scotland to become an independent country.‚ÄùHowever, while it asserts that the SNP can ‚Äúdeliver independence‚Äù, the document sheds very little light on how this could be achieved in practice.The SNP manifesto states that the devolved government in Edinburgh would be ‚Äúempowered to begin immediate negotiations with the UK Government to give democratic effect to Scotland becoming an independent country‚Äù should the SNP win a majority of Scottish seats.Mr Swinney has said his preferred route to independence would be a referendum, though any calls for this would be certainly rejected by the UK Government, whether led by Sir Keir Starmer or Rishi Sunak.Interestingly, the manifesto emphasises what the SNP claims is an existing mandate for independence from the last Holyrood elections, saying it is ‚Äúmore important than ever for the mandate won in 2021 to be respected‚Äù.Pressed by journalists, Mr Swinney repeatedly refused to concede that his party would lose its claimed independence mandate should it fail to win a majority of Scottish seats.The manifesto attempts on multiple occasions to link independence to what polls suggest Scottish voters generally consider more pressing issues, such as the economy, NHS and the cost of living.Other constitutional policies include the devolution of a swathe of new powers to Holyrood and to support the abolition of the House of Lords.Tax and spending‚ÄúFull devolution‚Äù of tax powers to HolyroodEndorse windfall taxes on Scottish businessesSupport Labour‚Äôs VAT raid on private schoolsThe SNP have hiked income taxes on everyone earning over ¬£28,000 in Scotland, but would like to go further according to its manifesto.The party is demanding the ‚Äúfull devolution‚Äù of tax powers to Holyrood so that more cash can be raised.Mr Swinney said the SNP could¬†‚Äúensure rates and thresholds fit our progressive income tax rates‚Äù with the devolution of National Insurance.It also appears to be endorsing a series of windfall taxes on Scottish businesses, claiming powers to impose them would ‚Äútackle the twin crises of cost of living and climate change while meeting the specific needs of Scotland‚Äù.The party has also backed Labour‚Äôs proposal to impose VAT on private schools.Find out how Sir Keir Starmer‚Äôs manifesto comparesCurrent fiscal rules would be scrapped under the SNP and replaced with a new set of guidelines allowing more investment in public services.However, the lack of cost details means it is hard to say how these promises would be paid for.Health and social careDemand an extra ¬£10bn for Scottish NHSEnd health service privatisationIncrease NHS pay by at least ¬£6bnThe SNP has demanded that the UK Government pumps an extra ¬£10 billion annually into the NHS, claiming this would ‚Äúaddress rampant inflationary pressures and improve performance‚Äù.In addition, the party wants the UK Government to match the more generous pay deals Holyrood has agreed with NHS workers to prevent strikes, but is now causing it financial difficulties.This would cost a further ¬£6 billion across the UK and result in a total boost to the Scottish Government‚Äôs budget of ¬£1.6 billion.The party is also saying it would introduce a ‚Äúkeep the NHS in public hands bill‚Äù to protect the health service.Despite being fully devolved, the SNP has begun warning that only a vote for the nationalists will protect the NHS from privatisation.Opponents have seen this as a sign of desperation from the SNP, particularly as waiting times in Scotland have spiralled to record levels and performance is deteriorating.WelfareScrap two child benefit capOffer free food and energy to low-income groupsDemand full compensation for WASPI womenAt his manifesto launch, Mr Swinney repeatedly attacked Labour over its refusal to promise to scrap the two child benefit cap introduced in 2017.The SNP manifesto says the policy has caused ‚Äúunnecessary suffering‚Äù and must go.While the party has not included costs in its manifesto, independent researchers have estimated that scrapping the policy, which limits benefit payments to two children in a household, would cost ¬£3.4 billion per year.The manifesto also appears to include a vague commitment to effectively offering free food and energy for low-income groups.It backs legislation introducing an ‚Äúessentials guarantee‚Äù to ensure ‚Äúeveryone can afford basic necessities like food and utilities‚Äù.The SNP is also demanding ‚Äúfull, fast and fair compensation‚Äù for WASPI women, who claim they were wrongly disadvantaged over pension changes.John Swinney campaigning with Edinburgh South West candidate Joanna Cherry on June 12 - Jane BarlowDefence and foreign affairsScrap Trident nuclear deterrentRecognise Palestinian stateIncrease international aid budgetRaise minimum military age to 18The SNP‚Äôs flagship defence policy is to scrap the Trident nuclear deterrent.It says the money saved from retiring Britain‚Äôs nuclear submarines could instead be spent on ‚Äúconventional defence and public services‚Äù.The party also wants the UK to demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and immediately recognise Palestine as a state.The UK‚Äôs international aid budget should be increased to 0.7 per cent, according to the SNP, while the minimum age for joining the UK military should be raised to 18.The party does not put forward a policy on what proportion of GDP should be spent on defence, against the NATO target of 2 per cent.European UnionRe-enter the single marketRestore free movement for EU citizensRejoin the EU following as independent stateThe SNP wants to ‚Äúreverse the damage of Brexit and re-enter the single market restoring free movement for EU citizens‚Äù.However, it appears to concede that the UK will not be rejoining the EU, instead emphasising a ‚Äúvision for an independent Scotland in the EU‚Äù.The manifesto states that Brexit has been a ‚Äúdisaster‚Äù for Scotland and wiped billions from the Scottish economy.But, there is no detail about how Scotland would meet membership requirements even if Scotland were to achieve independence.Scottish civil servants have estimated that it could take nearly a decade for a Scottish state to gain entry, from the point of leaving the UK, in what would be a lengthy and highly complex process.There is also nothing about how trade barriers would be created with the rest of the UK ‚Äì by far Scotland‚Äôs largest market ‚Äì or inevitable border checks would be overcome.ImmigrationReturn of free movement from the EUPowers to issue work permits to foreignersIntroduce post-study and family visasMore welcome regime for asylum seekersScotland‚Äôs working age population is expected to shrink over the coming decades, creating a demographic timebomb with fewer working people to pay for services for a larger number of elderly pensioners.The SNP favours a much more liberal immigration policy than the UK Government, including the return of free movement from the EU.It also wants Holyrood to have powers to issue work permits to foreigners, based on the distinctive needs of the Scottish economy. New working visas, five-year post-study visas and family visas with much lower barriers than the UK currently uses would be introduced.The SNP has called for a much more welcome regime for asylum seekers and his government has argued that an independent Scotland would allow them to work and claim benefits.Energy and environmentIntroduce climate compatibility assessments on fossil fuelsBring in climate reparationsInvest ¬£28bn in green economyThe 2024 manifesto does not restate the SNP government‚Äôs existing position that there should be a ‚Äúpresumption‚Äù against new oil and gas developments in the North Sea.However, it does not fully endorse them either, instead saying there should be an ‚Äúevidence based approach to oil and gas‚Äù.Any further extraction of fossil fuels must only go ahead following a ‚Äúrobust climate compatibility assessment‚Äù, though there is no detail on what this would entail.The SNP wants Labour to resurrect its abandoned plan to invest at least ¬£28 billion a year in the green economy and Mr Swinney‚Äôs party rules out any new nuclear power plants in Scotland.The manifesto endorses the idea of climate reparations and calls for more investment in ‚Äúloss and damage‚Äù.This is where richer countries, who have historically emitted the most greenhouse gases, make payments to developing countries hit by climate change.It demands that ‚Äúthe UK Government must provide a new contribution to the new Loss and Damage Fund which is truly additional to existing commitments‚Äù.Can you vote for the SNP in England?The SNP have only ever fielded candidates in Scotland and will not be contesting any seats in England or Wales.Standing candidates outside of Scotland runs counter to the party‚Äôs central aim of negotiating another independence referendum."
Herald Scotland,Poll: 'Labour slips behind SNP ahead of election day',[],Jody Harrison,3 July 2024 at 3:34 am¬∑2-min read,3,July,2024,03:34:00,2,"Labour has slipped behind the SNP days before election day, a new poll suggests.A survey by Savanta for The Scotsman suggests 31% of Scots could vote Labour on Thursday, three points down on the last poll, while support for the SNP is unchanged at 34%.According to analysis from Professor Sir John Curtice, Labour, which won just one seat north of the border in the 2019 election, is on course for 22 Scottish MPs while the SNP would keep 24 seats.The poll, carried out between June 28 and July 2, suggests the Conservatives are on 15%, up one point, while the Liberal Democrats are at 9%, up two points on the last poll earlier in June.The latest poll of 1,083 Scottish adults found 6% said they would back Reform UK, no change since the last poll, while the Greens were up one point at 3%, and 2% said they would vote for other parties.First Minister John Swinney (Image: PA)Chris Hopkins, political research director at Savanta, said: ‚ÄúOur final Scottish voting intention before 4 July suggests the SNP is ahead of Labour, showing a modest improvement and potentially blunting their losses on election night.‚ÄúIf our results were reflected on polling day, John Swinney‚Äôs election as SNP leader looks like it will have come just in the nick of time.‚ÄúThat being said, Labour‚Äôs efficient vote, in particular around the central belt, will still mean it‚Äôs likely going to be a very good evening for Anas Sarwar and Keir Starmer.‚ÄúTheir majority is no longer dependent on Scotland, but they‚Äôll want to squeeze the SNP as much as they can.‚ÄùREAD MORE:¬†Swinney in last ditch plea to ex-SNP voters backing LabourREAD MORE:¬†An election campaign the Conservatives will want to forgetSavanta‚Äôs poll also suggests the SNP, unchanged at 37%, is ahead of Labour in the Holyrood constituency voting intention, with the latter at 32%, down three points on the last poll.The poll puts the Conservatives on 16%, up two points, while the Liberal Democrats are on 9%, up one point, with 6% saying they would vote for others, up one point.The Holyrood list vote was much closer, with the SNP on 29% (down two points), Labour on 28% (down one point) and the Conservatives on 16%, also down one point.The Greens were on 11%, up two points, the Lib Dems on 11%, also up two points, and support for ‚Äúother‚Äù was at 5%, up one point.Analysis by Professor Curtice suggested that if these results were reflected at election time, the SNP would remain the largest party in Holyrood with 46 MSPs.The Labour Party would be a close second with 37 MSPs, and the Conservatives would be reduced to 21 MSPs."
Sky News,Labour plans to delay summer recess if it wins election,[],Sky News,Updated 2 July 2024 at 3:26 pm¬∑4-min read,2,July,2024,03:26:00,4,"Labour is planning to push back the summer recess for MPs until the end of July if it wins the election, Sky News understands.If Sir Keir enters Downing Street as prime minister, some of the first things on his agenda will be to appoint his new Cabinet and have new MPs sworn into parliament.It is understood that the King's speech - where the monarch reads out the government's legislative agenda - will take place two weeks later on 17 July.Sky's political editor Beth Rigby said on her Electoral Dysfunction podcast that parliament would normally wrap up after the King's Speech - but that a Labour government would keep the Commons active until the end of July before calling recess, with MPs returning in September.Election latest: 'Enormous increase' in postal votes - as Starmer faces questions over cabinet rumoursBefore the election was called, the summer recess was due to begin on 23 July - but considering this is only six days after the King's Speech Sir Keir will likely need more sitting days to have his agenda approved by newly elected MPs.As the general election campaign enters its final days, the Tories have found a new attack line to deploy against Sir Keir - that his desire to stop working after 6pm on Fridays to spend time with his children would make him a ""part-time prime minister"".üëâ Click here to follow Electoral Dysfunction wherever you get your podcasts üëàSir Keir, who has two teenage children, said he would continue to have ""protected time for the kids"" at the end of the week if he were to take over as prime minister on 5 July.The Conservatives branded the Labour leader a ""part-time prime minister"" - but Sir Keir responded by labelling the attacks ""laughably pathetic"".Sir Keir explained that he carved out Friday nights because his wife's family is Jewish and they observe family prayers.'The Conservatives used to be the party of family'Ayesha Hazarika, a former Labour adviser, told the podcast she was ""absolutely flabbergasted by this whole Conservative campaign"".""It's so interesting when you look at how desperate the Conservative Party are right now - the Conservative Party used to be the party of the family,"" she said.""It was really proud of being the party of the family and now it's having a go at somebody because he wants to observe, Friday night with his Jewish wife and kids.""With 48 hours to go, who thought that an attack on families with a little dollop of antisemitism, you know, thrown in, would be the final kind of attack line? It's utterly, utterly stupid and it's really self-defeating as well.""She said she had worked with politicians who have been on duty ""24/7 and didn't have a break, and I think they were poorer for it actually"".Ms Hazarika highlighted the work ethic of Gordon Brown, who as well as being prime minister was a Presbyterian.""Gordon Brown famously really struggled because he had this real Presbyterian work ethic,"" she said.""I remember one point we were coming up to the summer and he sort of had to take a break. He kind of didn't want to take a break because he'd fought so long, waited such a long time to become prime minister.""His advisers were like, 'you've got to take a summer break, because it kind of looks a bit weird if you don't take a summer break'.Read more:Is it possible to 'ringfence' family time when you're prime minister?Tories plot letter from SME backers in last-ditch bid to turn election tide""And of course, his summer break, I think... he still wore his shirt and tie and his suit the whole time during a summer break.

The term is also sometimes used to refer to the election itself, as in ‚Äòthey could not win at the ballot box‚Äô.CampaignThe time before an election in which politicians persuade people to vote for them. In the case of the 2024 election in the UK, parliament was dissolved on the 30 May and the election will take place on 4 July.CanvassingGoing round a particular area trying to persuade people to vote for one party or the other.In UK elections, this is often done by volunteers knocking on people‚Äôs doors.Capital gains taxCapital gains tax is a tax on profit when people sell assets that have increased in value.In the 2024 election, the Conservatives have promised that landlords who sell to sitting tenants will be spared capital gains tax on the proceeds, while Labour has left the door open to raising capital gains.Child benefitChild benefit is a benefit paid to parents with children under 16 (or under 20 in approved education or training).The Conservatives have promised to increase the threshold at which high earners start to lose the benefit from ¬£60,000 to ¬£120,000.Sir Keir Starmer, like the Conservatives, has pledged not to raise VAT. (Photo by Stefan Rousseau/PA Images via Getty Images)CoalitionA coalition government is a government formed jointly by more than one political party (for example, by the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives in 2010).ConstituencyThe geographical area that is represented by each MP in the House of Commons.ECHRThe European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is an international convention which protects human rights in Europe.The Conservative manifesto stopped short of promising to withdraw from the ECHR, which would have made plans such as the plan to deport migrants to Rwanda easier.Exit pollA poll conducted outside polling stations just after people have voted on election day.On election day, the results of Britain‚Äôs exit poll are published just after polls close at 10pm and tend to give a more accurate prediction of the result than previous polls produced throughout the campaign.First past the postThe first past the post system is used to elect MPs to the House of Commons.The candidate with the most votes in each constituency becomes MP, and the party with the most MPs becomes the government.This can mean that the winning party actually has a minority of votes cast: in 2019, the Conservatives had 43.6% of the vote.Hung parliamentA hung parliament is where no party has enough seats to form an overall majority. For example, both the 2010 election and 2017 elections resulted in hung parliament.In 2010, the Conservatives formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, while in 2017, the Conservatives formed a minority government with a 'confidence and supply' agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).Income tax thresholdThe thresholds between the tax-free allowance, basic rate tax and higher rates of tax.Both parties have said they will continue the freeze on income tax thresholds brought in under the Conservatives, which means people pay more tax as more and more people are pushed into higher tax brackets if wages rise.MajorityA party with a majority ‚Äì more than half of the seats in the House of Commons ‚Äì has won the election.The number of votes by which an individual MP wins a constituency is also referred to as their majority.ManifestoPolitical parties publish manifestos before a general election, with a set of policies that the party stands for and aims to implement if elected.Manifesto pledges are not legally binding.Marginal seatA seat in which the incumbent MP won by a small majority, meaning a swing is more likely than in a so-called ‚Äòsafe seat‚Äô where the MP had a large majority.Net zeroThe UK Government has set a goal for Britain‚Äôs emissions to reach net zero ‚Äì where emission and removal of greenhouse gases reaches equilibrium ‚Äì by 2050.All major parties are expected to stick to this goal, barring Reform UK.Opinion pollAn opinion poll is a research survey (usually carried out on a representative sample of the electorate) to gauge likely results in an election.Poll‚ÄòThe polls‚Äô refers to the places where people vote in an election: exit polls and opinion polls refer to two kinds of survey used to predict election results.Postal voteAn absentee vote where the vote is sent in by post.At the 2019 general election, 17.2% of voters across the UK used a postal ballot.Proxy voteA vote where a person who can‚Äôt make it to the booth appoints someone to vote for them.In the 2019 election, 0.6% of voters appointed a proxy.PsephologyPsephology is the scientific study of elections and voting and is used to predict and analyse election results.Polling dayThe day when the country places their vote: in the UK 2024 election, this is July 4.PurdahBefore British elections, the country enters purdah, officially known as the ‚Äòpre-election period of sensitivity‚Äô.Purdah means that politicians (both local and national) and other people such as civil servants face restrictions on what they can do and announce.Ministers who remain in office can‚Äôt announce new funding, or new policies, or anything which might sway voters or make the government more popular.The idea is that public money cannot be spent on the election.Spoiled ballotA ballot paper which has been marked wrongly (for instance with a vote for more than one candidate) will not be counted.Sometimes people spoil ballots deliberately as a protest vote to show dissatisfactionSwing‚ÄòSwing‚Äô is the change in voter support for a political party between one election and the next.It is used to analyse the performance of parties in different areas.Tax burdenThe tax burden refers to the total amount of taxes paid by a group (in this case the UK as a whole) as a proportion of total income.The tax burden is currently at its highest in 70 years according to the OECD.The Equality ActThe 2010 Equality Act protects people against discrimination in Britain.The Conservatives want to ‚Äòtweak‚Äô the Act so that sex-based protections only apply on the basis of someone‚Äôs biological sex.Triple lockThe triple lock is a guarantee introduced to the state pension in 2010 so it would not lose value in real terms.The guarantee means that the state pension will rise by the highest out of average earnings, inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) or 2.5%.Triple lock plusThe ‚Äòtriple lock plus‚Äô is a Conservative policy, which would see the tax-free pension allowance rise every year in line with the triple lock of average wages, inflation, or 2.5% ‚Äì whichever is highest, to prevent pensioners being pulled into paying income tax.TurnoutTurnout refers to the percentage of people eligible to vote who turn out to vote on election day.In the 2019 election, for example, 67.3% of those eligible turned out to vote.VATValue added tax is added to goods and services sold by VAT-registered companies, and is the third-largest source of government income after income tax and national insurance.Both Labour and the Conservatives have pledged not to raise VAT.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

It is also the case that Labour never expected him to be the party‚Äôs next prime minister, and from the public‚Äôs point of view there is still considerable confusion over what he stands for.Yet opinion polls consistently point to Sir Keir ‚Äì who came so close to walking off the political stage entirely ‚Äì as the next occupant of 10 Downing Street.Read the latest election pollsFollow The Telegraph‚Äôs general election live coverageThat he has turned a 20-point deficit in those polls into a 20-point lead in his time as leader owes much to the Tories‚Äô self-immolation, but it would be wrong to dismiss Sir Keir‚Äôs contribution to that turnaround.Keir Starmer working in his flat above a sauna and massage parlour in the 1980s - HARPER COLLINSBy purging Labour of Momentum, Jeremy Corbyn and anti-Semites, Sir Keir has done much to detoxify the brand. Before voters go to the polls, however, they will want to be sure that they know what they are getting if they are tempted to vote Labour ‚Äì and that means knowing more about the man who leads the party.Even Sir Keir‚Äôs tame biographer Tom Baldwin, a former adviser to their mutual friend Ed Miliband, describes him as ‚Äúpeculiarly hard to pin down‚Äù, which is not an encouraging start for those tasked with curating the image of a would-be prime minister.Sir Keir has summed up his political outlook by saying: ‚ÄúIf I see something wrong or spot an injustice, I want to put it right,‚Äù a phrase that might have been uttered by any politician, of any party, at any point in time.He has also proudly described how one of his achievements as director of public prosecutions (DPP) was ‚Äúgetting the boring stuff right‚Äù.In time, that phrase might be equally applicable as a description of how he ended up in charge of the country at the age of 61.Sir Keir said he got 'the boring stuff right' during his time as director of public prosecutions - JOHN STILLWELL/PAUnlike Sir Tony Blair, the last Labour leader to win a general election, Sir Keir can genuinely lay claim to working-class roots. But where Sir Tony was unapologetic about his middle-class status, Starmer appears uncomfortable with the man he has become.Sir Keir has so often referred to his father‚Äôs occupation as a toolmaker that it has become the go-to punchline for political cartoonists.Much ink has been expended in arguing about whether Rodney Starmer was a mere factory hand or the boss of his own one-man business, but there is no doubting the fact that Sir Keir‚Äôs childhood was lived in straitened circumstances that moulded the man we see today.Sir Keir was born on Sep 2, 1962, the second of four children. His older sister, Anna, was born the year before him and twins, Katy and Nick, followed in 1964.Soon after he was born, the family moved to the pebble-dashed home in Hurst Green, near Oxted, to which he so often refers, saying it gave the family stability.Money was tight: Katy has said that the house flooded once and it was years before they could afford to redecorate, and when Sir Keir kicked a football through a back window his father boarded it up, unable to pay for a glazer.His mother Josephine, a nurse, had Still‚Äôs disease, a rare type of inflammatory arthritis which meant she had to have her hips and knees replaced twice and became a wheelchair user in later life.Some of Sir Keir‚Äôs friends have suggested in the past that if he appears lacking in emotion, it is a result of growing up with a parent who had a serious illness, which leads a child to suppress their own needs and feelings.Added to that was the fact that his brother Nick had learning difficulties, which meant Sir Keir‚Äôs parents had a lot on their hands.He was not afraid to use his fists as a child and would get into fights with people who bullied his brother, with whom he shared a bunk bed decorated with posters of Debbie Harry, the Blondie singer.He now says he has no patience for people who complain about being ill when they are not very ill, and that the challenges he faces as a politician ‚Äúpale into insignificance‚Äù compared with what his mother had to face.Childhood friends of Sir Keir say his father, a staunch Labour supporter, was powerfully built and physically intimidating and would interrogate visitors about their political views.Sir Keir has gone as far as to say that his father was ‚Äúa difficult sod‚Äù who ‚Äúdrove people away‚Äù and had no time for other people‚Äôs opinions. Family meals would be eaten in silence while Mr Starmer read his newspaper, and he only allowed a television in the house when Josephine took an Open University course (Sir Keir was only allowed to watch one programme per week: Match of the Day).Sir Keir now thinks his father ‚Äúcarried quite heavily‚Äù a belief that other people looked down on him because he was a manual worker, even though he believes he was bright enough to have gone to university if he had lived in a different era.Sir Keir at his wedding with wife Victoria, father Rodney and mother Josephine, who has Still's disease - KEIR STARMER/LABOUR PARTYFamily holidays were spent in the Lake District when the four children and their four dogs would all cram into the back seat of Mr Starmer‚Äôs Ford Cortina.Mr and Mrs Starmer fell in love with the Lakes when they went there on honeymoon (the only time in her life that Josephine flew on an aircraft, to Manchester) and visited 77 times. They also became lifelong friends with Alfred Wainwright, the Lakeland author, after coming across him in the hills.The four Starmer siblings all attended a primary school in the village of Merle Common, around four miles from Tanhouse Road. Sir Keir passed the 11-plus and went to Reigate Grammar School, unlike his three siblings, who called him ‚Äúsuperboy‚Äù because he was so good at everything, from academia to music to football.He became such an accomplished flautist that on Saturdays he went to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, where he had a youth scholarship. Unsurprisingly, he also became a prefect and attained a Gold Duke of Edinburgh‚Äôs Award.His attendance at Reigate Grammar School would prove controversial in later life. It would have become a comprehensive school had it not been for a directive issued by Margaret Thatcher as education secretary, and instead went private, though boys who were already at the school, including Sir Keir, did not have to pay.Keir Starmer in his first year at Reigate Grammar School in 1974 - HARPER COLLINSCuriously, Sir Keir omitted any mention of the school in his Who‚Äôs Who entry when he first became DPP. He now wants to put VAT on school fees yet he has contributed to Reigate‚Äôs scholarship fund and has spoken at fundraising events. The Daily Mail has given him an ‚ÄúA* for hypocrisy‚Äù as a result.After a gap year which he divided between an outdoor pursuits centre for disabled children near Bodmin Moor and working in his father‚Äôs workshop, he won a place at the University of Leeds to study law, gaining a first-class degree.During his time there he went on demonstrations and gave money to miners‚Äô families during the strike in 1984, but he refuses to answer questions about whether he took drugs as a student, preferring to say he ‚Äúhad a very good time at university‚Äù. It included dating Angela O‚ÄôBrien, a fellow law student with whom he had a 10-year relationship.He also joined the university Labour Club, though he never ran for any posts within it and many prominent members of it have no memory of him attending at all. Like Lord Cameron, Sir Keir seems to have treated student politics as a passing interest rather than an all-consuming passion.A one-year Bachelor of Civil Law course at St Edmund Hall, University of Oxford followed, before a three-year spell working as the legal officer for Liberty, then called the National Council for Civil Liberties. At weekends, he gave free legal advice to women who worked in a massage parlour below his flat, that may or may not have been an actual massage parlour.Sir Keir Starmer celebrating his first-class degree in Law from the University of Leeds with his parents Rod and Jo in 1985 - HARPER COLLINSFreed from the intensity of his university studies, Sir Keir finally had time to devote to his hobby of politics and decided that the Labour Party was not radical enough for his liking. He joined the Socialist Society, founded by Ralph Miliband, Ed and David‚Äôs father, and Tony Benn, and helped set up a magazine called Socialist Alternatives, dedicated to an obscure branch of Trotskyism called Pabloism. It attacked Neil Kinnock‚Äôs ‚Äúhopeless‚Äù economic programme and demanded a ‚Äúradical alternative‚Äù.At the time, Sir Keir had such liberal beliefs on law and order that one friend has recalled him saying he did not believe in imprisonment ‚Äúfor anything, ever‚Äù.He expressed similarly naive views when he was interviewed for pupillage at his first barrister‚Äôs chambers. Asked how he would defend a first-time shoplifter he said: ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt all property theft?‚ÄùNevertheless, he was taken on by Doughty Street Chambers, founded by the prominent human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson. Its premises were next door to the offices of the Spectator magazine, edited at the time by Boris Johnson.Sir Keir made a name for himself by giving free legal advice to the defendants in the ‚ÄúMcLibel‚Äù case, in which McDonald‚Äôs sued two environmental activists over a factsheet critical of the burger chain. He appeared in a documentary about the case talking about how being made a Queen‚Äôs Counsel was odd because he used to campaign for the abolition of the monarchy.By 1997 he had made enough money as a barrister to buy a house in Stoke Newington with his new girlfriend and fellow barrister, Phillippa Kaufmann.They were together for six years and she still lives in the house they bought together. Then came a relationship with another lawyer, Julie Morris, a former gymnast, before Sir Keir met the woman he would finally marry, solicitor Victoria Alexander.Sir Keir's wife Victoria worked as a volunteer at Sir Tony Blair's campaign headquarters in 1997 - GETTYVictoria, who worked as a volunteer at Sir Tony‚Äôs campaign headquarters in 1997, is a decade younger than her husband and was far more politically active as a student than he had been.Her father was part of a Jewish family who arrived in England from Poland before the Second World War.The couple married on May 6, 2007, at the Fennes Estate in Essex, when Sir Keir was 44. By 2010 they had a son and a daughter, whom they occasionally take to a liberal synagogue in north London (though neither Sir Keir nor his wife professes to be religious).Back at Doughty Street Chambers, Sir Keir was busily fighting the government over the ongoing Iraq War, taking on, and beating, the Home Office in a series of cases that prevented control orders being imposed on suspected terrorists whom the security services feared would travel to Iraq to fight against the US-led coalition.By 2008 he had built such a legend within the legal world that he was offered the job of DPP, putting him in charge of 8,000 people in the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and hundreds of thousands of prosecutions.He has picked out one of his key achievements as replacing a paper-based system with a digital one, which meant fewer prosecutions were abandoned because of lost paperwork. It is this that he has cited as an example of how ‚Äúgetting the boring stuff right‚Äù can improve lives.One thing he did not do as DPP was prosecute Jimmy Savile. It was under his watch that the CPS decided not to prosecute the prolific paedophile on the grounds of insufficient evidence, a decision that was later criticised in a review of the case by a leading barrister. Sir Keir has always maintained the case did not come across his desk.One of the unfortunate consequences of the missed opportunity over Savile was Operation Midland, which dragged innocent men into an investigation about a VIP paedophile ring that was the invention of a fantasist called Carl Beech.After the Savile debacle, Sir Keir had authorised policy changes for dealing with sexual abuse cases that placed more emphasis on believing the purported victim.Sir Keir is often blamed for the 'believe the victim' mentality that allowed fantastist Carl Beech's claims to go unquestioned for so long - DAVID ROSEThe former Tory MP Harvey Proctor, who was falsely accused by Beech, blames Sir Keir personally for the ‚Äúbelieve the victim‚Äù policy that cost him his job, his reputation and his home after he was wrongly accused. Some of Beech‚Äôs victims later said Sir Keir was unfit to stand as Labour leader.By the 2010s, Sir Keir had decided that he had achieved as much as he could as a lawyer. He told his biographer Tom Baldwin that there were limits to legal justice and he wanted to be part of the apparatus of making the laws.‚ÄúI had a sense that to fix problems you had to pull levers only politicians could do,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI wanted to be part of making social justice.‚ÄùHe consulted his near neighbour Ed Miliband, who lives half a mile from him, and when Frank Dobson stood down from the Holborn and St Pancras seat in 2015, Sir Keir was picked as the candidate to replace him.He has lived in the constituency for more than 20 years, has a wallet with ‚ÄúTake Me Home To Kentish Town‚Äù written on the back, and is, of course, a fanatical supporter of Arsenal FC.He still plays football with friends he has had for decades, does so wearing a Donegal County Gaelic football shirt that he picked up when he was in Northern Ireland advising its police force, and, until recently at least, remained in charge of booking the pitch, team selection and contacting the players with details of when to arrive.Sir Keir pictured playing football in a Dongeal Gaelic Football top in North London in 2021 - GAVIN RODGERS/PIXEL8000When he was elected to Parliament at the age of 52, it would have been a proud moment for his mother, who had been struggling with her health, but she did not live to see it. In 2008 she had fallen and broken her leg, which had to be amputated. She also lost the power of speech.Mr Starmer used his engineering skills to make her a wheelchair adapted to her exact needs, and built an outhouse at the end of their garden where she could sit and be near the donkeys that the couple rescued and kept in a field that their MP son had bought for them.Mr Starmer planned out how he would get his disabled wife to Parliament to see his eldest son being sworn in as an MP in 2015, but she died a few days before he was elected, and Mr Starmer decided not to go on his own.Heartbroken, he moved into the outhouse he had built for his wife, putting her wedding ring beside the bed. He visited her grave most days, having his sandwich lunch there, even on Christmas Day.When Mr Starmer himself later ended up in hospital, there was a fire in the outhouse, destroying all of the photos and memories of their life together, and killing his dog. His children never told him, and he died in hospital without knowing. Sir Keir later found a scrapbook his father had kept, full of cuttings about his career, and friends said that after his wife died, they would find Mr Starmer sitting watching the BBC Parliament channel in the hope of catching sight of his son.In Parliament, Sir Keir chose to serve on Jeremy Corbyn‚Äôs front bench as shadow Brexit secretary, a decision that has dogged him ever since.He says he profoundly disagreed with Mr Corbyn, yet he stayed on his team. He says he accepts Brexit, but he campaigned for a second referendum, with Remain as an option. Rishi Sunak accuses him of blowing with the wind, unable to decide what he stands for other than seizing power.Sir Keir is a big football fan and supports Arsenal - LABOUR PARTYKnighted for his services as DPP, he insists on being called simply Keir Starmer in Parliament. Critics find this peculiar: his is a story of social mobility, of a man born without privilege who raised himself to high office through his own endeavours and with the help of an education system that includes good schools and world-class universities, yet he is somehow reluctant to celebrate this success. Instead, he constantly plays up his working-class roots, leaves his grammar school out of his biography and plays down his knighthood.Where Sir Tony had the self-confidence to own his middle-class status, turning it to his advantage by telling Tory voters he was not so different from them, Sir Keir, another north London lawyer, appears uncomfortable with his success, and this is surely one of the reasons that voters find him difficult to warm to.Colleagues say he first started talking about becoming leader when Mr Corbyn refused to blame Moscow for the Salisbury poisonings in 2018.In 2020 he got the job, making his victory speech from his living room because of the Covid pandemic. In it, he described anti-Semitism as ‚Äúa stain on our party‚Äù and promised to ‚Äútear out this poison by its roots and judge success by the return of Jewish members and those who felt that they could no longer support us‚Äù.Many Labour MPs thought he didn‚Äôt have it in him. Yet he matched words with action, sacking his beaten leadership rival Rebecca Long-Bailey for sharing online an interview in which the actor Maxine Peake claimed the police who killed George Floyd in the US had learnt their techniques from the Israeli secret services.The decision infuriated the Left, but there was more to come, as Diane Abbott, and even his predecessor Mr Corbyn, lost the whip over comments he judged to be unacceptable.By January 2022, around three hundred members had been expelled by the party, often after complaints of anti-Semitism, and thousands of Mr Corbyn‚Äôs supporters had quit.Sir Keir had purged his party of its most toxic elements, and in doing so removed the biggest barrier to Labour being electable.Otherwise, he made an unimpressive start as Labour leader. A poor communicator, he was regularly duffed up at the despatch box by Boris Johnson, who loved to goad him with the nickname Captain Hindsight (later promoted to General Indecision).By May 2021, after Labour lost the Hartlepool by-election, questions were being asked about whether Sir Keir might be the first Labour leader since George Lansbury in 1935 to step down without fighting an election. As noted above, he certainly considered it, telling friends he saw it as a personal rejection and that people would see it as the party going backwards.Sir Keir‚Äôs job, at that stage, was simply to win back enough seats from the Conservatives to give the next leader a genuine crack at power. After all, no party in history had overturned the sort of majority won by Boris Johnson in 2019 in one single leap.Then came partygate, Liz Truss, and a collapse in support for the Tory Party that no one could have foreseen.It has left Sir Keir as the odds-on favourite to be the next prime minister. It appears he might get there simply by ‚Äúgetting the boring stuff right‚Äù."

The Telegraph,Detained migrants earmarked for Rwanda released,[],Charles Hymas,2 July 2024 at 1:55 pm¬∑4-min read,2,July,2024,01:55:00,4,"Migrants detained ahead of deportation to Rwanda have been released as Home Office civil servants stand ready to axe the scheme if Labour wins the election.Three charities and a leading legal firm, representing some 200 detained migrants, told The Telegraph all of those they were supporting had been freed after applying to the courts for bail.It is understood immigration tribunal judges freed them after ruling that there was not a realistic prospect of their removal to Rwanda within a reasonable timescale.The migrants were detained in raids on their homes, or after they turned up at immigration centres, from late April. It was part of a Home Office operation, codenamed Vector and involving 800 enforcement officers, to get them ready for the first deportation flights to Rwanda.The first flight was originally scheduled for the end of June but delayed to July 24 after Rishi Sunak called the snap election in May.Mr Sunak was forced to provide the new date to the High Court, where the FDA, the top civil servants‚Äô union, is mounting a legal challenge against the policy.Through the election campaign, he has insisted that a ‚Äústeady drumbeat‚Äù of flights would take off through the summer from July 24 if he remained in power, providing a deterrent to stop small boat Channel crossings.However, Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has pledged to scrap the Rwanda scheme on ‚Äúday one‚Äù of a Labour government and would instead allow migrants to lodge claims for asylum in the UK.Labour plans to use the money saved from the Rwanda policy on a beefed-up border security command to crack down on people-smugglers at source.Lawyers for the migrants are preparing legal claims for compensation for unlawful detention on the basis that there was not a realistic prospect of their deportation to Rwanda and no evidence that they would have absconded had they remained free.Charities believe the uncertainty sparked by the election contributed to the decision to release the migrants. The Home Office has declined to say how many are still detained, but sources said it was not zero and that some were still being held. It has also not said how many were originally taken into detention.However, The Telegraph has established that all 115 detained Rwanda migrants supported by the charity Care4Calais have been freed on bail, as have all 50 represented by Duncan Lewis Solicitors, all 38 supported by Detention Action and all 20 represented by Bail for Immigration Detainees.Their release was determined by what are known as the Hardial Singh principles, named after a test case, which state that to be lawful detention must only be exercised when there is a realistic prospect of an individual‚Äôs removal within a reasonable timeframe.With Labour around 20 points ahead in the polls, the party is likely to form the next government and start dismantling the scheme.Some ¬£300 million has already been committed to Rwanda under the Migration and Economic Development Partnership with the African state, and cannot be reclaimed.However, there is a break clause in the agreement. Once activated, it will mean the Home Office can save on two further ¬£50 million payments in 2025 and 2026 as well as up to ¬£120 million, which would have to be paid once 300 people have been relocated, and on the ¬£20,000 payments per individual relocated.Last month, The Telegraph revealed how migrants in northern France said they were waiting for a Labour government before crossing the Channel after Sir Keir‚Äôs pledge to scrap the Rwanda scheme. Some said they were worried about the threat of being deported.However, a Labour spokesman said: ‚ÄúIf the Tories thought their Rwanda scheme would work, they wouldn‚Äôt have called an election before a flight could take off. Instead, as soon as the Prime Minister named a date for an election, many of those supposedly earmarked for removal were bailed.‚ÄúBy calling an election now, Sunak was acknowledging what many have been saying for a while ‚Äì the flights were never going to go and the whole Rwanda scheme was a long and extortionate saga we‚Äôve all been forced to sit through.‚ÄùA Tory spokesman said: ‚ÄúThe only way to get regular flights off to Rwanda and stop the boats is to vote Conservative. A vote for any other party means a Starmer government, which would cancel the fights.‚ÄúThe result of that will be the UK becoming the asylum capital of the world. It will mean record numbers of boat crossings, beginning the day that Keir Starmer and Yvette Cooper get into government.‚Äù"

The polls have consistently painted a very bleak picture for the prime minister, with Labour holding on to a double-digit poll lead over his Conservatives.Recent by-election results suggest that Labour is likely to win a landslide victory ‚Äì but there‚Äôs still time for the PM to turn it around.Here‚Äôs everything you need to know about Sunak and what‚Äôs he‚Äôs saying about the biggest issues in British politics right now.Early lifeSunak was born in Southampton in 1980, the eldest of three children. His Indian parents both arrived from East Africa in the 1960s. A football-mad boy whose childhood idol was Matt Le Tissier, Sunak was described by the family‚Äôs neighbours as a child with ‚Äúlovely manners‚Äù.In his youngest years, the PM attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. According to a recent biography, fellow pupil Ollie Case said: ‚ÄúHe was someone that was talked about. The teachers would say: ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs going to be prime minister'.""But, growing up in the 1980s and 90s, he also remembers experiencing racism. ‚ÄúMy mother was obsessed with us not having accents,‚Äù Sunak has said.Rishi Sunak was football-mad as a boy growing up in Southampton. (ITV)Sunak's familySunak is married to Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian entrepreneur and multi-billionaire. The pair first met in 2004 at Stanford University, his future wife apparently attracted to his ‚Äúhonesty and integrity‚Äù.Five years later they married in a two-day Indian wedding held in Bangalore. The couple have two daughters, Krishna and Anoushka, who will turn 13 and 11 this year, both of whom are largely kept out of the public eye.Sunak attended Oakmount, a local private prep school, and later Stroud School in Romsey. (Rishi Sunak, Instagram)His parentsYashvir Sunak, Rishi‚Äôs father, was born in Kenya. He arrived in the UK to study medicine and then stayed, becoming an NHS GP. His mother, Usha, was born in Tanzania and is a pharmacist.The couple met in Britain and settled in Southampton in the 1970s. Usha is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.His educationAs a teenager Sunak studied at Winchester College where he was, he says, a self-confessed ‚Äúgeek‚Äù. According to a recent biography, the ‚Äúnaughtiest‚Äù thing the prime minister did during his school days ‚Äúwas to smuggle a hand-held television into the school so that he did not miss any key games of Euro 96‚Äù.The childhood home of Rishi Sunak in Southampton. (Getty Images, photo taken in 2022)Perhaps unsurprisingly for someone with such an unblemished record, he went on to become the school‚Äôs head boy. Sunak worked while studying, delivering medicines for his mother‚Äôs pharmacy and as a waiter at a local Indian restaurant.After school, Sunk read philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, graduating in 2001 with a first class degree. While still at university he held an internship at the Conservative Party campaign headquarters and joined the party, but went on studying before entering politics.He earned his MBA from Stanford in 2006 as a Fulbright Scholar, meaning he was selected among the most promising candidates from the UK.How much is he worth?As prime minister, Rishi Sunak earns ¬£80,807 on top of a salary of ¬£84,144 for being an MP. But his current income from Westminster pales in comparison to his family‚Äôs vast wealth through marriage.The Sunday Times valued the couple‚Äôs joint fortune at ¬£730m. Murty's father is the co-founder of Infosys, an Indian tech conglomerate, in which she holds shares estimated at around ¬£430m. Her family is also involved in a ¬£900m business arrangement with Amazon in India, and she is a shareholder of multiple other companies.Rishi Sunak's mother is still the director and lead pharmacist at Sunak Pharmacy in Southampton.Before entering politics Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and a series of hedge funds. He is also known to have invested in blind trusts, in which investments are made without holders knowing where the funds are located. These arrangements reportedly hold Sunak‚Äôs own multi-million-pound fortune.His religionSunak is not only the first prime minister of colour and of Indian heritage but he is also the first practising Hindu to hold the biggest job in UK politics.He has spoken of his pride in his Hindu faith, saying, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs how I was raised, and that‚Äôs how I am‚Äù. He said: ‚ÄúHaving faith gives you resilience, gives you strength that is important and it provides an outlook on life which I find particularly valuable.‚ÄùSunak on... the NHSThe prime minister‚Äôs biggest challenge in office has been the crisis in the NHS - and to many people in the sector his government has been found wanting. ‚ÄúWe have not made enough progress,‚Äù Sunak said when asked about his commitment to cut NHS waiting lists during an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV. Asked if that meant he had failed, the prime minister replied: ‚ÄúYes, we have.""Sunak expects to see waiting lists start to reduce this spring, and blames the delays on ‚Äúindustrial action‚Äù, as disputes with junior doctors and consultants over pay and conditions continue. Yet Sunak himself has been blamed for holding up a deal that would prevent more walkouts.Sunak, his wife Akshata and daughters Anoushka and Krishna (second left) at Santa Monica Pier, California, on their summer holiday in 2023. (AP)Sunak on‚Ä¶ immigrationAccording to the prime minister, illegal migration threatens to ‚Äúoverwhelm‚Äù Europe. In June 2023 he claimed his plan to ‚Äústop the boats‚Äù and tackle illegal immigration was working, but by August 2023 he had changed his mind: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not an easy problem to fix,‚Äù he told broadcasters. ‚ÄúI never said we would be able to solve it overnight.‚ÄùHe has staked much of his reputation on the government's Rwanda Bill - his plan to deport asylum seekers to the east African country that finally became law last month, after months of legal and procedural challenges. It has paved the way for deportation flights to get off the ground within weeks.He described his policy, which he says will act as a deterrent to people traffickers, as being ‚Äúthe will of the people‚Äù ‚Äì yet polling suggests low support for such a punitive approach.The policy, coupled with Conservative talk of limits on legal migration, shows that the government is committed to taking a hard line on the issue, despite the risk of alienating more moderate voters.The Rwanda policy is not universally popular. (YouGov)Sunak on... the cost of living crisisThe prime minister has told hard-pressed working families that they will feel some relief from the cost of living crisis as inflation continues to drop following its highs of October 2022. He described the government‚Äôs tax cuts as ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù and has welcomed the dip in mortgage rates at the turn of the year.Sunak says falling inflation will have the biggest impact on family budgets ‚Äúand will start to ease some of those pressures‚Äù and that he was right to focus on that figure. However, the global drop in energy prices is probably the biggest factor in easing the hit on wallets - something that the prime minister has no control over.However, the fall in inflation to 2.3% on 22 May this year ‚Äì the lowest it has been in nearly three years ‚Äì was likely one of the key factors in persuading Sunak to call a snap election many weeks earlier than experts had predicted.Can we expect more handouts or tax breaks to help balance family budgets? Not according to Sunak, who has warned voters that it‚Äôs time to ‚Äúmove on‚Äù from government support.Sunak on... pensionsThe triple-lock pensions policy is a tricky one for Sunak ‚Äì especially since Labour has committed to retaining the policy. Any change to a policy that has become a hallmark of recent Conservative governments would not go down well with the 12 million pensioners it would likely impact ‚Äì many of whom are lifelong Tory voters.Last November, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said pensions should start being pegged to an average of inflation and wage growth, which would help reduce state spending over time.Sunak‚Äôs response to that was ambiguous to say the least: ‚ÄúWe are the government that has ‚Ä¶ delivered the triple lock and it is why, right now, pensions are, depending on how you look at it, ¬£800 or ¬£900 bigger than they otherwise would have been.‚Äù He is yet to confirm whether it will appear in the manifesto."
Yahoo News UK,"Who is Richard Tice? Reform‚Äôs former leader turned Farage sidekickThe candidate for Hartlepool has seen his party's popularity swell in recent months, with one poll showing reform ahead of the Conservatives.",[],Andrew Naughtie,Updated 14 June 2024 at 6:45 am¬∑6-min read,14,June,2024,06:45:00,6,"Now that Nigel Farage has taken over as the leader of Reform UK, Richard Tice‚Äôs public profile is fading fast - but the Reform chairman remains involved in the party's operations.So far, the party has only one MP, Conservative defector Lee Anderson. But a recent poll has shown Reform overtaking the Tories, raising the possibility Anderson could hold his seat and even end up with fellow Reformers in the next Parliament.As the candidate for Hartlepool, where he stood as the Brexit Party candidate in 2019, Tice hopes to be one of them. So who is he, and what does he stand for?Childhood and educationBorn in Surrey in 1964 to James Tice, a showjumper, and Joan Tice, a horse trainer. Educated at the private boarding school Uppingham, he studied at the University of Salford, gaining a degree in construction economics and quantity surveying ‚Äì teeing him up for a career that he said would ""continue the family genes in the property industry"".Family (partner & kids)Tice has three children from a 24-year marriage that ended in divorce. He is now in a long-term relationship with the right-wing writer and journalist Isabel Oakeshott.She is perhaps best known for two notorious incidents that set her against leading Tories: a book that featured the heavily disputed allegation that David Cameron had engaged in sexual activity with a pig, and the release of embarrassing messages entrusted to her by Matt Hancock when she agreed to write a book with him.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election? Full list mappedThe key issues that will decide the electionWhen is the first UK general election TV debate?What is purdah? The strict rule that governs what politicians can and can't sayNet worthWhile not quite in the same league as Rishi Sunak, Tice is one of the wealthiest people in British politics. As he describes it on his website, he made his multi-million-pound fortune over the course of ‚Äú30 years of making things happen in property investment‚Äù, starting with a graduate job at a London firm in 1987.According to Tice, the company he leads as CEO, Quidnet Capital, has ‚Äúbought and managed ¬£500 million in commercial properties across the UK on behalf of clients‚Äù.He was also a key figure in the redevelopment of London‚Äôs Nine Elms district, near Battersea Power Station, a controversial project that has transformed a stretch of the Thames‚Äôs south bank with a welter of rapidly erected high-rise blocks.GB News linksAlong with Nigel Farage, Lee Anderson and several MPs on the right flank of the Tory party, Tice is a regular on the hard-right, culture war-focused TV outlet GB News. There he hosts a programme called ‚ÄúRichard Tice‚Äôs Sunday Sermon‚Äù, which serves as a platform for him to deliver his political analysis without the interruptions of an interviewer.However, despite the network being a relatively safe space for him in ideological terms, Tice‚Äôs appearances aren‚Äôt always amicable. A recent interview with host Andrew Pierce, a longtime right-wing commentator, saw him challenged fiercely about Reform‚Äôs chances in a summer election should one be called ‚Äì with Pierce pointing to the ‚Äúweirdos‚Äù selected by the party to fight numerous seats as evidence the party is ‚Äúnot ready‚Äù.Richard Tice, pictured in 2018 at a 'Leave Means Leave' campaign event, is focused on the issue of immigration. (Steve Finn/WENN)Tice was also involved in an incident that saw the network deemed in breach of broadcasting regulator Ofcom‚Äôs impartiality regulations, specifically an interview in which a former Brexit Party MEP failed to ‚Äúsufficiently challenge‚Äù his views on immigration.The regulator is under increasing pressure to crack down on GB News heading into the election, with critics arguing it cannot be allowed to broadcast shows that feature Tory and Reform MPs interviewing each other without alternative points of view represented.Tice on NHSThe state and future of the NHS set to be one of this election‚Äôs main battlegrounds, and Reform‚Äôs key health policy is to spend ¬£17 billion on the NHS on top of its current budget in an effort to get waiting lists down to zero. It also proposes introducing tax relief on private healthcare ‚Äì something that has been criticised by opponents as a creeping step towards the privatisation of healthcare writ large.Tice‚Äôs stated rationale is that the reason the service is struggling is because the money it needs is being spent on other things that the public do not in fact support. Top of the list is Net Zero, which the party and its predecessors have long decried as a pointless ‚Äúwoke‚Äù project.In April, Tice used a press conference to frame the choice starkly. ‚ÄúWe have a choice in this country, it seems to me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA pretty clear choice. Do we want zero waiting lists in two years, and to keep them there? That is the Reform choice. Or do we want net zero CO2 emissions in 25 years? That is the Labour choice.‚ÄùTice on immigrationImmigration is by far Reform UK‚Äôs top issue, with the party looking to build on Farage‚Äôs two decades of campaigning against it in its legal and illegal forms.As far as the election goes, Tice and the party are targeting the continuing arrival of small boats of people travelling across the English Channel, many of them seeking asylum. He has criticised the government for failing to stop ‚Äúmass immigration‚Äù post-Brexit, and described Rishi Sunak‚Äôs Rwanda policy as ‚Äúa disaster‚Äù, arguing on GB News that its supposed deterrent value was revealed to be zero just hours after the House of Commons finally passed the law.Reform chairman Richard Tice (L) and leader Nigel Farage speak at the party's economic policy launch at Church House in London. (Alamy Live News)‚ÄúWithin a matter of hours more boats, absolutely packed full, overfilled with illegal migrants, were setting off from the beaches. And we learnt on Tuesday morning that sadly five people, including a young child, drowned leaving the beaches. That's not a deterrent. That's an absolute disaster.‚ÄùInstead of deporting people to Rwanda, he is arguing for a ‚Äúpick up and take back‚Äù policy that would see small boat arrivals deposited back on French soil. As evidence that this is both practical and humane, he has cited similar policies deployed in the US and Australia.However, he has not addressed the fact that Australia‚Äôs policy has been criticised internationally for leaving so-called ‚Äúboat people‚Äù confined to facilities on the island of Nauru, where there have been incidents of suicide and self-immolation.Tice on cost of living crisisPerhaps unsurprisingly given he is trying to peel away former Tory voters, Tice has criticised recent Tory prime ministers harshly for overseeing Britain‚Äôs intense cost of living crisis. In 2022, he accused then-prime minister Boris Johnson of ‚Äúwaffling‚Äù over the situation. ‚ÄúClueless, out of touch, no ideas, no help,‚Äù he tweeted. ‚ÄúShocking.‚ÄùHe has also warned that the prospect of a ‚Äúdisastrous‚Äù Labour government will offer no prospect of meaningful relief for struggling households.Instead, Reform proposes lifting the minimum level of income tax to ¬£20,000 while cutting various other taxes ‚Äì among them fuel duty, another gesture to the party‚Äôs rejection of environmentalism as a top priority."

Many also assume his title is hereditary.Here's what you need to know about the personal life of the man who wants to be the UK‚Äôs next prime minister.His early lifeStarmer was born in Southwark, south London, in 1962, as the second of four children. His parents were Labour Party members and named him after Keir Hardie, the party‚Äôs first leader in parliament.The family moved out of the capital and he grew up in Hurst Green, a village just outside the small Surrey town of Oxted. He was active in youth politics from his teenage years but was also a skilled musician, taking music lessons alongside Norman Cook, who later became better known as a member of The Housemartins and the DJ Fatboy Slim.Starmer played the flute, piano, violin and recorder and was a junior exhibitioner at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.His familyStarmer with his wife, Lady Victoria Starmer, at the Labour Party Conference in October 2023. (Alamy)Starmer is married to Victoria, a former solicitor who later retrained in occupational health and now works for the NHS. The pair met through their work in the law in the early 2000s and married in Essex in 2007.She was first seen accompanying her husband when the couple were filmed clapping for carers during the pandemic in 2020 outside their home in Camden. They have two children, a son and daughter, but both are kept out of the public eye.Victoria's father was Jewish and originally came from Poland, while her mother converted when they got married. Starmer has said in a previous interview that ""my wife in particular wants our children to know the faith of her family"" and that they ""observe some of the practices, for example Friday night prayers"".His parentsKeir Starmer with parents, Rodney and Josephine, at his graduation. (Twitter/Keir Starmer)The Labour leader's father, Rodney Starmer, worked as a toolmaker in a factory, and his mother Josephine Starmer (n√©e Baker), was a nurse.His father worked 14-hour days but spent his time outside work caring for Josephine, who was diagnosed with the autoimmune condition Still‚Äôs disease. She required two hip and knee replacements twice in her lifetime and struggled with arthritic pain.As a young man Starmer also helped care for his mother, which he has said led to him being more emotionally reserved. His sister, Katy, recalled: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs had to be a grown-up all his life. I‚Äôve always been quite open about my feelings ‚Äì Keir is good at most things, but not that.‚Äù Josephine Starmer died in 2015, and his father three years later.His educationA photograph of a younger Starmer as shown on ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories in 2021. (ITV)Starmer passed the 11-plus examination, and attended Reigate Grammar School from age 11. While he was at the school it became an independent fee-paying institution, but as an existing student he was exempt from fees, and his tuition in the sixth form was covered by a bursary.After school he studied law at the University of Leeds, this first in his family to attend university, graduating with a first class degree in 1985. He undertook postgraduate law studied at the University of Oxford, where he served as editor of a radical magazine, Socialist Alternatives.Why is he a Sir?Keir Starmer pictured in 2010, when he was director of public prosecutions, making a statement about MPs who face charges over their expenses claims.

In 2008 he was appointed head of the Crown Prosecution Service and DPP.During his tenure he chose to prosecute three Labour MPs and a Conservative in the wake of the parliamentary expenses scandal, and was responsible for prosecuting former MP Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce for perverting the course of justice after Pryce claimed responsibility for her former husband‚Äôs speeding offence."

The Telegraph,Voters should not be fooled by Starmer‚Äôs hollow words,[],Ben Wallace,3 July 2024 at 3:20 am¬∑4-min read,3,July,2024,03:20:00,4,"You wouldn‚Äôt be human if, after 14 years, your hand this week didn‚Äôt pause before ticking the Conservative box on the ballot paper.14 years is a long time for anyone to be in power. Add to that the near-daily scream of social media and voters could be forgiven for choosing anyone but my Party.The ‚Äúchange‚Äù message is always a powerful message when delivered at the correct moment. But let‚Äôs be honest. Acting to ‚Äúchange‚Äù something because the media chorus and Labour says we should is not just a shallow reason, it is also foolhardy.Imagine if we conducted the rest of our lives that way? Imagine if we popped down to our local village shop and declared: ‚ÄúI know you have always been there, and I know you do your best, and I know we have been through tough times together, but I have decided to go and shop for the next five years at the store 10 miles away.‚Äù Or if we did the same to our dentist or butcher or pub. Worse still, imagine if business owners closed down, making everyone redundant, because they felt like it.The reality is that Labour‚Äôs ‚Äúchange‚Äù slogan is as shallow as it is hollow. It‚Äôs what lazy political parties use when they don‚Äôt want you to look in depth at their offerings. It‚Äôs the throw away slogan. The ‚Äúnothing to see here‚Äù distraction.It‚Äôs no wonder the pub bore of a man Nigel Farage has appeared on the scene at this very moment. Perfectly on cue, just like Private Walker from Dad‚Äôs Army offering nylons from the back of a van.But I urge you to resist the social media battle cry of change.¬†Because behind those hollow words is a Labour Party without a plan. A Labour Party which uses slogans as a substitute for substance. Take, for example, their pledge to not tax¬†‚Äúworking people‚Äù. What that really appears to mean is that they will tax business and wealth creation. They are still the party of Gordon Brown, the one which thought we were all idiots and wouldn‚Äôt notice the tax raid on pensions dividends.The deception at the heart of these slogans is that these working people are the very same individuals who suffer the consequences of their employers being taxed more or relocating abroad. I read recently that the Labour candidate in Leeds North East has said his party will ban aerospace sales to the Middle East. If we do, we can kiss goodbye to tens of thousands of jobs and a defence industry that pays the tax he will need for the NHS.We should not forget the enormity of what this country has been through. I remember sitting in a COBR meeting during the early days of the pandemic, when we really were worried that the NHS could collapse and the scale of deaths would be so huge that we would struggle to deal with the bodies.¬†The whole international community were in the same boat. The rest of the West, like us, did what we could based on what we knew.The furlough scheme, Eat Out to Help Out programme, and the world-beating vaccine roll out understandably cost billions. We were at war with the virus and wars are expensive. Estimates suggest that, not only did the UK spend over ¬£400bn fighting Covid but, to this day, the effects of the pandemic are still costing the NHS an extra ¬£5bn per annum at least.Before Covid was Brexit, and after it came Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. Soaring energy costs drove up inflation, which of course impacted interest rates and mortgages ‚Äì mine included. These events happened to us in the UK as well as our friends in Europe. They weren‚Äôt the result of a bad decision in Downing Street ‚Äì as Labour would try and persuade you they were. Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt have steadied the ship and our economy is starting to grow. Inflation has dropped to the 2 per cent target and I predict that, within weeks, interest rates will be cut.There are some enduring truths in politics. In 1979 and 2010, Labour left the economy and country in a worse state than when they found it. Brown tripled the national debt, having inherited a balanced budget, and he didn‚Äôt have a coronavirus or a Russian invasion to contend with.The reality is that Labour always runs out of other people‚Äôs money and fails to understand that without wealth creation there can be no growth.¬†Change can only happen when the word is associated with someone who embodies change which, to be fair to New Labour, Tony Blair did. This time round Change plus Starmer is just a¬† ploy and a cheap slogan. On Thursday, don‚Äôt vote for change for change‚Äôs sake.¬†Vote for the Party that has actually had the respect for the voter and set out a plan.Rt Hon Ben Wallace is a former secretary of state for defence"

If YouGov's predictions are accurate, Labour winning a 194-seat majority would be the highest number since Conservative Stanley Baldwin won a majority of 208 in 1924.The model suggests the Conservatives could be set for near wipeout across many areas of the country, including London, the North East, the North West, and Wales.It also projects that the Scottish National Party would lose more than half their seats, with Labour returning as the largest party north of the border, and the Liberal Democrats reclaiming its place as the third party of British politics ‚Äì winning 48 seats.The new figures, released yesterday, came as Reform UK co-founder Nigel Farage announced that he would be returning as the populist party's leader and would stand for election in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. Even before Farage's latest bid, pollsters told Yahoo News that Reform UK could pose a serious threat to the Tories by splitting the vote and potentially handing even more seats to Labour.The YouGov projection follows a similar poll by modelling site Electoral Calculus, which came out on 31 May. The polling also compares the 2019 result with Electoral Calculus' projection.It predicts that Labour is on course to win an even bigger majority of 319 seats - with Starmer's party picking up 485 MPs and the Tories way behind with 66. The modelling shows the Lib Dems getting very close to the Conservative Party, with 59 seats.While Electoral Calculus' polling, based on opinion polls from 8 May to 20 May, returns a different set of projections to YouGov's, both clearly indicate the scale of the problem facing Sunak.The Electoral Calculus model has predicted Sir Keir Starmer's Labour will win a massive majority.

Yahoo News UK,"Will Nigel Farage's Reform UK 'beat' the Tories in the election?With some polling figures putting the Tories and Reform UK nearly neck and neck, could Farage's party really end up with nearly as many MPs as Sunak's?","['What do the latest polls say?', 'Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?', 'Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?', 'What is proportional representation?']",James Cheng-Morris and  Ellen Manning,Updated 14 June 2024 at 6:33 am¬∑7-min read,14,June,2024,06:33:00,7,"Leading pollster John Curtice has poured cold water on suggestions that Reform UK is now beating the Conservative Party in the general election polls.As representatives from seven parties took prepared to take part in a TV debate on Thursday, a YouGov survey for The Times newspaper said Reform‚Äôs support had increased by two points to 19%, putting them ahead of the Tories for the first time.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage took the the opportunity to hail the poll results in the debate, declaring: ‚ÄúWe are now the opposition to Labour.‚ÄùBut Curtice urged caution, insisting that single polls should not be relied on. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""This is one poll - we‚Äôve actually, I think, had four other polls published in the last 24 hours - none of which have had Reform ahead, not even all of which have had Reform gaining ground, but quite a couple of them certainly suggesting it‚Äôs also got very close.""He said it may not be the case that Reform are ahead - and could be on average four or five points behind. But he said: ""This is still bad news for the Conservatives. The only way Rishi Sunak can hope to get even to base camp in narrowing the lead that Labour have started off with this campaign was to squeeze the Reform vote.""He added: ""Rather than making progress, things are actually going backwards, not least of course because of Nigel Farage‚Äôs decision to fight this campaign.""With many speculating that Reform UK with Farage at the helm could ""beat"" the Tories, Yahoo News UK takes a look.What do the latest polls say?YouGov‚Äôs voting intention tracker, updated on Tuesday, suggests the Tories and Reform UK are neck and neck.With Labour well ahead on 38%, the Tories are trailing on 18% ‚Äì compared to a high of 53% under Boris Johnson in 2020 ‚Äì with Reform UK just behind on 17% and the Liberal Democrats on 15%.However, there are multiple polls taking place at any one time by a number of different companies.According to the PA news agency, an average of all polls that were carried out wholly or partly during the seven days to June 13 puts Labour on 43%, 21 points ahead of the Conservatives on 22%, followed by Reform on 14%, the Lib Dems on 10% and the Greens on 6%.And while Reform‚Äôs average is up one percentage point on the figure for the previous week and the Tories are down one point, there is still an eight-point gap, on average, between the two.Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?Unless something remarkable happens, in short: 'No' - and that's because of the first past the post (FPTP) voting system in which the candidate with the largest number of votes in their constituency is elected.According to the Electoral Reform Society, which is against FPTP, this system leads to a situation where ‚Äúeven if millions of voters support the same party, if they are thinly spread out across the UK they may only get the largest number of votes in a couple of these contests ‚Äì so only win a few MPs"".‚ÄúTens of thousands of voters supporting a different party, but who live near each other, could end up with more MPs. This means the number of MPs a party has in parliament rarely matches their popularity with the public.‚ÄùRishi Sunak on the campaign trail on Wednesday. (AFP via Getty Images)Farage knows this well. As the leader of UKIP in the 2015 election, he saw his party win 12.6% of the nationwide vote and one seat. The Liberal Democrats won 7.9% of the vote... and eight seats.Indeed, YouGov last week released a poll ‚Äì put together using the multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) surveying technique, from a sample size of nearly 60,000 respondents ‚Äì which suggested the Tories would win just 140 seats, having won 365 in 2019. But this is still 140 more than the zero it projected Reform UK to win, in spite of its strong polling figures.The model had Reform UK ""performing strongly in a number of seats but still a long way off winning in any"", with projected second-placed finishes in 27 constituencies.YouGov's MRP projection. (YouGov)Granted, this model was formed between 24 May and 1 June, before Farage's headline-grabbing intervention on Monday last week in which he announced he would be standing as an MP.But, even as Reform UK polls closer than ever to the Tories, it's difficult to imagine the party winning more than a handful of seats.Chris Hopkins, director at polling firm Savanta, told Yahoo News UK that in one respect, Reform UK is at an advantage compared to Ukip in 2015 because ""Ukip took votes from both Labour and the Conservatives, and we are not seeing that with Reform UK ‚Äì they are all coming from the Conservatives.""That is the consequence of Rishi Sunak making immigration a centrepiece of the campaign and failing to deliver on it. Even if you have voters that are neutral on immigration, they would say the small boats policy has been a disaster.""But even so, Hopkins said, Reform UK is still ""at a huge electoral disadvantage"" in that its votes are not very concentrated, they are very evenly spread.""There are going to be some races where Reform UK is strong - the Nigel Farage factor in Clacton is really interesting - but realistically its ceiling is five seats: and that‚Äôs a high ceiling.""Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey on a campaign visit in Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire, on Wednesday. (PA)Like Reform UK, Sir Ed Davey‚Äôs Liberal Democrats are performing well in the polls.In a sign of how defensive the Tory campaign is becoming, one online party advert claims voting for Reform UK or the Lib Dems could give Labour 100 extra seats, resulting in the biggest majority in its history.It depicts a scenario where the Conservatives are beaten into third place behind the Lib Dems, with just 57 seats, despite getting 19% of the vote and without Reform winning a single seat.Read more: Pollsters got it wrong in 2015, so could Labour‚Äôs lead be overestimated? (The Guardian)However, it remains unlikely the Lib Dems will finish second. YouGov‚Äôs MRP poll projected the party performing strongly, winning 48 seats. This would be up 37 from 2019, but still nowhere near the Tories‚Äô projected 140.However, amid all this talk about projections, it‚Äôs worth remembering they are still only polls and not a definite indicator of how people will vote on 4 July. The 1992 and 2015 elections are notable examples of how polling didn‚Äôt match the end results of Tory wins.What is proportional representation?Proportional representation, as defined by the UK parliament, is an electoral system ""in which the distribution of seats corresponds closely with the proportion of the total votes cast for each party. For example, if a party gained 40% of the total votes, a perfectly proportional system would allow them to gain 40% of the seats.""This differs from the first past the post system, as set out above, in that a relatively high vote share rarely corresponds with increased seats for the smaller parties. In 2019, for example, the Lib Dems won 11.5% of the vote but only 1.7% ‚Äì 11 ‚Äì of the 650 seats.Unsurprisingly, both Reform UK and the Lib Dems support proportional representation.The Lib Dems this week made it part of their manifesto, with the party saying it would introduce the single transferrable vote method, a form of proportional representation which allows electors to rank their preference of candidates on the ballot.The party previously sought to change the UK‚Äôs voting system while in the coalition government under then-leader Nick Clegg, but voters rejected the plan in a 2011 referendum.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?
