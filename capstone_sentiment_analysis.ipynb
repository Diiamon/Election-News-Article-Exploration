In that period 3.85m people applied to register in this period cmpared to 2.90m this time.Over 630,000 people applied to register to vote yesterday alone (18 June), as the deadline approached at midnight. This is the second-highest number on record, broken only on the 26 November 2019, when 660,000 people registered in one day.The latest figure of people on the parliamentary electoral register in the UK is 46,652,520, but it has not been updated since December 2023.Gen-Z not showing up?There has been much discussion over young voters not being democratically involved \\u2014 with an exclusive Independent poll showing that a third of young people do not plan to vote.In fact, registration application among the youngest group of voters (18-25) is at just half of the 2019 equivalent period; with just 746,000 Gen-Z voters registering to vote since the election was called this year, compared to 1.4 million in the lead-up to the 2019 general election.It is also worth noting that a large chunk of the current under-25s group were not of voting age at the last general election. Therefore, a substantial portion of Gen-Z voters will not be registered to vote in this election, compared to other age groups.Nonetheless, people aged 35 and under were flocking to register to vote at the final hour, more than any other age group. Over half (55 per cent) of all registrations yesterday were in the 18-34 age group, and 164,000 of these were people aged 25 and under.People aged 25-34 have been the most keen to register overall, with 896,825 registrations since 22 May alone.Though the registration deadline has passed, applications for postal vote are still open until today (19 June) at 5pm.Voters in the July 4 general election will also need a valid form of photo ID, including a passport, driving licence, or blue badge.\",\n          \"ANAS Sarwar has sent a message to voters in Scotland they have one week left to \\u201cget rid of the Tories\\u201d.With seven days until the polling stations open for the General Election the Scottish Labour leader is urging people to vote Labour to ensure Keir Starmer replaces Rishi Sunak as Prime Minister.Sarwar is pushing the Labour message of a new deal for working people and a publicly owned GB Energy firm.Starmer and Labour are well ahead of the Sunak and the Conservatives in opinion polls with the party seemingly on course for a very large majority.The Scottish party leader is looking to take Labour back to having the most Scottish MPs, currently having only two Ian Murray and Michael Shanks.Polls suggest it could even take back all the Glasgow seats, that the SNP has dominated at Westminster since 2015.Sarwar said: \\u201cWith only a week left of this election it is clear that only a vote for Scottish Labour can get rid of the Tories and deliver the change Scotland needs.\\u201cScotland cannot afford any more years of Tory chaos and sleaze.\\u201cIt\\u2019s time for a decade of national renewal with a Labour government with Scotland at its heart.\\u201cA Labour government will boost wages, bring down bills, deliver jobs and help save our NHS.\\u201cScots have a choice -

In that period 3.85m people applied to register in this period cmpared to 2.90m this time.Over 630,000 people applied to register to vote yesterday alone (18 June), as the deadline approached at midnight. This is the second-highest number on record, broken only on the 26 November 2019, when 660,000 people registered in one day.The latest figure of people on the parliamentary electoral register in the UK is 46,652,520, but it has not been updated since December 2023.Gen-Z not showing up?There has been much discussion over young voters not being democratically involved \\u2014 with an exclusive Independent poll showing that a third of young people do not plan to vote.In fact, registration application among the youngest group of voters (18-25) is at just half of the 2019 equivalent period; with just 746,000 Gen-Z voters registering to vote since the election was called this year, compared to 1.4 million in the lead-up to the 2019 general election.It is also worth noting that a large chunk of the current under-25s group were not of voting age at the last general election. Therefore, a substantial portion of Gen-Z voters will not be registered to vote in this election, compared to other age groups.Nonetheless, people aged 35 and under were flocking to register to vote at the final hour, more than any other age group. Over half (55 per cent) of all registrations yesterday were in the 18-34 age group, and 164,000 of these were people aged 25 and under.People aged 25-34 have been the most keen to register overall, with 896,825 registrations since 22 May alone.Though the registration deadline has passed, applications for postal vote are still open until today (19 June) at 5pm.Voters in the July 4 general election will also need a valid form of photo ID, including a passport, driving licence, or blue badge.\",\n          \"ANAS Sarwar has sent a message to voters in Scotland they have one week left to \\u201cget rid of the Tories\\u201d.With seven days until the polling stations open for the General Election the Scottish Labour leader is urging people to vote Labour to ensure Keir Starmer replaces Rishi Sunak as Prime Minister.Sarwar is pushing the Labour message of a new deal for working people and a publicly owned GB Energy firm.Starmer and Labour are well ahead of the Sunak and the

his party want to update entitlements \\u201cfor the 21st century\\u201d.He said: \\u201cThis community is wrestling with some of the highest levels of fuel poverty in our country, it is literally unbearable for people, despite the fact that this community is producing vast amounts of renewable energy.\\\"\\u201cAt the heart of our manifesto will be that commitment, that we will argue for a social tariff funded by general taxation and by the power companies which will reduce the costs for those who are vulnerable in our society and give them a material contribution to reducing the cost of living.\\u201cToday, none of us really can operate without connectivity, access to broadband, access to telecoms, so many public services are delivered by that mechanism as well.\\u201cSo we\\u2019re going to propose that the social tariff extends also to broadband and telecoms costs, so that people are liberated of the excessive burden and they\\u2019re able to access public services and their wider communication in society, because they have got a tariff that is appropriate for meeting their circumstances.\\u201dREAD NEXT:\\u00a0Glasgow West: Partick to Drumchapel the battle for

but the way to do that is not to make hardworking Scots pay more and hammer the North Sea oil and gas industry, which would put jobs at risk.\\u201cThis proposal for a half-priced tariff is a half-baked idea that might sound good on paper but, in reality, it would just see Scots paying even more in tax and do huge damage to our economy.\\u201dIt comes after the Scottish Liberal Democrats launched their manifesto today.The party's manifesto\\u00a0included\\u00a0plans to introduce a carer\\u2019s minimum wage with a \\u00a32 an hour boost, as well as\\u00a0fast-tracking access to

That\\u2019s the choice at this election.\\u201dMr Harper told the same programme it it not \\u201cwise\\u201d to regard the election result as a foregone conclusion.But, he continued: \\u201cThe polls do tell us one thing \\u2013 they do show people that if people don\\u2019t vote Conservative and some of the smaller people vote for the smaller parties and Labour does end up with a very large majority, they\\u2019re going to have a blank cheque, they\\u2019re trying very hard in this campaign not to spell out how they\\u2019re going to pay for any of their promises.\\u201dTransport Secretary Mark Harper said the Conservatives are \\u2018fighting for every vote\\u2019 (Victoria Jones/PA)The Transport Secretary went on to repeat the much-disputed Tory claim that a Labour government would increase taxes by \\u00a32,000, as the bitter clash over tax and spending plans continues.The Conservatives have produced a list of 17 potential tax increases Labour could make, but Sir Keir\\u2019s party said it would refuse to be drawn into the Tory trap of responding to each claim.Mr Streeting declined to rule out council tax rises or re-evaluations.When pressed on this on the BBC\\u2019s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg, he evaded the question and repeated the party\\u2019s line: \\u201cWe don\\u2019t want to see the tax burden on working people increase.\\u201cNone of those pledges in our manifesto requires increases in council tax or increases in fuel duty or any of the other number of taxes the Tories are claiming we want to increase.\\u201dMr Streeting suggested there could be greater spending increases for the NHS than committed to in the Labour manifesto, saying this could happen \\u201conly if the conditions allow\\u201d.The Conservatives seized on this, with a party spokesman saying: \\u201cLabour\\u2019s manifesto is just window dressing for the election campaign and they are planning to spend and tax more than they are telling the public.\\u201d(PA Graphics)It followed analysis by the Nuffield Trust think tank that suggested both Labour and Tory pledges on the NHS would leave the health service with lower annual funding increases \\u2013 at 1.1% and 0.9% respectively \\u2013 than during the austerity era.Scotland\\u2019s First Minister John Swinney said: \\u201cScotland has already suffered the consequences of 14 years of Tory cuts, Brexit, and a cost-of-living crisis \\u2013 the last thing our NHS needs now is even more cuts, Brexit and creeping privatisation imposed by Sir Keir Starmer\\u2019s incoming Westminster government.\\u201cIndependent experts are clear the Labour Party is planning around \\u00a318 billion of cuts to public services \\u2013 and will starve the NHS of the cash it needs to improve health and care services.\\u201d\",\n          \"Reform UK insists its plans are \\u201cnot just another party manifesto\\u201d, because it does not expect to win the election. But there are a lot of policy ideas in its 28-page \\u201ccontract\\u201d with the electorate. Here are the main proposals from Nigel Farage\\u2019s party.Economy and taxation\\u2022 In short: Liz Truss on steroids. There would be cuts to personal tax worth \\u00a370bn a year, including scrapping income tax below \\u00a320,000, and big cuts to stamp duty and inheritance tax. Cuts to business levies including corporation tax would cost \\u00a318bn a year.\\u2022 Reform says this would be paid for by scrapping plans to reach net zero carbon emissions (more on that below), plus \\u00a350bn a year from cutting government departments and quangos, and \\u00a335bn from the technical process of making the Bank of England stop paying interest on commercial bank deposits created through quantitative easing.\\u2022 All this could be filed under \\u201cfiscally bold\\u201d. The Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank termed the package \\u201cproblematic\\u201d, saying: \\u201cEven with the extremely optimistic assumptions about how much economic growth would increase, the sums in this manifesto do not add up.\\u201dImmigration\\u2022 There is only so much room to the right of the Conservatives on this subject, but Reform would use most of it, pledging a freeze on \\u201cnon-essential\\u201d immigration, with only a handful of exceptions, and higher national insurance imposed on overseas workers.\\u2022 On asylum seekers, Reform would take Britain out of the European convention on human rights (ECHR), process people offshore and \\u201cpick up illegal migrants out of boats and take them back to France\\u201d.\\u2022 On small boat crossings, there would be significant doubts about whether, even outside the ECHR, the UK could actually return asylum seekers to France. And a freeze on immigration, even with limited exceptions for the NHS, could have a significant impact on the social care and hospitality sectors.Environment and energy\\u2022 A major part of Reform\\u2019s offer is to roll back green targets, including to scrap net zero goals altogether, which the party says would save \\u00a330bn a year over 25 years. The International Energy Agency estimated that the UK spent less than \\u00a39bn a year between 2021 and 2023 on low-carbon energy policy. This is less than comparable developed countries, and, according to an LSE study, higher green investment is likely to lower household bills and boost growth more than tax cuts.\\u2022 The manifesto says net zero has increased bills, damaged industries such as steelmaking, and made the UK less energy secure. However, evidence from the IMF shows energy bills have risen because of the UK\\u2019s heavy reliance on imported gas.\\u2022 In terms of threats to security, the World Economic Forum put extreme weather as the leading global risk to security in 2024.Healthcare\\u2022 As part of the tax cuts, frontline NHS and social care staff would pay zero basic-rate tax for three years, with the aim of boosting staff numbers. There would also be 20% tax relief on private health insurance.\\u2022 While Farage has called for a move away from the current NHS funding system towards one that also uses social insurance, this idea is not set out in the document. It is fair to say that the health and care plans as they stand are fairly broad.Policing and crime\\u2022 As well as promising 40,000 more police officers, the party has pledged mass stop and search, and the end of what it terms \\u201cwoke policing\\u201d.\\u2022 The sentencing regime would be significantly toughened, with mandatory life sentences for anyone convicted of drug dealing, or a second violent or serious offence. And 10,000 new prisons places would be built.\\u2022 Given that about 10,000 people a year are convicted for drug dealing alone, such policies would need a lot more prison places. Also, there is limited evidence that non-intelligence-led stop and search is effective in curbing crime \\u2013 or that police forces would want to use it.Education\\u2022 This section is low on specifics and seems to be led more by culture war issues, with the first two points calling for a \\u201cpatriotic curriculum\\u201d and an end to \\u201ctransgender ideology\\u201d in schools. There would be another tax cut, this one offering tax relief on private school fees.\\u2022 On universities, as well as scrapping interest on student loans \\u2013 this does not seem to appear in the costings section \\u2013 the party would push for two-year degrees, and cut funding to universities it felt were denying free speech.Housing and transport\\u2022 On housing, Reform says it wants to \\u201cunleash\\u201d housebuilding, but the party would also protect landlords, scrapping plans to ban no-fault evictions or other renting changes.\\u2022 On transport, the party would end the \\u201cwar on drivers\\u201d, unilaterally scrapping any clean air zones, low-traffic neighbourhoods and almost all 20mph zones.\\u2022 These sorts of policies give a flavour of the type of voter Reform wants to attract: older people who are more likely to be homeowners and drivers.Other policies\\u2022 Social security: \\u201cmotivate\\u201d people to work, and withdraw all benefits if they turn down two job offers.\\u2022 Brexit: abandon the Windsor framework, which sought to find a compromise over EU trade and not having a hard Irish border.\\u2022 Constitution and voting: replace the Lords with an elected second chamber; move towards a proportional voting system.\\u2022 Culture: scrap the BBC licence fee and the Equality Act; make St George\\u2019s and St David\\u2019s days public holidays.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":

He told Radio 4's Today programme: \\\"This is one poll - we\\u2019ve actually, I think, had four other polls published in the last 24 hours - none of which have had Reform ahead, not even all of which have had Reform gaining ground, but quite a couple of them certainly suggesting it\\u2019s also got very close.\\\"He said it may not be the case that Reform are ahead - and could be on average four or five points behind. But he said: \\\"This is still bad news for the Conservatives. The only way Rishi Sunak can hope to get even to base camp in narrowing the lead that Labour have started off with this campaign was to squeeze the Reform vote.\\\"He added: \\\"Rather than making progress, things are actually going backwards, not least of course because of Nigel Farage\\u2019s decision to fight this campaign.\\\"With many speculating that Reform UK with Farage at the helm could \\\"beat\\\" the Tories, Yahoo News UK takes a look.What do the latest polls say?YouGov\\u2019s voting intention tracker, updated on Tuesday, suggests the Tories and Reform UK are neck and neck.With Labour well ahead on 38%, the Tories are trailing on 18% \\u2013 compared to a high of 53% under Boris Johnson in 2020 \\u2013 with Reform UK just behind on 17% and the Liberal Democrats on 15%.However, there are multiple polls taking place at any one time by a number of different companies.According to the PA news agency, an average of all polls that were carried out wholly or partly during the seven days to June 13 puts Labour on 43%, 21 points ahead of the Conservatives on 22%, followed by Reform on 14%, the Lib Dems on 10% and the Greens on 6%.And while Reform\\u2019s average is up one percentage point on the figure for the previous week and the Tories are down one point, there is still an eight-point gap, on average, between the two.Could Reform UK get more MPs than the Tories?Unless something remarkable happens, in short: 'No' - and that's because of the first past the post (FPTP) voting system in which the candidate with the largest number of votes in their constituency is elected.According to the Electoral Reform Society, which is against FPTP, this system leads to a situation where \\u201ceven if millions of voters support the same party, if they are thinly spread out across the UK they may only get the largest number of votes in a couple of these contests \\u2013 so only win a few MPs\\\".\\u201cTens of thousands of voters supporting a different party, but who live near each other, could end up with more MPs. This means the number of MPs a party has in parliament rarely matches their popularity with the public.\\u201dRishi Sunak on the campaign trail on Wednesday. (AFP via Getty Images)Farage knows this well. As the leader of UKIP in the 2015 election, he saw his party win 12.6% of the nationwide vote and one seat. The Liberal Democrats won 7.9% of the vote... and eight seats.Indeed, YouGov last week released a poll \\u2013 put together using the multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) surveying technique, from a sample size of nearly 60,000 respondents \\u2013 which suggested the Tories would win just 140 seats, having won 365 in 2019. But this is still 140 more than the zero it projected Reform UK to win, in spite of its strong polling figures.The model had Reform UK \\\"performing strongly in a number of seats but still a long way off winning in any\\\", with projected second-placed finishes in 27 constituencies.YouGov's MRP projection. (YouGov)Granted, this model was formed between 24 May and 1 June, before Farage's headline-grabbing intervention on Monday last week in which he announced he would be standing as an MP.But, even as Reform UK polls closer than ever to the Tories, it's difficult to imagine the party winning more than a handful of seats.Chris Hopkins, director at polling firm Savanta, told Yahoo News UK that in one respect, Reform UK is at an advantage compared to Ukip in 2015 because \\\"Ukip took votes from both Labour and the Conservatives, and we are not seeing that with Reform UK \\u2013 they are all coming from the Conservatives.\\\"That is the consequence of Rishi Sunak making immigration a centrepiece of the campaign and failing to deliver on it. Even if you have voters that are neutral on immigration, they would say the small boats policy has been a disaster.\\\"But even so, Hopkins said, Reform UK is still \\\"at a huge electoral disadvantage\\\" in that its votes are not very concentrated, they are very evenly spread.\\\"There are going to be some races where Reform UK is strong - the Nigel Farage factor in Clacton is really interesting - but realistically its ceiling is five seats: and that\\u2019s a high ceiling.\\\"Could the Lib Dems be the official opposition party?Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey on a campaign visit in Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire, on Wednesday. (PA)Like Reform UK, Sir Ed Davey\\u2019s Liberal Democrats are performing well in the polls.In a sign of how defensive the Tory campaign is becoming, one online party advert claims voting for Reform UK or the Lib Dems could give Labour 100 extra seats, resulting in the biggest majority in its history.It depicts a scenario where the Conservatives are beaten into third place behind the Lib Dems, with just 57 seats, despite getting 19% of the vote and without Reform winning a single seat.Read more: Pollsters got it wrong in 2015, so could Labour\\u2019s lead be overestimated? (The Guardian)However, it remains unlikely the Lib Dems will finish second. YouGov\\u2019s MRP poll projected the party performing strongly, winning 48 seats. This would be up 37 from 2019, but still nowhere near the Tories\\u2019 projected 140.However, amid all this talk about projections, it\\u2019s worth remembering they are still only polls and not a definite indicator of how people will vote on 4 July. The 1992 and 2015 elections are notable examples of how polling didn\\u2019t match the end results of Tory wins.What is proportional representation?Proportional representation, as defined by the UK parliament, is an electoral system \\\"in which the distribution of seats corresponds closely with the proportion of the total votes cast for each party. For example, if a party gained 40% of the total votes, a perfectly proportional system would allow them to gain 40% of the seats.\\\"This differs from the first past the post system, as set out above, in that a relatively high vote share rarely corresponds with increased seats for the smaller parties. In 2019, for example, the Lib Dems won 11.5% of the vote but only 1.7% \\u2013 11 \\u2013 of the 650 seats.Unsurprisingly, both Reform UK and the Lib Dems support proportional representation.The Lib Dems this week made it part of their manifesto, with the party saying it would introduce the single transferrable vote method, a form of proportional representation which allows electors to rank their preference of candidates on the ballot.The party previously sought to change the UK\\u2019s voting system while in the coalition government under then-leader Nick Clegg, but voters rejected the plan in a 2011 referendum.Keir Starmer profile: The toolmakers' son vowing to 'rebuild Britain'Rishi Sunak profile: The PM battling to stay in power of election gambleHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhich MPs are standing down before the next election?

Many also assume his title is hereditary.So what do you really need to know about the man who, on current poll ratings, is set to be the UK\\u2019s next prime minister?His early lifeKeir Starmer was born in Southwark, south London, in 1962, as the second of four children. His parents were Labour Party members and named him after Keir Hardie, the party\\u2019s first leader in parliament.The family moved out of the capital and he grew up in Hurst Green, a village just outside the small Surrey town of Oxted. He was active in youth politics from his teenage years but was also a skilled musician, taking music lessons alongside Norman Cook, who later became better known as a member of The Housemartins and the DJ Fatboy Slim.Starmer played the flute, piano, violin and recorder and was a junior exhibitioner at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.His familyStarmer is married to Victoria, a former solicitor who later retrained in occupational health and now works for the NHS. The pair met through their work in the law in the early 2000s and married in Essex in 2007.She was first seen accompanying her husband when the couple were filmed clapping for carers during the pandemic in 2020 outside their home in Camden. They have two children, a son and daughter, but both are kept out of the public eye.Victoria's father was Jewish and originally came from Poland, while her mother converted when they got married. Starmer has said in a previous interview that \\\"my wife in particular wants our children to know the faith of her family\\\" and that they \\\"observe some of the practices, for example Friday night prayers\\\".Keir Starmer with parents, Rodney and Josephine, at his graduation. (Twitter/Keir Starmer)His parentsThe Labour leader's father, Rodney Starmer, worked as a toolmaker in a factory, and his mother Josephine Starmer (n\\u00e9e Baker), was a nurse.His father worked long, 14-hour days but spent his time outside work caring for Josephine, who was diagnosed with the autoimmune condition Still\\u2019s disease. She required two hip and knee replacements twice in her lifetime and struggled with arthritic pain.As a young man Starmer also helped care for his mother, which he has said led to him being more emotionally reserved. His sister, Katy, recalled: \\u201cHe\\u2019s had to be a grown-up all his life. I\\u2019ve always been quite open about my feelings \\u2013 Keir is good at most things, but not that.\\u201d Josephine Starmer died in 2015, and his father three years later.His educationStarmer passed the 11-plus examination, and attended Reigate Grammar School from age 11. While he was at the school it became an independent fee-paying institution, but as an existing student he was exempt from fees, and his tuition in the sixth form was covered by a bursary.After school he studied law at the University of Leeds, this first in his family to attend university, graduating with a first class degree in 1985. He undertook postgraduate law studied at the University of Oxford, where he served as editor of a radical magazine, Socialist Alternatives.A photograph of a younger Starmer as shown on ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories in 2021. (ITV)Why is he a sir?Stamer was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 2014 in recognition of his work in the legal profession, culminating in a five-year term as Director of Public Prosecutions.He first became a barrister in 1987 at the Middle Temple, later joining Doughty Street Chambers and was appointed a Queen\\u2019s Counsel in 2002, aged just 39. In 2008 he was appointed head of the Crown Prosecution Service and DPP.During his tenure he chose to prosecute three Labour MPs and a Conservative in the wake of the parliamentary expenses scandal, and was responsible for prosecuting former MP Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce for perverting the course of justice after Pryce claimed responsibility for her former husband\\u2019s speeding offence.Starmer on... the NHSThe Labour leader has said that, if elected, his government would \\u201cget the NHS working around the clock and pay staff properly to do it\\u201d.The remark followed a commitment to provide \\u00a31.1bn in funding for the health service to cut waiting lists by paying doctors and nurses to carry out additional out-of-hours care, which would be funded by axing tax breaks for wealthy \\u201cnon-doms\\u201d who hoard money overseas. He added: \\u201cThe Conservative Party that brought our NHS to its knees will put it in the ground. We have to get it back on its feet.\\u201dStarmer describes the NHS as \\u201cthe crowdfunded solution for all of us\\u201d, reinforcing his commitment to healthcare being free at the point of use, but says reform is inevitable or the health service would \\u201cremain on life support\\u201d. He has pledged to integrate up-to-date technology into every part of the NHS including using artificial intelligence to diagnose disease earlier and more accurately.He supported the doctors strikes, telling ministers: \\u201cDon\\u2019t break junior doctors, talk to them. Get in the room [and] sort it out.\\u201dStarmer with his wife, Lady Victoria Starmer, at the Labour Party Conference in October 2023. (Alamy)Starmer on\\u2026 immigrationThe government has \\u201clost control of borders\\u201d, according to Labour. Starmer has said a Labour government would set up a new policy unit to tackle illegal migration and has suggested that a returns agreement for asylum seekers could be negotiated with the European Union to solve the small boats crisis.He described the government\\u2019s thwarted Rwanda plan, which would see illegal migrants deported to the African nation but has to be put into practice due to legal blocks, as a \\u201cgimmick\\u201d and a \\u201cfarce\\u201d and has promised to reverse it.Starmer on... the cost of living crisisStarmer has sought to keep Rishi Sunak\\u2019s handling of the cost of living crisis in the minds of voters by claiming that \\u201chis fingerprints are all over their struggling household budgets\\u201d. In a letter to his shadow cabinet, leaked to The Guardian, he wrote: \\u201cRishi Sunak is the chief architect of choices prioritising the wealthiest and of the government\\u2019s failure to get a grip of the economy and get growth going.\\u201dHe has said he would prioritise tackling inflation, blaming it for putting up prices and eroding household savings, but has pledged to \\u201ctake the difficult and responsible decisions\\u201d to bring it down.Starmer pictured in 2010, when he was director of public prosecution at the CPS, making a statement about MPs who face charges over their expenses claims. (Getty)Starmer on... private schoolsLabour has dropped its early promise to scrap charitable status for private schools, but has committed to levying a 20% VAT rate on school fees removing their \\u201cunfair tax break\\u201d. The money raised, he said, will be used to address the \\u201cappalling state\\u201d of the school system for all children.\\u201cIt\\u2019s not an attack on private schools. It\\u2019s just saying an exemption you have had is going to go,\\u201d he warned private schools who have been critical of the plan \\u2013 reminding them they are not obliged to pass that tax on to parents in the form of increased fees.Starmer on\\u2026 the House of LordsWhen he was first Labour leader, Starmer proposed a \\u201croot and branch reform of the centre of government\\u2026 rooting out unearned privilege and addressing unaccountable power\\u201d.But his promise to scrap the House of Lords within the first four years of a new parliament - a controversial move that caused a split among his party\\u2019s grandees, has been abandoned.Starmer still backs plans for a second chamber \\u201celectoral legitimacy\\u201d, but as his party nears government he has stepped away from the most radical form of that pledge. He is now reportedly committed to cutting the number of hereditary peers, reducing the size of the chamber and introducing a new appointments process.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Article_avg_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Positive\",\n          \"Neutral\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Article_bert_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Neutral\",\n          \"Positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Article_roberta_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Positive\",\n          \"Neutral\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
