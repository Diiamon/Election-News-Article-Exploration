The Guardian,Tokyo election: demographic crisis the top issue as two women vie for job of governor,[],Justin McCurry in Tokyo,20 June 2024 at 0:49 am·3-min read,20,June,2024,00:49:00,3,"The race to become Tokyo’s next governor has kicked off, with two women in the lead to run the world’s most populous city – a rarity in a country where comparatively few women occupy high political office.Millions of voters in Tokyo will elect their governor early next month. The successful candidate’s most urgent job has a more familiar ring, however: to address the capital’s accelerating demographic crisis.The contest between incumbent Yuriko Koike and Renho Murata – who is commonly known by her given name – is being seen as a proxy war between the governing Liberal Democratic party [LDP], which is backing Koike, and the main opposition Constitutional Democratic party [CDP], which is supporting Renho.Related: ‘I decided I could do better than them’: the women taking on Japan’s male-dominated politicsKoike, a conservative who guided the city through the Covid-19 pandemic and the summer Olympics in 2021, is seeking a third term with promises to focus on family-friendly measures. The former defence and environment minister became Tokyo’s first female governor in 2016.Her main challenger is the centre-left Renho, a 56-year-old former swimsuit model who became the first female leader of Japan’s largest opposition party in 2016. She left the CDP to run as an independent, but has the support of her former party and, controversially, the Japanese Communist party [JCP].Koike, 71, was a TV news anchor before she entered politics, winning a seat in the lower house of parliament for the first time in 1993. Renho, too, was a familiar face on TV news programmes before she entered politics as a member of the upper house in 2004.Japan’s low birthrate has quickly emerged as the key issue in the 7 July vote, which will see almost 50 candidates from across the political spectrum competing to lead a megalopolis of 14.1 million people and a GDP that rivals that of the Netherlands.Nationwide, the fertility rate – or the average number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime – stands at 1.2, well below the 2.07 needed to keep the population stable. The situation in Tokyo is even more urgent: at 0.99, its birthrate is the lowest among Japan’s 47 prefectures.“Candidates must offer a blueprint for managing the unprecedented demographic challenges of an ageing and shrinking population in this megacity,” the Asahi Shimbun said in an editorial.The frontrunners have clashed over their plans to lift the birthrate, with Koike promising lower rents for families and free daycare for married couples’ first children.Renho said she would pressure companies to improve their employees’ work-life balance. “I want to make Tokyo a city where young people, regardless of their circumstances, can study, work, get married and have children, and have all these life choices” she said during a recent campaign speech, according to the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper.Both candidates have battled minor scandals. Koike has again been forced to deny allegations, first levelled at her four years ago, that she falsely claimed she had graduated from Cairo University in 1976 with a degree in sociology. The popularity of her backers, the LDP, has also been badly damaged by a funding scandal.Renho – who was born to a Japanese mother and Taiwanese father – sparked a minor controversy when she became opposition leader in 2016 by revealing she still held dual Japanese and Taiwanese nationality, despite insisting earlier that she had become a naturalised Japanese citizen in her teens.Japanese law requires people with dual nationality to choose one or the other before they turn 22. Renho later renounced her Taiwanese citizenship."
PA Media: UK News,"NHS funding pledged by parties ‘well short’ of what is needed, says think tank",[],"Ella Pickover, PA Health Correspondent",20 June 2024 at 1:11 am·4-min read,20,June,2024,01:11:00,4,"NHS funding pledged by leading political parties “falls well short” of what is needed to make improvements in the service, a leading think tank has said.The Health Foundation called on politicians to be honest with the public about the scale of the crisis facing the NHS, and the amount of money needed to address issues.It said that an incoming government will face “difficult choices” – to increase taxes to provide more funding, reduce spending in other departments and services, or see the NHS “do less”.New analysis from the think tank concludes there is a potential £38 billion per year shortfall in the funding needed to improve the NHS by the end of the next parliament.Work by the Health Foundation’s REAL Centre suggests that funding in England will need to rise by an average of 3.8% per year in real terms over the next 10 years to meet rising demand and to deliver improvements across the service.This includes a higher level of growth of 4.5% per year in the first five years.Researchers projected what would happen if the health budget grows in line with the assumed growth in public spending factored into the Office for Budget Responsibility’s economic forecasts for the next parliament – real-terms funding increases of 0.8% per year.This level of growth would see the total Department of Health and Social Care budget increase to £197 billion in 2029/30 – leaving the healthcare system in England around £38 billion a year short of what is needed to drive improvements, experts said.A new Health Foundation report says the money is needed to bring “significant changes” to NHS services, and prioritises spending on GP care, mental health and community services.The analysis includes a 10-year timescale to tackle the backlog of routine hospital appointment – which is slower than Labour and the Conservatives have pledged.Anita Charlesworth, director of the Health Foundation’s REAL Centre, said: “The health service is in crisis and all the main political parties have said they want to fix it – yet the funding they have so far promised falls well short of the level needed to make improvements.“Politicians need to be honest with the public about the scale of the challenge the NHS faces and the reality that an NHS fit for the future needs long-term sustainable investment.In a #GeneralElection we often hear promises to employ more nurses.Jim Buchan explains that ‘more’ nurses at a national level also needs to translate into the ‘right’ number of nurses locally to provide safe care and increase productivity.Read more 👇https://t.co/KK2OJnj8xT pic.twitter.com/tdlwHvIilL— The Health Foundation (@HealthFdn) June 19, 2024“Honesty about this has so far been conspicuously lacking from the General Election debate, with both the main parties unwilling to spell out the difficult choices on public spending and taxation that will confront the next government.“The scenario we have set out is not overly ambitious – it is broadly in line with the pledges set out by the main political parties and public expectations, and assumes the NHS can deliver challenging improvements in productivity.”A Conservative Party spokesman said: “Thanks to our clear plan and bold action, we have virtually eliminated the longest NHS waits and overall waiting lists are falling at the fastest rate in over a decade outside the pandemic.“But there is more to do which is why our £3.4 billion Productivity Plan will transform the NHS with new technology and unlock £35 billion of cumulative savings by the end of the decade.“We will continue to increase NHS funding above inflation across the next Parliament to train and recruit 92,000 more nurses and 28,000 doctors through our Long Term Workforce Plan. We will deliver millions more scans, tests and checks as we cut waiting lists and deliver better care for patients.“Only Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives will take the bold action, backed by a clear plan, to build a brighter and healthier future.“Labour would take the country back to square one with at least £2,094 in higher council tax and other tax rises for every working family.”"

The Telegraph,Tory candidate who allegedly bet on election date ‘married to Conservative Director of Campaigns’,[],Amy Gibbons,20 June 2024 at 2:40 am·2-min read,20,June,2024,02:40:00,2,"A Tory candidate being investigated over an alleged bet on the date of the general election is married to the party’s director of campaigning.Laura Saunders, who is standing in Bristol North West, is the subject of an inquiry by the Gambling Commission, according to the BBC.It has now emerged she is married to Tony Lee, the Conservative Party’s Director of Campaigning.Ms Saunders, the second prospective parliamentary candidate being looked into by the gambling regulator, previously worked at Conservative Party headquarters in central London.Ms Saunders is the subject of an inquiry by the Gambling Commission, according to the BBCThe revelation follows the news that a police officer working in Rishi Sunak’s close protection team has been arrested as part of an investigation into bets placed on the date of the general election.The Metropolitan Police was contacted by the Gambling Commission last Friday and informed that the agency was looking into the activities of a member of Scotland Yard’s Royalty and Specialist Protection command.The police constable, who has not been named, was immediately removed from operational duties.Craig Williams, a senior aide to the Prime Minister, also reportedly bet £100 on the date of the election just before it was called.Mr Williams, who is standing for re-election as MP in Montgomeryshire, bet on the election being held in July three days before the announcement was made, according to The Guardian.The claim has not been disputed by Mr Williams, who admitted he had a “flutter” on the election a few weeks ago. He has since apologised for a “huge error of judgment”.Craig Williams, a senior aide to the Prime Minister, also reportedly bet £100 on the date of the election just before it was called - Matthew Horwood/Getty Images EuropeWith regards to Ms Saunders’ case, a Conservative Party spokesman said last night: “We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals.“As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn’t be proper to comment further, until any process is concluded.”Since the BBC reported on Thursday morning that Ms Saunders is married to Mr Lee, the latter’s LinkedIn page appears to have been taken down. A summary on Google shows he was listed as the party’s Director of Campaigning.The Tories’ Director of Campaigning is separate to their campaigns director, a post held by Isaac Levido, who is responsible for running the general election campaign.Mr Lee is understood to have a more minor role running local campaigns.Asked for comment, a Tory spokesman repeated their statement from Wednesday night."

They faced 90 minutes of questioning from Julie Etchingham, the ITV newsreader who oversaw the first debate on June 4, and a live studio audience in Salford, Manchester.Both ITV and the BBC have hosted debates in an array of formats, giving candidates the opportunity to make a lasting impact on the latest opinion polls.When is the next general election TV debate? The BBC will return to host a Question Time special tonight, with leading members of the UK’s four largest parties: the Conservatives, Labour Party, SNP and Liberal Democrats.Fiona Bruce will lead the broadcast from 8pm to 10pm in York. Sir Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak will be joined by John Swinney and Sir Ed Davey to face questions from members of the public.Another head to head between Sir Keir and the Conservative leader will follow on June 26, before what is expected to be the final programme of the election campaign, another BBC Question Time special featuring Nigel Farage on June 28 – less than a week before the nation goes to the polls.What channel are the debates on?ITV and the BBC have confirmed they will host general election debates over the campaign.The programmes will be available on BBC1, BBC News and ITV1, as well as live on their streaming platforms BBC Iplayer and ITVX.For those watching from Scotland, the ITV debates will be on the equivalent channel STV.ITV also streamed the first debate on June 4 live on their Youtube channel and are expected, along with the BBC, to do the same for the following programmes.The BBC have also confirmed they will air their debates on local radio.Sky’s debate will be available to watch on Freeview and can be streamed online at the Sky News website or on social media.The Telegraph will be providing live coverage of all the debates with expert analysis and reaction.Question Time special - June 20, 8pm on the BBCThe BBC will return tonight to host a Question Time Leader’s special with representatives of the UK’s four largest parties: the Conservatives, Labour Party, SNP and Liberal Democrats.Fiona Bruce will lead the broadcast from 8pm to 10pm in York and speak to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, Rishi Sunak, John Swinney and Sir Ed Davey.During the programme, each leader will be granted a thirty-minute slot to answer audience questions.Sunak and Starmer head to head - June 26, 9pm on the BBCThe BBC will host what is likely to be the 2024 election campaign’s final TV debate on Wednesday June 26 – one week before the country will head to the polls.The programme will be another head to head between Mr Sunak and Mr Starmer only, similar to the ITV debate they took part in on June 4 and hosted by Sophie Raworth, the BBC news presenter.It will kick off at 9pm and run until 10pm.Sir Keir agreed to the two head-to-head discussions only and said he would not speak at the larger debates happening on either channel.Question Time special - June 28, 8pm on the BBCFollowing complaints from the leader of Reform after he was not invited to attend the first Question Time special, the broadcaster has announced a second programme on Friday June 28.The corporation said it has added the second billing to its election coverage to reflect “the fact that it is clear from across a broad range of opinion polls that the support for Reform UK has been growing”.Mr Farage had demanded a spot on Thursday’s programme after an opinion poll put his party ahead of the Conservatives and has said he is “pleased” with the BBC’s recognition of his party’s growing favour.The Question Time special will be hosted by Fiona Bruce from 8pm and the Green Party has also been invited to attend.How many debates will there be before the election?So far, a total of seven debates will be held in the run-up to the general election on July 4, with three left to go following ITV’s seven-way debate on Thursday June 13.The debate announcements were confirmed after the Tories had pressed Sir Keir to take part in a record six debates during the six-week election countdown.Conservative sources had dubbed the opposition leader “the knight that won’t fight” and “Sir Fear Starmer” after he failed to sign up to their weekly debate demand.Labour headquarters indicated instead that their leader would take part in two head-to-head debates against Mr Sunak, matching what Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn did ahead of the 2019 election.Will the debates clash with any football fixtures?There are several clashes between debate timings and football fixtures – an inevitability with the jam-packed TV schedules.Football fans and politics watchers were torn on June 7, when the BBC’s debate with the seven parties coincided with England’s international warm-up with Iceland on Channel 4.England will play Denmark this evening – the same day as the BBC’s Question Time Leaders’ Special – but at an earlier kick-off time of 5pm before the election programme at 8pm.So there is only one BBC clash taking place as the channel managed to avoid competing with the Men’s European Championship fixtures.There are no more ITV football fixture clashes after the broadcaster moved the England Women’s Euros match with France, which had been due to air on ITV1, to ITV4 as it coincided with Mr Sunak and Mr Starmer’s head to head on June 4.When is the general election?The general election will take place on July 4 as the country heads to the polls between 7am and 10pm to have their say over the next prime minister.It was confirmed by Rishi Sunak in a rain-sodden speech outside of Downing Street on May 22 that the election would happen six weeks later. Both the Prime Minister and other party leaders have been on the campaign trail since then in a bid to win over voters through measures such as the TV debates."
Evening Standard,"Jeremy Corbyn close to shock Islington North win in London at General Election, new poll",[],Nicholas Cecil,20 June 2024 at 1:05 am·3-min read,20,June,2024,01:05:00,3,"Jeremy Corbyn is within touching distance of pulling off a shock win in Islington North, according to a new poll.The MRP survey by YouGov has Labour beating its former leader, who is standing as an independent.But the race in this north London constituency is so tight that YouGov describes it as a “toss up”.The pollster classified this seat as such as this contest could be settled by fewer than five points.It put Labour on 41 per cent, with Mr Corbyn on 36 per cent.As the general election hots up, The Evening Standard has drawn up an interactive map of all the key battlegrounds in London on July 4.The YouGov poll also showed the political establishment facing a second potential blow, with Reform UK leader Nigel Farage set to win in Clacton, which would make him an MP at the eighth time of trying.Reform UK is also in line for second place finishes in eight London seats, taking around 27 per cent of the vote in Dagenham and Rainham, according to the survey.Mr Farage’s party is set to win around a fifth of the vote in five seats (including two that are tight Labour/Tory races) which are Bexleyheath and Crayford, Hornchurch and Upminster, Romford and Old Bexley and Sidcup, as well as Dagenham and Rainham.Ahead of the election, Labour chiefs refused to allow Mr Corbyn to stand as their candidate in the seat he has represented since 1983, after the anti-semitism storm during his leadership.Local Labour councillor Praful Nargund is instead the party’s candidate.But Leftwinger Mr Corbyn has a strong local following and this race appears to still be open as to who will win.If the former leader did pull off a surprise win it would be a blow to Sir Keir Starmer.Some Labour party members in Islington North have accused the leadership of acting undemocratically in blocking them from selected Mr Corbyn as their candidate, a claim rejected by Sir Keir.The Tories are set to lose a string of seats across London on July 4, according to the poll.They would be left with just six constituencies: Bromley and Biggin Hill, Finchley and Golders Green, Hornchurch and Upminster, Orpington, Romford, and Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner.The Conservatives would be wiped out in Inner London, losing Cities of London and Westminster, Chelsea and Fulham, and the new constituency of Kensington and Bayswater.The Liberal Democrats would also gain three seats from the Tories; Wimbledon, Sutton and Cheam, as well as Carshalton and Wallington.The Conservatives are on course to finish second in 32 constituencies in London, though three of them are “toss ups” – Croydon South, Harrow East, and Old Bexley and Sidcup, where Labour is narrowly ahead in all three.How London’s political map will look on July 5, according to new YouGov poll (YouGov)YouGov said its latest study projects Labour is on course to achieve a 200-seat majority nationwide.Labour is predicted to secure 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.YouGov used a technique known as MRP (multi-level regression and post-stratification) to model the outcome of the election in every constituency across Britain.It said the estimated seat projections were based on modelled responses from 36,161 adults in England and Wales, and 3,818 in Scotland."

Follow The Telegraph’s general election live coverageWhat are the voter ID requirements?Everyone wanting to vote in the UK must produce photo ID to take part in certain elections.For voters in England, Scotland and Wales, this includes UK parliamentary elections, by-elections and recall petitions. Those in England also need their ID for local elections.The requirement does not apply to Holyrood, Senedd or council elections in Scotland and Wales. People in Northern Ireland already needed photo ID to vote, so the rule change does not affect them.Voters in both England and Wales also need ID for police and crime commissioner elections.The rule has been applied in stages, beginning with the local elections in England on May 4, 2023. This year’s general election will be the first time ID is required for a national poll.The change marks a significant departure from the previous system in most of the UK, where voters only had to verbally confirm their name and address.What types of ID are accepted?Voters are required to show one form of photo ID at the polls, and it does not need to be in date so long as it is recognisable as the person at the ballot box.However, it must be the original version – not a photocopy – and the name on the ID should be the same as it appears on the electoral register.Acceptable forms of voter ID include:Passport issued by the UK, any of the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, a British Overseas Territory, an EEA state or a Commonwealth country (including an Irish Passport Card)Full or provisional driving licence issued by the UK, any of the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, or an EEA stateA Blue BadgeAny identity card bearing the Pass (Proof of Age Standards Scheme) hologramAny of the following travel passes:Older person’s bus pass funded by the GovernmentDisabled person’s bus pass funded by the GovernmentOyster 60+ card funded by the GovernmentFreedom passScottish national entitlement card issued for the purpose of concessionary travel (including a 60+, disabled or under 22s bus pass)60 and over Welsh concessionary travel cardDisabled person’s Welsh concessionary travel cardSenior SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandRegistered blind SmartPass or blind person’s SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandWar disablement SmartPass issued in Northern Ireland60+ SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandHalf fare SmartPass issued in Northern IrelandAny of these government-issued documents:Biometric immigration documentMinistry of Defence Form 90 (Defence Identity Card)National identity card issued by an EEA stateElectoral identity card issued in Northern IrelandVoter authority certificateAnonymous elector’s documentDo the rules apply to postal votes?No. You do not need to have any form of photo ID to vote by post.However, you will be asked to provide your National Insurance (NI) number when you apply to verify your identity. If you are not able to do this, you will need to explain why.The deadline to apply for a postal vote was 5pm on Wednesday June 19 in England, Scotland and Wales, with Saturday June 15 the limit in Northern Ireland. You must also already have registered to vote.How can I get a voter ID card?You can apply for a free voter authority certificate (VAC) either online or by post. To complete an online application, you will need a recent, digital photo of yourself and your NI number.You can still apply if you don’t have an NI number but you will need to provide alternative documents as proof of identity, such as your birth certificate, a bank statement or utility bill.To apply by post, you will need to fill out and send a form to your local electoral registration office.You will need the address of where you are registered to vote, a recent photo of yourself and your NI number.Again, other supporting documents are accepted but using these may prolong the application process.The electoral registration office must receive your form by 5pm, six working days before the election you wish to vote in.There is a different form to complete if you want to apply by post and you are living abroad, a member of the Armed Forces, a civil servant or a British Council employee.What if I do not have a valid ID?Anyone without a form of ID that fits the requirements can apply for a VAC.This is not a substitute to registering for vote, which must be done in advance of any application.Why was voter ID introduced?The aim was to stamp out voter fraud by forcing people to prove their identity at the polls.In his Government-commissioned report, Lord Pickles warned that the authorities were in a “state of denial” and “turning a blind eye” to the problem of electoral fraud.Why is voter ID so controversial?The Government has said the change is necessary to curb the “inexcusable potential” for “stealing someone’s vote” by simply quoting their name and address at the ballot box.However, critics say actual claims of electoral fraud are very rare in the UK.In 2019, the last general election year, there were only 33 allegations of impersonation at the polling station out of more than 58 million votes cast, according to the Electoral Reform Society.Opponents of the rule have also warned it will make it more difficult for certain people to vote, including the disabled, transgender and non-binary people, and black and ethnic minority groups."
The Independent,"Boris, a Jaguar XJL and a Greggs: on the campaign trail with Jacob Rees-Mogg",[],Alex Ross,19 June 2024 at 1:30 pm·9-min read,19,June,2024,01:30:00,9,"On display inside Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg’s untidy office are three large portraits: Sir Winston Churchill, Boris Johnson and himself.They hang from cream-coloured wallpaper behind a cluttered wooden desk at the centre of the HQ for Sir Jacob’s uphill campaign to win the North East Somerset and Hanham constituency – his fifth straight term in the area.“Boris went up when he became leader... we always had the leader up,” says Sir Jacob, looking up at the pictures. “Then Covid came and we’ve hardly used the office since.”No Liz Truss, then. But what about Rishi Sunak, will he get his place next to Churchill?‘Um... well, we will eventually,” Sir Jacob says, with a wry smile. “We’ll see how much we need it after the election, when he’s returned comfortably as PM. Yes, absolutely.”It’s 17 days to polling day on 4 July and I’m in Keynsham, on the edge of Bristol, following Sir Jacob’s general election campaign.The HQ for Sir Jacob’s campaign is a hive of activity ahead of morning canvassing (The Independent)Hidden down an alleyway between Bargain Booze and a local solicitor’s firm, it’s a struggle at first to find the office (I initially mistake it for the former Keynsham and District Conservative Club, where early-morning drinkers are sipping their first pint) but I get there eventually.Boxes of delivery leaflets cover most of the carpeted floor while the chairs and the steep stairwell are filled with around eight friendly members sipping coffee and chatting before the day’s canvassing.“The national polls... you know, we don’t read those,” says Margaret Brewer, Sir Jacob’s upbeat agent, with the latest poll from Ipsos projecting the worst post-war result for the Tory party.Suddenly, Sir Jacob appears at the doorway wearing a dark grey double-breasted suit with a large blue rosette.We shake hands before he picks an issue up with his agent. The local BBC channel is planning an election debate, and he’s concerned the Green Party candidate has not been invited.A map showing the redrawn constituency is displayed in Jacob Rees-Mogg’s office (The Independent)“It doesn’t seem fair,” he says, showing genuine concern, before heading outside to discuss the plan for the day in private.Sir Jacob was elected MP for North East Somerset 14 years ago. It’s a constituency he’s comically described as circling the city of Bath – where Lib Dem Wera Hobhouse was previously MP – like dough around the jam in a doughnut.But his political rite of passage came in 1997 when he was parachuted into a virtually unwinnable seat for the Tory party in Central Fife. A quick search online reveals pictures of the smartly dressed 27-year-old knocking on working-class doors.“There was no Bentley, sadly,” Sir Jacob laughs, correcting subsequent media coverage as he fondly recalls the campaign. “I’d knock on people’s doors and say, ‘I’m Jacob Rees-Mogg, I’m the Conservative candidate, can I count on you for your support?’“More often than not, people would laugh ... they did think it was very funny that a Tory was asking for their vote.”Fast forward 27 years, and electoral campaigning for Sir Jacob remains “very similar” – although in Longwell Green, where we are heading for canvassing today, the reception is likely to be different.The pretty urban suburb on the edge of east Bristol has a strong Conservative following – five out of the six local councillors are Tories – which Sir Jacob wants to cement ahead of the general election.‘More often than not, people would laugh,’ says Sir Jacob, thinking back to his first election campaign in Central Fife (Getty/Colin McPherson)And unlike on the Central Fife campaign, there’s no family nanny, Veronica Crook, in tow while knocking on doors – although his mother, Lady Gillian Rees-Mogg, does show up in the afternoon to help in the office.It takes eight minutes to drive from Keynsham to Longwell Green, where it doesn’t take long to spot the lanky figure of Sir Jacob talking to a woman in a cul-de-sac, or his smart Jaguar XJL parked nearby.This is a leafy area with a modern housing estate of large semi-detached homes, many with pristine front gardens. With the sun out, many residents are busy mowing lawns and cutting hedges.The area, like the neighbouring wards of Bitton and Hanham, will join the old North Somerset constituency as part of boundary changes at the election.But polling isn’t looking good for Sir Jacob.Labour’s Dan Norris, mayor of the West of England and former MP for the seat, is projected to win comfortably, with 42 per cent of the vote according to Survation’s MRP, followed by Sir Jacob on 27 per cent, Lib Dems on 14 per cent and Reform UK with 12 per cent.Mr Norris’s election leaflet features a “Stop Rees-Mogg” stamp. “Absolutely delighted that he’s advertising me,” says Sir Jacob.Sir Jacob accepts the national polls are “not encouraging reading for the Conservatives”, but he urges caution at “an extrapolation of a national poll into a constituency poll” for the local projections.Voter Geoff Meek shakes Sir Jacob’s hand during canvassing in Longwell Green (The Independent)And on the doorstep in Longwell Green, the early signs are promising.After finishing talking to the woman on her front lawn, Sir Jacob goes to two addresses where people tell the former business secretary he has their vote. At the second address, a resident who is taking a break from fixing his dishwasher shares his main issues: “Immigration and the taxes if Labour get in.”But around the corner, problems arise for Sir Jacob and his team.First, a mother holding her three-month-old baby abruptly says she won’t be voting for Sir Jacob, then, at the next door, a man says he’s considering voting for Reform UK.The theme continues at the next semi-detached home where a family are working on an extension outside.“We have always voted Tory but we’re feeling really disappointed,” says one of them. “People feel they [the Conservative Party] haven’t delivered on the things they promised to do. We are losing our culture because of mass migration.”Sir Jacob accepts their frustration. “We made a mistake,” he says, pointing to an expanded migrant labour force after the Covid pandemic. Legal migration is coming back under control, he says.But it doesn’t end there.One of the family draws parallels between Sir Jacob, Nigel Farage and Reform UK. “Why not be Reform?” he asks.“The party is bigger than the leader – the membership of the party has the view I have,” replies Sir Jacob, who goes on to openly question the quality of candidates standing for Reform.“A vote for them is a vote for Lib Dems or Labour,” he adds.But then he finds more support.Self-employed builder Geoff Meek, 58, stops work on a semi-detached property to shake Sir Jacob’s hand. “Things are going well for us,” he says, pointing to a rise in the national insurance threshold.Couple David and Ann Hockney also warmly welcome Sir Jacob at the doorstep of their home, although Ms Hockney, 71, admits she’s toying with voting for Reform UK. “Immigration,” she says, when I ask why.Down one cul-de-sac, at a large detached home, a woman who shakes Sir Jacob’s hand jokes she won’t wash her hands again.A retired man, Mike Morrison, standing outside his garage also gives the incumbent his backing.The 87-year-old, who has lived in the area for 43 years, tells Sir Jacob the former Tory MP Chris Skidmore, who resigned from his Kingswood seat over Mr Sunak’s oil and gas licence plan in January, used to live around the corner.Mark Bray tells Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg he’s undecided on who to vote for. Asked what the big issues are locally, he points toward a 5G mast near his home (The Independent)“The rotter,” quips Mr Morrison.That’s the next stop; Mr Skidmore’s old address, a detached home with a large driveway. Owner Martyn Chugg says he’ll be voting for Sir Jacob, adding that Reform UK’s manifesto is in “cuckoo land”.The 70-year-old says affordable housing is a big issue of the election, with his son in his thirties still living at the family home.As I watch the canvassers begin to wrap up the morning’s proceedings, plumber Anthony Murphy, 44, tells Sir Jacob he’ll be voting Reform. “Nigel is the only one who talks sense,” he tells me.I ask Sir Jacob how it’s gone.“It seems pretty encouraging,” he says, “but you’ve got to be careful. People are nice and good-mannered, and if someone’s polite to you it doesn’t necessarily mean they will be voting Conservative for you.“It’s very easy to assume a friendly comment, even a selfie, means they are a supporter, but it’s not always true.”Back in the office for lunch, where Sir Jacob has a Greggs ham and cheese sandwich and a box of eclairs, I put to him the possibility of losing his seat.“If you throw your hat in the ring, you must expect that sometimes people will throw the hat back at you,” he says.I then ask if he’s worried it could provide a “Portillo” moment – when former Tory leader contender Michael Portillo was defeated in 1997 – on election night.“If you look at the opinion polls, there can be about 100 Portillo moments,” Sir Jacob adds, with a laugh. “Portillo will have bred and taken over the world if it’s going quite the way the opinion polls indicate, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens.”The interview ends, and I realise I’ve been sipping Sir Jacob’s black coffee.“Oh, don’t worry,” he says, with a smile, as I leave him to finish lunch with his agent and mother ahead of a busy afternoon of canvassing in the battle for his political career."

as well, for example make sure that many of the public bodies that we all rely on to help to run our lives, instead of having a balance of people from across the political spectrum with real skills

He says: “There are opinion polls, as I’ve acknowledged and as we both know, that are not great, but it’s not the 90th minute, we’re not in ‘Fergie time’ yet.“There is still an opportunity for us to make these arguments and as we make these arguments my experience – and I know it’s just me and a range of seats, not every seat in the country – my experience is that when you do talk to voters, outline some of the tax dangers, outline some of Labour’s plans for the future, then people do think twice and people do recognise that by voting Conservatives you are both ensuring that there is a strong Conservative voice in Parliament, but also you are doing everything you can to prevent a series of tax increases that won’t just hit pensioners and first-time buyers, but also will hit the economy in the guts.”He added: “I’m a Scotland fan, so you wait until the final whistle.“Sometimes it looks as though the odds are against you, but you keep on fighting.” (Sky News)Michael Gove: Tories betting on election date ‘deeply disturbing’07:34 , Salma OuaguiraThe housing secretary is speaking to Sky News as part of the morning media round.

It had looked likely that Rishi Sunak would wait until the autumn to call the next election, but the Prime Minister announced in a rain-sodden speech outside of Downing Street on May 22 that July 4 was the chosen date.Follow The Telegraph’s live general election coverageMany assumed Mr Sunak would want more time for the new Rwanda deterrent and recent tax cuts to take effect, having described a ballot in the second half of the year as his “working assumption”.But speculation reached fever pitch in Westminster when the Conservatives refused to rule out an election being called that day. That afternoon, an umbrella-less Mr Sunak announced his snap election decision and set in motion the vote to happen six weeks later on July 4.The choice means that Mr Sunak will have been in No 10 for 618 days by the polling date and has been called a “mistake” by figures like Prof Sir John Curtice, the polling expert.Why is there an election now?Tory figures close to general election planning had also been working under the assumption there was not going to be a summer ballot, but that all changed on May 22.Lord Cameron cut a trip to Albania short in order to return to a Cabinet meeting and Grant Shapps delayed a flight to a Nato meeting two hours to be there.On the day of the announcement, news came that the rate of inflation had fallen even further than expected, which Mr Sunak hailed as a sign that “everything is heading in the right direction”.With the Government’s record perhaps at its strongest on the economy, the Prime Minister was keen to use the news as a launchpad for triggering the election – but what else played into his decision?Key factors for the Prime Minister would have included whether economic statistics was continuing to improve, and whether polling and focus group research suggested that voters were feeling the positive effects of the National Insurance cuts, crediting the Tories for the boost.Getting Rwanda deportation flights off the ground also strengthened the case for going to the polls in the summer, along with a steady decline in the NHS elective waiting list.It had been rumoured that figures in Downing Street were mulling over whether it would be in the Tories’ interests to trigger a ballot sooner rather than later, despite being way behind Labour in the polls.Why was the general election not on the same day as the local elections?The general election could have been called on May 2 - the same day as the locals - but Rishi Sunak made the decision to avoid a spring poll.The Institute for Government pointed out that a spring election would avoid the risk that “a heavy defeat in the local elections could increase pressure on the Prime Minister – including from within his party – and make it difficult to regain momentum ahead of an election that would by then be less than a year away”.However, that opportunity passed. On March 14, the Prime Minister ruled out a national ballot on May 2, confirming there “won’t be a general election on that day”.It was thought that heavy losses at the locals could tempt restless Tory MPs to mount a challenge against their leader.However, despite a dire set of results for the Conservatives, resulting in hundreds of council seats lost, the rebels appear to have backed off for now.What happens next? Following Mr Sunak’s announcement on May 22, Parliament was prorogued and dissolved eight days later on May 30 after the Prime Minister was granted permission by the King Charles.Prorogation happened on May 24, in line with the 2022 Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act that sets out polling day to take place 25 working days following the dissolution on May 30, landing the general election on July 4.Election candidates have begun to use the six-week lead up to ballot day to campaign for their parties, including both Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer who have undertaken appearances up and down the country.Both leaders, and many other political figures, have also taken part in TV election debates in a bid to win over voters and released their 2024 party manifestos, starting with the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives. It is up to each party when to publish its manifesto, but an analysis by the Institute for Government shows that all Labour and Conservative manifestos since 1997 have been launched between 18 and 29 days before the election.How are general elections called?It is up to the Prime Minister to decide when to hold a national vote, but this power has only been restored in recent years.In 2011, the Fixed Term Parliaments Act effectively put the House of Commons in charge, with general elections held every five years unless a majority of MPs willed it otherwise.For an election to be called early, two thirds of the House had to back the plans. This is how Theresa May’s snap election was triggered in 2017. Alternatively, MPs could spark a ballot by passing a vote of no confidence in the Government.After trying and failing three times to secure the necessary two thirds majority for an early vote in 2019, the Tories opted to circumvent the law with a new purpose-built piece of legislation - the Early Parliamentary General Election Act - which required only a simple majority to pass. This paved the way for Boris Johnson’s snap election in 2019.The Government went on to repeal the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, replacing it with the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act. This new law stripped the Commons of its power to block an early ballot, putting the Prime Minister back in control.Traditionally, the Prime Minister travels to Buckingham Palace to request the dissolution of Parliament, before returning to Downing Street to announce the forthcoming election.How often are elections called? Each Parliament must be dissolved for a general election by the fifth anniversary of the day it first met.This measure was passed under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act by the 2011 coalition government, which set in stone the five-year periods between general elections.Elections may be held earlier – such occurred in 2017 with Theresa May and 2019 by Boris Johnson following a Brexit deadlock – under special circumstances.However, local elections such as the May 2024 by-elections and mayoral elections operate on a different time scale. Who can vote in the general election?The vast majority of UK adults can vote in a general election.In order to vote, you must:be registered to votebe 18 or over on the day of the election (‘polling day’)be a British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizenbe a resident at an address in the UK or Gibraltar, or living abroad and registered as an overseas voter (it is also possible to register if you have no fixed address)not be legally excluded from voting (for example, if you are serving a prison sentence)When should I register to vote?The deadline for registering to vote has now passed. Registration usually stays open until midnight at the end of the 12th working day before polling day, meaning the window closed on June 18 at 11.59pm. The deadline to vote by post passed the following day at 5pm.For those who are registered, it is still possible to apply for a proxy vote until 5pm on June 26.When will polling take place?Parliament was dissolved a few days after the election announcement and polling day takes place 25 working days after that.The Civil Service has entered “purdah” – the period between an election being called and polling day which involves strict restrictions on the work of officials to ensure that Whitehall resources are not being used to benefit any party in particular."

Sir Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak will be joined by John Swinney and Sir Ed Davey to face questions from members of the public.Another head to head between Sir Keir and the Conservative leader will follow on June 26, before what is expected to be the final programme of the election campaign, another BBC Question Time special featuring Nigel Farage on June 28 – less than a week before the nation goes to the polls.What channel are the debates on?ITV and the BBC have confirmed they will host general election debates over the campaign.The programmes will be available on BBC1, BBC News and ITV1, as well as live on their streaming platforms BBC Iplayer and ITVX.For those watching from Scotland, the ITV debates will be on the equivalent channel STV.ITV also streamed the first debate on June 4 live on their Youtube channel and are expected, along with the BBC, to do the same for the following programmes.The BBC have also confirmed they will air their debates on local radio.Sky’s debate will be available to watch on Freeview and can be streamed online at the Sky News website or on social media.The Telegraph will be providing live coverage of all the debates with expert analysis and reaction.Question Time special - June 20, 8pm on the BBCThe BBC will return tonight to host a Question Time Leader’s special with representatives of the UK’s four largest parties: the Conservatives, Labour Party, SNP and Liberal Democrats.Fiona Bruce will lead the broadcast from 8pm to 10pm in York and speak to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, Rishi Sunak, John Swinney and Sir Ed Davey.During the programme, each leader will be granted a thirty-minute slot to answer audience questions.Sunak and Starmer head to head - June 26, 9pm on the BBCThe BBC will host what is likely to be the 2024 election campaign’s final TV debate on Wednesday June 26 – one week before the country will head to the polls.The programme will be another head to head between Mr Sunak and Mr Starmer only, similar to the ITV debate they took part in on June 4 and hosted by Sophie Raworth, the BBC news presenter.It will kick off at 9pm and run until 10pm.Sir Keir agreed to the two head-to-head discussions only and said he would not speak at the larger debates happening on either channel.Question Time special - June 28, 8pm on the BBCFollowing complaints from the leader of Reform after he was not invited to attend the first Question Time special, the broadcaster has announced a second programme on Friday June 28.The corporation said it has added the second billing to its election coverage to reflect “the fact that it is clear from across a broad range of opinion polls that the support for Reform UK has been growing”.Mr Farage had demanded a spot on Thursday’s programme after an opinion poll put his party ahead of the Conservatives and has said he is “pleased” with the BBC’s recognition of his party’s growing favour.The Question Time special will be hosted by Fiona Bruce from 8pm and the Green Party has also been invited to attend.How many debates will there be before the election?So far, a total of seven debates will be held in the run-up to the general election on July 4, with three left to go following ITV’s seven-way debate on Thursday June 13.The debate announcements were confirmed after the Tories had pressed Sir Keir to take part in a record six debates during the six-week election countdown.Conservative sources had dubbed the opposition leader “the knight that won’t fight” and “Sir Fear Starmer” after he failed to sign up to their weekly debate demand.Labour headquarters indicated instead that their leader would take part in two head-to-head debates against Mr Sunak, matching what Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn did ahead of the 2019 election.Will the debates clash with any football fixtures?There are several clashes between debate timings and football fixtures – an inevitability with the jam-packed TV schedules.Football fans and politics watchers were torn on June 7, when the BBC’s debate with the seven parties coincided with England’s international warm-up with Iceland on Channel 4.England will play Denmark this evening – the same day as the BBC’s Question Time Leaders’ Special – but at an earlier kick-off time of 5pm before the election programme at 8pm.So there is only one BBC clash taking place as the channel managed to avoid competing with the Men’s European Championship fixtures.There are no more ITV football fixture clashes after the broadcaster moved the England Women’s Euros match with France, which had been due to air on ITV1, to ITV4 as it coincided with Mr Sunak and Mr Starmer’s head to head on June 4.When is the general election?The general election will take place on July 4 as the country heads to the polls between 7am and 10pm to have their say over the next prime minister.It was confirmed by Rishi Sunak in a rain-sodden speech outside of Downing Street on May 22 that the election would happen six weeks later. Both the Prime Minister and other party leaders have been on the campaign trail since then in a bid to win over voters through measures such as the TV debates."
Yahoo News UK,What is tactical voting and why are some people against it?UK voters will head to the polls to elect the next prime minister on 4 July.,"['What is tactical voting?', 'How does tactical voting work?', 'The argument against tactical voting', 'How could tactical voting impact the 2024 election?']",Jimmy Nsubuga,Updated 19 June 2024 at 1:37 pm·5-min read,19,June,2024,01:37:00,5,"UK voters will head to the polls to elect the next prime minister in two weeks' time on 4 July.Political parties have been busy campaigning following the snap election announcement by Rishi Sunak, who revealed the vote would be held on Thursday 4 July.The Conservatives are currently trailing Labour by a significant margin in the polls, with the latest polling figures showing Labour projected to potentially secure a record number of MPs and the Sunak himself in danger of losing his seat, which would make him the first sitting prime minister to do so.Other high-profile Tory MPs - including Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Liz Truss - are also facing the prospect of being ousted by voters.Some tactical voting campaigners are eager to make this a reality - with the Conservatives (as the sitting party in government) the most likely to be on the sharp end of such initiatives.Indeed, the Best for Britain campaign group says it wants to inflict the “heaviest possible election defeat” on the Conservatives. It believes that its GetVoting.org initiative could help oust several prominent Tories, including Sunak and Hunt.What is tactical voting?Tactical voting is when someone chooses to vote for a candidate who would not be their first choice, or perhaps a candidate they would not even have considered voting for previously.The idea is that by voting for that candidate, you are doing your bit to stop another candidate winning.It tends to apply in constituencies where two candidates are close in numbers, and significantly out in front of their opponents.Some voters employ tactical voting as a strategy to counter the UK's 'First Past The Post' (FPTP) voting system, where a candidate with the most votes wins.This can result in an MP being elected even though the majority of voters supported candidates from a different political spectrum.For example, a Conservative candidate may win in their local constituency if the vote is divided between left-wing candidates from the Labour and Green Party.Voters will head to the [polls on 4 July. (Getty)How does tactical voting work?A scenario where tactical voting could come into play is when a voter’s preferred candidate is likely to come third with no realistic chance of winning.In this case, the voter could vote tactically by choosing to vote for one of the two candidates who will win the seat.John Boken, a 43-year-old secondary school teacher from Oswestry, is one of millions of registered voters who is preparing to cast his vote for a party that is not his top preference.Despite his inclination towards Labour, Boken feels he has to support the Liberal Democrats to prevent the Conservative candidate from securing the seat in his constituency.An example of tactical voting in action would be a traditional Labour voter who voted for Brexit in 2016 opting to vote for the Conservative candidate in their constituency in the hope of getting a Tory majority and avoiding a hung parliament which they may fear would lead to a second EU referendum.On the other hand, a traditional Tory voter who wants the UK to remain in the EU could lend their vote to the Labour or Lib Dem candidates in a bid to avoid a Conservative majority government.Meanwhile, back in 1997, tactical voting group Get Rid of Them (Grot) targeted 90 seats across the country where tactical voting could secure the defeat of the Tory candidate.And in 2017, the then Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron called on traditional Tory and Labour supporters to vote tactically to bring Conservative numbers down.The argument against tactical votingOne problem with this approach, some argue, is that you end up with a situation where a voter is choosing a candidate who's policies they may disagree with.The Electoral Reform Society, a campaign group opposed to the first-past-the-post system, says switching to some form of proportional representation (PR) would remove the need for tactical voting.Such a system would see, for example, a party that receives one-third of the vote expecting to gain one-third of the seats in parliament.They say this would remove much of the impetus for voters to try and hack their way around the current system.In a blog post on the group's website in 2022, Willie Sullivan wrote: ""No voter should have to vote tactically. But tactical voting is an inevitable symptom of our failing first-past-the-post system used for Westminster elections.""As voters are given just one preference and only one candidate can become the MP in each constituency, votes for all the other candidates go to waste. This all-or-nothing system means that voters have to choose between voting with their hearts or working around the system to get the best outcome in their area.""This kind of voter behaviour is ... sadly a symptom of our electoral system anytime votes head to the polls. The 2019 general election was the most recent example of a ‘hold your nose’ election – where millions of voters were forced to vote for the ‘least worst option.""Your guide to votingHow to register to vote in the 2024 general electionWhat voter ID can I bring to the election?Who is standing in my constituency?

The Telegraph,Middle Britons – the political tribe who will decide the election,"['Left-wing narratives', 'Key voters for most parties', '‘Left-behind patriots’']",Will Hazell,20 June 2024 at 0:03 am·3-min read,20,June,2024,00:03:00,3,"“Middle Britons” with no political affiliation are likely to decide the outcome of the election by swinging the result in marginal constituencies, research suggests.According to analysis by the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen), middle Britons will be the most important of six political “tribes” on July 4 because they dominate two-thirds of the marginal seats being fought over by the Conservatives and Labour.Earlier this year, Prof Sir John Curtice and Lovisa Moller, NatCen’s director of analysis, led a team to categorise the British electorate into six groups based on the British social attitudes survey.Middle Britons describes a group of people mostly sitting in the middle ground when it comes to their views across a range of issues.Left-wing narrativesAccording to NatCen, people with a middle-Briton opinion profile express mild agreement with Left-wing narratives, are divided in their attitudes towards tax-and-spend policies, largely neutral on equal opportunities and agree on the need to be tough on crime.Critically, people in the group do not see themselves as a supporter of any particular party.NatCen’s research shows that this opinion profile dominates marginal seats contested between the Conservatives and Labour in 2019, and also represents an important segment of support for Reform UK, the Scottish National Party and the Liberal Democrats.In the 90 English and Welsh seats where Labour would have been the runner-up to the Tories in 2019, with a gap of less than 20 per cent of the votes, about two-thirds have middle Britons as the dominant voter segment.This includes “red wall” seats such as Ashfield, Bishop Auckland and Bolsover, as well new seats created by boundary changes for the 2024 election that would have been won with a narrow margin in 2019, including Birmingham Northfield, Leeds South West and Morley, and North Norfolk.Key voters for most partiesMiddle Britons are also the second-most important voter segment for most parties.Interviews by NatCen before the election campaign began found that the Tories, Labour, Reform, the SNP and the Lib Dems all had middle Britons as their second-most important supporter base, making up between 22 per cent and 28 per cent of each party’s estimated support at the time.NatCen published the briefing to coincide with a new data release which will allow people to look up the demographic profile of each constituency in England and Wales, including which of the six voter types most dominate in that seat.As well as middle Britons, the other groups are: well-off traditionalists, apolitical centrists, left-behind patriots, urban progressives and soft-Left liberals.The Tories derive the biggest source of their support from well-off traditionalists, who make up 38 per cent of their supporter base.For Labour, the Green Party and the SNP, urban progressives are the biggest segment among their voters, making up 28 per cent, 37 per cent and 35 per cent of their respective support bases.‘Left-behind patriots’Soft-Left liberals are the number one segment for the Lib Dems (32 per cent) and left-behind patriots are the lead group for Reform (33 per cent).Ms Moller said: “We hope these tools will enable political commentators and others to assess the voter coalitions that parties are seeking to appeal to, and how this might shape their campaigning.“It will also, post election, give us a sense of how people voted, and insight into the range of opinion profiles that any winning party or parties will need to take into account once in power.”"
The Independent,Tory scandal grows as second candidate linked to Sunak’s inner circle faces questions over election gambling,[],David Maddox,20 June 2024 at 3:08 am·3-min read,20,June,2024,03:08:00,3,"The Gambling Commission is investigating a second Tory candidate for taking a bet on the date of the election who may have had inside knowledge ahead of Rishi Sunak’s surprise announcement.The candidate understood to be under investigation is Laura Saunders, who is running for the Tories in Bristol North West and has worked for the party since 2015. It was also revealed that she is married to Tony Lee, the Conservative Party’s director of campaigns.This follows an admission by one of the prime minister’s closest aides Crag Williams that he “took a flutter” on the election date just days before it was announced.Two candidates linked to the prime minister’s inner circle are being investigated over betting on the election date (James Manning/PA Wire)It has led to concerns of corruption in Mr Sunak’s inner circle using inside knowledge to profit from betting.Asked about reports the Gambling Commission was investigating a second Conservative candidate for placing a bet on the date of the election, Mr Gove told the BBC: “If people have used inside information to place bets, that is deeply wrong.“What I can’t do is sort of get too much into the detail of the case while an investigation is going on.“But I can talk about the broad principle and you’re absolutely right, it’s reprehensible.”Craig Williams served as the Prime Minister’s parliamentary private secretary and is under investigation over an alleged bet (UK Parliament/PA) (PA Media)Michael Gove has said it would be “reprehensible” for someone to use inside information to bet on the date of the General Election.Mr Williams, who was Mr Sunak’s parliamentary private secretary, has since returned the money and apologised but is also under investigation from the Gambling Commisson.But pressure is mounting for the Tories to take tougher action after it was reported a close protection officer for the prime minister was suspended by the Metropolitan Police and being investigated.Ms Saunders has not commented on the allegation.However, a Conservative Party spokesman told the BBC: “We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals. As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn’t be proper to comment further, until any process is concluded.”It is understood that the Met was contacted by the Gambling Commission on 14 June to be told that it was investigating alleged bets made by a police constable from the Met’s Royalty and Specialist Protection Command.The Met told the BBC: “The matter was immediately referred to officers in the Met’s Directorate of Professional Standards, who opened an investigation, and the officer was also removed from operational duties.”Responding to the latest allegations against Ms Saunders, Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: ""Rishi Sunak must find his backbone and suspend Laura Saunders from the Conservative party whilst this investigation is ongoing.""It would be an utter disgrace if Conservative politicians were shown to be more focussed on turning a quick buck rather than the needs of the country.""The Conservative party has proven itself utterly unfit for office. Voters are sick to the back teeth of this endless carousel of chaos, sleaze and scandal.""People across the country are crying out for change and that is why in many areas they are backing the Liberal Democrats to get a strong local champion that will take their issues right to the heart of Parliament and not take them for granted any longer."""
